the bulgarian socialist party led with 42 percent to 44 percent of the votes and the main anti-communist union of democratic forces had roughly 24 percent according to three bulgarian groups monitoring preliminary election results
the percentage for the mainly turkish movement for rights and freedoms was not given but apparently it managed to clear the 4 percent hurdle to win seats in parliament it appeared no other party would garner enough votes for parliamentary representation
the three groups making the early forecast were the local gallup international affiliate the bulgarian association for free elections and the civic initiative for free and democratic elections
pre-election opinion polls had given the socialists 30 percent and the union of democratic forces 20 percent
earlier in the day socialist leader zhan videnov a 35-year-old economic expert said he expected a success of the left-wing forces and a crushing defeat of those whose idea of transition has proved a fiasco
after casting his ballot president zhelyu zhelev said if there is a strong and working parliament there also will be a strong and working executive the state news agency bta reported
in a surprise tv appearance saturday night zhelev urged bulgarians to vote in large numbers hinting their support for smaller parties could help break the parliamentary deadlock
some of the voters were pessimistic about the future following years of government crises and parliamentary deadlock
i am very disappointed i have almost no hope after all that happened in the last few years in this country said marina sapundzhieva a clerk in her mid 40s
nikolai danev a lawyer and udf activist predicted that unless one of the two major parties achieves a clear majority in parliament the result will be early elections in six months or a year at the most
the two major parties appear to agree on only one thing the need to combat rampant crime and corruption which threaten to undermine the still shaky democratic system
police statistics say that corruption has cost the country an estimated 118 billion leva dlrs 180 million this year
annual inflation in bulgaria is expected to reach 120 percent by the end of the year some 70 percent of the population of 85 million live on the verge of poverty and about 740000 are jobless
the socialists now support market reforms but they plead for a slow transition to avoid hardship for those with low incomes including pensioners and the unemployed

two brilliant opening rounds were enough for ernie els who won the johnnie walker world championship sunday with a routine 2-under-par 69 that gave him a six-shot triumph
els started the season-ending tournament with a pair of 64s he had a seven-shot lead going into the final round and never led by fewer than five strokes in winning dlrs 550000 and yet another world title els finished with a 72-hole total of 16-under 268
mark mccumber and nick faldo each shot 67 to finish at 274 ian woosnam and paul azinger were another shot back after final-round 68s tied with brad faxon who fired a 64 to finish at 275
a 64 might have been enough to put a scare into els but it would have had to come from someone like nick price who started the final round closest to els
price the world's no 1 player who won two majors this year made up only one shot over the first nine holes with a 1-meter 4-foot birdie at no 8 he dropped off the leaderboard with a double bogey at the par-3 13th price finished with a 72 for 278
that was his last trouble until reaching the back nine which he had dominated throughout the tournament his drive missed going out of bounds by 2 meters 6 feet at the 10th and a tree blocked his approach instead of laying up short of a ditch els played a risky shot left of the green and saved par again
he made birdies at both par 5s on the back nine
you're not going to overcome a lead like that said england's david gilford who finished at 276 that's asking a lot sometimes ernie els is the best player in the world
els' 268 was two strokes short of the 266 larry mize shot last year in another runaway victory
els moved up to no 6 in the world rankings after starting the year ranked 20th he has won nearly dlrs 29 million this year winning five tournaments and finishing in the top five 16 times in 35 tournaments
with their crime scene search completed investigators said sunday they believed all bullets on the white house grounds had been found secret service agents reported hearing just four shots although other witnesses said they heard six
a preliminary ballistics examination found that all the bullets came from the same weapon according to a secret service statement additional tests to determine the type of weapon were to be conducted monday
nine millimeter ammunition can be fired from handguns shoulder-strap weapons and some rifles the distance a bullet can travel depends on the type of weapon used
the bullets found saturday were in good condition indicating that they were fired from a great distance and had not struck with enough force to be greatly disfigured the dining room bullet pierced the glass and just fell near the window plop one official said on condition of anonymity
that could suggest the white house was not the target several officials including chief of staff leon panetta speculated that the incident was a drive-by shooting in a city besieged by gun violence
a public street loops behind the white house grounds less than 100 yards meters from where the bullets were found
but investigators also noted that the bullets were found within a few hundred feet of each other suggesting the gunman took aim at the white house
they said there were few clues in the case and no description of a suspect

dudayev told a news conference he himself would meet only with yeltsin or russia's prime minister saying the chechen people will not allow me to meet with anyone else the itar-tass and interfax news agencies reported
moscow sent 10000 to 40000 troops into the republic in the caucasus mountains of southern russia a week ago to put down an independence drive
yeltsin has staked considerable political capital on resolving the conflict quickly and with minimum casualties the military offensive in the mostly muslim republic of about 12 million people is generally unpopular not only with the public but among russian troops
dudayev earlier agreed to meet yeltsin's representatives but later said he would not yeltsin also has demanded that dudayev agree to disarm his forces before talks something the chechen president has refused to do
yeltsin's chief of staff sergei filatov said a military offensive by moscow was possible later in the evening
on sunday morning russian planes targeted military equipment and five bridges across the terek river which divides chechnya itar-tass said interfax said electrical stations on grozny's outskirts also were hit and the villages of pervomaiskoye northeast of grozny and khankala an eastern suburb
grozny's television tower was bombed knocking out broadcasts according to state-run ostankino tv
otherwise there were no reports of bombing in the city itself but russian fighters buzzed overhead after the kremlin deadline to disarm by midnight saturday expired
russia must withdraw its forces quickly and recognize our political independence a defiant chechen vice president zelimkhan yandarbiyev said
people in grozny spent a cold anxious night saturday in basements and makeshift bomb shelters by mid-morning however traders were out at the market
what is there to be scared of said 25-year-old khaza khutoyeva as she peddled russian champagne and american cigarettes
the russian government urged women children and non-combatants to leave grozny an estimated 67000 to 100000 refugees have fled to neighboring ingushetia
early sunday russian tanks cut off the last three cars in a convoy of a dozen headed toward ingushetia from grozny in the village of nesterovskaya
the tanks opened fire on the three cars continuing to fire as refugees began running away the cars were then crushed at least nine people including four women were killed
the commanders had orders to let the refugees pass but these cars were fired upon and squashed said khamzat bekov ingushetia's emergency situations minister then they tried to conceal all the traces we cannot find the bodies the wounded
how can we save ourselves one woman told associated press television near a demolished car if our legs can take us out of here we go if not they crush us
the main thing we can do today is to organize a mass protest which would force the authorities the president to understand what kind of tragic madness they are being pushed into gaidar said
but yeltsin was supported by eduard shevardnadze leader of the former soviet republic of georgia which borders chechnya on the south itar-tass quoted shevardnadze as saying that it is important for russia to be unified and stable and therefore it must stop aggressive separatism
first projections put the bulgarian socialist party of former communists far ahead in sunday's parliamentary elections
according to three bulgarian institutes monitoring incoming elections results the socialists led with a preliminary 42-44 percent of the votes the main anti-communist union of democratic forces had roughly 24 percent

reflecting the political stalemate that has plagued bulgaria for the last three years both major parties claim the government of unaffiliated premier lyuben berov who resigned in september had been controlled by the other
thus svetoslav luchnikov justice minister in dimitrov's 10-month government in 1992 castigated the unimaginably bad policies of the berov government
dimitrov the 39-year-old udf leader only said god may grant it in response to supporters wishing him an election victory
a udf spokesman said dimitrov who has ruled out a coalition with the socialists would not comment until after results are known
in the last elections in october 1991 the socialists won 106 seats second to udf's 110 neither had a majority in the 240-seat parliament that led to two weak governments unable to push through badly needed reforms
across central and eastern europe one-time communists are on the rise
in a tv appearance saturday night president zhelyu zhelev urged bulgarians to vote in large numbers hinting their support for smaller parties could help break the parliamentary deadlock

a hand-over of saadon's body could speed the release of yassin who is serving a life sentence for slayings of palestinian collaborators plo leader yasser arafat has sought yassin's freedom in hopes it could shore up support among islamic fundamentalists for the plo's autonomy regime in the gaza strip
abu khoussa declined to say whether he knew where saadon was buried suggesting he feared such a disclosure could land him in jail i know what my fate will be if i fall in israeli intelligence hands so i don't intend to be caught alive

defender stratos apostolakis converted a first half penalty kick sunday to give greece a 1-0 victory over scotland in a group eight qualifying game for the european championship
the victory before 25000 spectators at the athens olympic stadium increased greece's chances to qualify for the 1996 finals in england
with four victories in as many games greece is atop the group with 12 points
scotland is behind with seven points from four games it is followed by finland with six points also from four games and russia with four points from two games san marino and the faeroe islands the other two teams in the group are pointless after three games each
it was a hard-fought game that forced dutch referee john blankestein to show a total of five yellow cards four to scottish players and one to a greek
the penalty was awarded when tom boyd downed alecos alexandris in the area in the 18th minute it was in essence the first attack made by one of the two teams until then the two sides measured each other at midfield
after the goal the visitors went on the attack and came close to level in the 26th minute when in a melee in front of the greek goalmouth john collins kept the ball longer and goalie ilias atmatzidis dived to block it
a scoring opportunity was also lost by the greeks in the 35th when giorgos toursounidis dribbled past three scottish defenders but shot wide with andy goram out of position
the visitors were more aggressive in the second half making constant attacks against the greek goalmouth but they were out of focus
with the scottish players almost constantly in the greek area the host players made several dangerous counter-attacks but they could not score again thanks to some key saves made by goram who was injured in the 78th and replaced by james leighton

an islamic militant offered sunday to hand over the body of an israeli soldier in exchange for israel freeing some palestinian prisoners
we think the word price is hard on the soul let's say it would be a show of good will on both sides abed rabbo abu khoussa of the islamic resistance movement's military wing said in a rare interview on israel television
abu khoussa's offer came after the movement's jailed spiritual leader sheikh ahmed yassin asked followers to reveal where soldier ilan saadon is buried saadon was kidnapped in may 1989 and believed slain by islamic militants
handing over saadon's body could speed the release of yassin who is serving a life sentence for slayings of palestinian collaborators
plo leader yasser arafat has sought yassin's freedom in hopes it could shore up support among islamic fundamentalists for the palestine liberation organization's autonomy regime in the gaza strip
abu khoussa declined to say whether he knew where saadon was buried because he feared what such a disclosure might bring i know what my fate will be if i fall in israeli intelligence hands so i don't intend to be caught alive
abu khoussa also made the swap suggestion in a telephone call to the saadon family lawyer this weekend the attorney amir abrahami said saturday
the former communists of the socialist party were far ahead in sunday's national elections but short of achieving a majority leaving bulgaria facing another government too weak to make changes according to early vote projections
according to three institutes monitoring the results the socialists led with about 43 percent of the votes and the union of democratic forces the main anti-communist grouping with 24 percent
the percentage for the mainly turkish movement for rights and freedoms was not given but apparently they managed to clear the four percent hurdle to win seats in parliament
the early projections were based on representative samples from about two percent of votes counted the three institutes making the early forecast were the local gallup international affiliate the bulgarian association for free elections and the civic initiative for free and democratic elections
reflecting the political stalemate that has plagued bulgaria for the last three years both major parties claim the government of unaffiliated premier lyuben berov who resigned in september had been controlled by the other
in the last elections in october 1991 the socialists won 106 seats second to udf's 110 neither had a majority in the 240-seat parliament that led to two weak governments unable to push through badly needed reforms
across central and eastern europe one-time communists are on the rise
in a tv appearance saturday night president zhelyu zhelev urged bulgarians to vote in large numbers hinting their support for smaller parties could help break the parliamentary deadlock
nikolai danev a lawyer and udf activist predicted that unless one of the two major parties achieves a clear majority in parliament the result will be early elections in six months or a year at the most
both opposing political blocs said bulgaria's top priority is to combat rampant crime and corruption that threaten to undermine the still shaky democratic system
annual inflation in bulgaria is expected to reach 120 percent by the end of the year some 70 percent of the population of 85 million live on the verge of poverty and about 740000 are jobless
the socialists support market reforms but they plead for a slow transition to avoid hardship for those with low incomes including pensioners and the unemployed
the french-made atr turboprop commuter plane grounded in the united states after a recent crash because of concern about its safety during cold weather may soon be back in service a top us aviation official said sunday
davide hinson the head of the federal aviation administration said he was reasonably optimistic the plane's manufacturer will be able to get the airplane returned to service very soon
the faa grounded the aircraft on dec 9 after tests conducted for the manufacturer suggested the plane was unusually susceptible to loss of control when ice formed on the wings
federal investigators suspect icing may have caused the oct 31 crash of an american eagle atr-72 aircraft in indiana killing all 68 people aboard
hinson appearing on abc's this week with david brinkley said further tests were being conducted and the aircraft could be operating again soon but he did not say whether the faa might impose restrictions on use of the planes in cold weather
nine us regional airlines have about 150 of the atr-72 and the smaller atr-42 turboprop aircraft when the planes were grounded many of the companies shifted to smaller aircraft and canceled flights
the commuter airlines have been the focus of increased attention by air safety regulators in recent weeks after the oct 31 accident and the crash of another american eagle plane a twin-engine 19-seat jetstream dec 13 near morrisville nc
investigators of that crash which killed 15 people are focusing on engine problems and pilot training
hinson and transportation secretary frederico pena both said sunday that the faa has stepped up its inspection of all of the nation's airlines both commuter and larger airlines they also emphasized that they consider it safe to fly
pena rejected criticism that his department which includes the faa has been sluggish in regulating air safety critics have accused the faa of being slow to implement proposed air safety regulations from the national transportation safety board which investigates air crashes
the ntsb for example urged shortly after the oct 31 american eagle crash near roselawn ind that the atr be barred from flying in icy weather conditions although the faa imposed some new operational requirements on the plane it did not ground the aircraft until more than a month later
but pena said the agency was aggressively monitoring the airlines he cited the suspension of 42 daily flights last thursday by kiwi international air lines after the faa raised questions about the carrier's pilot training
hinson a former airline executive said he considers the recent commuter accidents as well as the crash sept 8 near pittsburgh of a usair jetliner that killed 132 people as random events
we find no connection between them whatsoever said hinson he also said there is hardly any statistical difference in the accident rates of the commuters 04 per 100000 departures and the larger airlines 03 per 100000 departures
the faa earlier this month announced it would require commuter airlines to comply with stricter pilot training and operating requirements more in line with requirements already imposed on larger air carriers
pena said that the tougher safety standards for commuter airlines are expected to be issued by the faa within 100 days but some of the final rules may not go into effect until the end of 1995
the american people expect and deserve the highest level of safety in our airline system pena said on cbs' face the nation he added that he also frequently uses commercial air transportation
i fly all over the country with great confidence he said adding that these recent accidents have been troubling
russian troops moved toward the capital of the breakaway republic of chechnya on sunday night in heavy fighting with separatist forces the itar-tass news agency reported
the report of the new russian advance came shortly after chechen leader dzhokhar dudayev told a news conference he would not meet with representatives of president boris yeltsin a meeting yeltsin proposed sunday as a last-ditch effort at a negotiated settlement
the russian troops sent into the caucasus mountain republic a week ago had been dug in outside grozny while moscow gave dudayev until midnight saturday to disarm his forces he refused demanding that russian troops pull out

ivan rybkin speaker of the lower house of russia's parliament recalled a group of deputies from chechnya on sunday night the report said but gave no reason
moscow sent 10000 to 40000 troops into the southern republic to put down an independence drive
yeltsin has staked considerable political capital on resolving the conflict quickly and with minimum casualties the military offensive in the mostly muslim republic of about 12 million people is generally unpopular not only with the public but among russian troops

a pilot of the us helicopter that strayed into north korean airspace was killed in the downing of his aircraft the white house said sunday the second pilot was alive and reportedly uninjured
this tragic loss of life was unnecessary president clinton said in a statement issued by the white house with details of incident still scarce clinton demanded the release of the surviving aviator
north korea said an enemy aircraft was shot down saturday after the oh-58c helicopter wandered across the heavily fortified border the united states said the craft was unarmed and on a routine training mission the incident threatened us-north korea ties less than two months after a breakthrough over pyongyang's nuclear program
the white house statement said chief warrant officer david hilemon of clarksville tenn was killed in the downing of the helicopter the second pilot chief warrant officer bobby hall of brooksville fla is alive and reportedly uninjured the statement said
white house officials said the use of the word downing did not imply the helicopter had been shot down as the north koreans claimed the united states had no independent confirmation of what happened to the craft an administration official said on condition of anonymity
the united states was informed by the north koreans through rep bill richardson d-nm who went to pyongyang on an unrelated mission involving us-north korean nuclear accord
through richardson clinton demanded prompt access to hall
our primary concern now is the welfare of chief warrant officer hall and his return along with the body of chief warrant officer hilemon clinton said
in the statement and in private clinton and his aides carefully chose their words to make sure not to antagonize the north koreans while the second aviator remained in custody
the three-paragraph statement issued shortly after clinton left the white house for a round of golf said richardson would remain in north korea for now and will remain in constant contact with north korean officials on our behalf
it said richardson also was in contact with secretary of state warren christopher
our thoughts and prayers are with the families of both of these dedicated aviators clinton said
defense secretary william perry in a statement also praised hilemon's professionalism and dedication and said the pentagon was working to secure the prompt return of hall and hilemon's body the defense department has launched a full investigation of the circumstances that led to this tragic loss on a routine training flight he said
donna hall wife of the surviving aviator wept when contacted by the associated press at their home in brooksville fla
i'm elated that my husband is safe but my heart goes out to the family of the other man mrs hall said as she cried what she described as tears of joy
us military delegates met with north korean officials sunday at the border village of panmunjom in their first official talks since the unarmed oh-58c helicopter crossed into north korea on saturday
south korean military sources said ground troops saw the helicopter fly into north korean territory but reported no signs of an attack or pursuit the newspaper dong-a ilbo reported
the united states said the helicopter was on a training mission north korean officials accused the united states and south korea of staging hostile air exercises
jim coles a us military spokesman in seoul called those accusations spurious untruths
further meetings were expected command officials said sunday in seoul south korea a white house aide said us officials were in discussions in new york with the north koreans and their main allies the chinese
also sunday richardson met with the north korean foreign minister and the chairman of north korea's legislature the north's official korean central news agency said the report gave no details of the discussions
before word of hilemon's death richardson's spokesman said the congressman had asked to meet with the pilots and offered to extend his stay in hopes of being able to escort them out of north korea
richardson had gone to north korea to discuss the treaty calling for north korea to dismantle its nuclear program the administration enlisted him to devote his visit instead to getting the pilots released
the october signing of the treaty in which north korea promised to dismantle its nuclear reactor and open up its nuclear sites to eventual inspection had marked a sudden improvement in relations between the united states and north korea after months of confrontation over pyongyang's secretive nuclear program the two countries were moving toward establishing low-level diplomatic ties at the time of the helicopter incident
hilemon and hall were both members of a company 4th battalion 501st aviation regiment at camp page in south korea
us helicopters routinely fly in the vicinity of the demilitarized zone but do not enter it on the north korean side
coles the us military spokesman said a navigational mistake could have caused the border crossing noting that a heavy snowfall made landmarks hard to distinguish in the mountainous terrain technical trouble and other mishaps could not be ruled out either he said

with un troops and bosnian serbs trading fire former us president jimmy carter brought his private mission to sarajevo on sunday to seek the elusive end of 32 months of war
carter emerged from his un plane wearing a flak jacket as dusk was falling on the bosnian capital took it off on the tarmac and headeded into the city center down so-called sniper alley which crackled for much of the day with grenade and gunfire
the shooting forced carter's caravan to detour around the most dangerous stretch only several hundred meters yards from bosnian serb frontlines
as carter and his wife rosalyn entered the city french anti-sniper patrols in armored personnel carriers were exchanging fire with the serbs along sniper alley peacekeepers reported a high level of gun and rocket-propelled grenade fire sunday and said three people two french peacekeepers and a civilian were slightly wounded
the former us president met with bosnian president alija izetbegovic and other senior officials and said he would travel to the village of pale bosnian serb headquarters on monday
physical danger was not the only challenge for carter who earlier this year took his brand of free-lance diplomacy to north korea and haiti
parties as diverse as izetbegovic and serbian president slobodan milosevic whose nationalist appeals are widely blamed for starting the bosnian war in 1992 said bosnian serbs may try to use carter's visit to circumvent a peace plan of the so-called contact group composed of the united states russia britain france and germany
carter became involved in bosnia after being contacted by bosnian serb leader radovan karadzic but he said after meeting izetbegovic he would not forge a new plan
there is no other basis for future negotiations except the contact group plan he said
carter said he hoped to contribute to an easing of tensions based on pledges by karadzic to normalize relations with the united nations and then hopefully see some movement toward a comprehensive cease-fire throughout the nation and negotiations based on the contact group's proposals
karadzic promised to end high tension between the united nations and bosnian serbs that followed three nato airstrikes a month ago hundreds of peacekeepers were detained un movements were frozen and the sarajevo airport was closed it reopened with two un flights on saturday
before arriving in sarajevo carter stopped in zagreb croatia for meetings with president franjo tudjman and the bosnian prime minister haris silajdzic
many previous mediation efforts and cease-fires have failed in the bosnian war in which an estimated 200000 people are listed as dead or missing
people on both sides of the frontline were skeptical of carter's mission
jimmy carter asked gojko cvoro a young bosnian serb soldier in pale who's he a former us president who cares
in sarajevo 46-year-old hajrida dzafic said is is a humiliation to to live here and know that those guys are deciding your destiny to feel like their toy
the central issues were emerging in comments made by both sides
bosnian officials insist serbs accept the contact group plan which they repeatedly have rejected it would leave the serbs with 49 percent of bosnia instead of the 70 percent they now hold and grant them no recognition of sovereignty or confederal links with serbia
once they accept the peace plan there are a lot of things we can talk about said silajdzic
that seemed to fit a subtle shift in the contact group approach it was presented as a take-it or leave-it plan this summer but the us representative charles thomas said earlier this month both sides could change anything by mutual consent
karadzic could be tempted to say yes to blunt international criticism but reserve acceptance of any details that would leave the combatants and the international community with agreement on a blank plan no further ahead
there is likely to be disagreement on bosnian serbs' demand for sovereignty which karadzic apparently is seeking as a means to secure his own position as his relations with milosevic deteriorate bosnian serbs are looking at carter's involvement as a way of opening up a direct link to washington their foes' biggest supporter that could be interpreted as de facto recognition
if america so decided the war in bosnia-herzegovina cold be over before new year said aleksa buha the foreign minister of the self-proclaimed bosnian serb state if carter's arrival would make formal the recognition of the bosnian serbs' state then the major part of the work would be done
silajdzic stressed that was unacceptable and added of the carter visit i do not think that this is any kind of international recognition
there was more bad news from the battlefront sunday for the bosnian government
bosnian army officials confirmed reports saturday that the key northwest town of velika kladusa had fallen to weeks of attack by serbs and renegade muslims bosnian army officials in sarajevo said the remaining defenders had managed to pull out
a plo official said sunday that the self-rule government viewed as very grave the shooting of an israeli soldier by a palestinian policeman
the soldier was moderately wounded when the palestinian officer opened fire saturday night at a roadblock in the southern gaza strip he reportedly warned the israelis that he would count to ten when they stopped him at a roadblock
israeli troops returned fire moderately wounding the palestinian policeman whose name was not released the army said
following the incident israel issued a formal complaint and the palestinians apologized and promised to punish the policeman
the shootout followed the severe beating of an israeli reservist by palestinians in the west bank town of ramallah six supporters of the yasser arafat's fatah party were arrested for the attack palestinian sources said
israel television and radio reported that fatah activists published a leaflet in ramallah sunday threatening violence against palestinian photographers involved in recording the soldier's beating such threats by plo-related groups have been rare since the self-rule plan began in the gaza strip and jericho in may
the violence could further undermine arafat's credibility in the eyes of the israeli public and delay the expansion of self-rule in the west bank currently under negotiation
we view this incident as very grave and thank god it ended the way it did with no dead said sufian abu zaide a spokesman for the palestinian authority
abu zaide said the palestinian was a bodyguard and not a member of any official force
i understand that he did what he did out of frustration abu zaide added
israel withdrew forces from gaza in may but maintains troops and roadblocks to protect about 4000 jewish settlers living there
violence between palestinian and israeli troops have been rare the most serious being during july riots at the erez checkpoint in which palestinian forces fatally shot an israeli border policeman
israel radio also reported sunday that the palestinians had increased their police force to 12000 one third more than the number outlined in the autonomy accord
the radio quoted a palestinian commander as saying that the extra forces were in preparation for israeli redeployment in the west bank
while administration officials scoured the federal budget for ways to pay for president clinton's tax-cut plan lawmakers argued sunday over which party is better-equipped to manage the government's books
and neither republican nor democratic legislators seemed to give clinton's middle-income tax cut proposal much of a chance
rep bill archer incoming chairman of the house ways and means committee would only say the president's plan is going to be considered
appearing on nbc's meet the press the texas republican chided clinton for weighing in last with a tax-cut plan he came late to the dance but he's on the dance floor and we welcome that he said
the democratic president stung by a republican landslide in congressional elections in november proposed a tax cut for middle-class americans last week to recapture support for his party
outgoing finance committee chairman sen daniel patrick moynihan said he doubts the republicans will pass a tax cut that is paid for or one that the president will be able to sign
i would think in the end the calculation by the new majority would be why give the president that credit don't give the president a bill he can sign' it will be part of the strategy the new york democrat said on cbs's face the nation
and moynihan said he only reluctantly supports the clinton tax cut proposal
i'll go along because this is support-your-president week if they're paid for moynihan said
clinton's package of tax cuts for families raising children paying tuition or planning for retirement is mostly aimed at households earning less than dlrs 75000 a year
house democrats proposed less-restrictive tax breaks to families earning less than dlrs 75000 by far the priciest plan is the republican proposal to give tax credits for children in families earning less than dlrs 200000
clinton claims he can cut dlrs 72 billion from the federal budget in five years to pay for his dlrs 60 billion program but dlrs 52 billion of the cuts are unspecified and would not take effect until 1999 and 2000
the president who planned to unveil some of the cuts monday has his aides and agency officials reviewing several options
a man suspected in the murders of 11 women in the johannesburg area was shot to death by police on sunday
police col eugene opperman said the suspect who was arrested last week attacked two detectives while showing them places possibly related to the killings

selepe died later in a johannesburg hospital according to opperman's statement the detective hit by the tree limb was treated for minor injuries to his back the statement said
investigations of the so-called cleveland serial killings named for a neighborhood where most of the victims were found as well as selepe's killing would continue opperman said
police believe at least 11 women were strangled sometimes with articles of their clothing by a lone killer the first victim was found july 17 and the last on oct 8
south african police have long been accused of torturing and murdering suspects in detention most of the accusations stem from the apartheid era when police imposed hated discrimination laws and acted against black opposition groups
the nation's first all-race election in april brought a black-led government to power and formally ended apartheid
indian leaders called on the government sunday to order its soldiers back to barracks to prevent clashes with armed rebels in the southern state of chiapas
members of an assembly that is part of a parallel government of protest requested the move one day after 250 indian leaders from around the state met to discuss fears of renewed fighting
the rebel zapatista national liberation army launched a new year's day rebellion in chiapas to gain better treatment of area peasants most of them descendants of mayan indians at least 145 people died in fighting between rebels and government troops before a jan 12 cease-fire was called
the zapatistas have warned that the cease-fire might collapse with the dec 8 inauguration of gov eduardo robledo rincon who they say won the aug 21 election fraudulently
amado avendano figueroa the opposition candidate for governor who says robledo robbed him of victory set up a transition government in rebellion earlier this month with the assembly as its backbone
the government believes that the answer that should be given the chiapan people is to drown them in blood instead of resolving the problems of this region rubicel ruiz gamboa a spokesman for the parallel state assembly said in a statement
we believe that the federal government has the responsibility to halt the authentic threat of war that exists in this region ruiz added
both rebel and governent forces have beefed up defensive measures in recent weeks the zapatistas most of whom are believed to be inside the territory the hold deep in the lacandon jungle estimate that they are now surrounded by some 40000 federal troops
assembly representatives also called on the federal government to recognize their government and appoint a peace envoy with the power to restart peace talks
the assembly also announced a statewide campaign for dec 26-30 to raise support for their parallel government and parallel governments in municipalities around chiapas
several municipalities already have declared their autonomy from the official state government and pledged their allegiance to avendano's organization
assembly members also said the state transition government will launch a constituent assembly on jan 5 to rewrite the state constitution

defender stratos apostolakis converted a first-half penalty kick sunday to give greece a 1-0 victory over scotland in a group 8 european championship qualifying game
the victory before 25000 spectators at the athens olympic stadium continued greece's rebound from a disastrous world cup debut
after losing all three world cup games by a combined score of 10-0 and finishing last of 24 teams greece has won all four of its european qualifying games putting it in a strong position to make the finals in england in 1996
the top two teams in group 8 qualify for the finals
scotland fell to 2-1-1 and five points behind greece in second place finland is in third with six points 2-0-2 with russia fourth 1-1-0

haiti is firmly on the road to democracy but foreign aid must reach the poor soon to satisfy expectations and prevent another exodus of refugees an influential us senator said sunday
democratic sen bob graham of florida who was a key advocate of the us-led intervention that ousted the army regime in september left haiti following a two-day visit it was his first trip to haiti since the elected government was restored oct 15
i am going to report back that we should be enormously proud of what us and other multinational forces have done he said before leaving
but he added foreign aid needs to set in by spring so people don't become restive from not seeing the results of change
the international development bank has identified about dlrs 600 million in short-term needs for haiti the western hemisphere's poorest nation
as soon as haiti pays dlrs 82 million in arrears in interest payments on its foreign debt it will get dlrs 270 million in blocked aid mostly from the world bank and the idb washington has paid about dlrs 25 million in grants to reimburse those arrears
current us aid mostly tied to feeding health and irrigation programs stands at dlrs 200 million a year beginning early next year haiti will get the first of dlrs 200 million in european union grants spread over four years for health agricultural and education projects
but the results of massive infusions of aid won't be tangible until march or april a long delay for impoverished haitians thirsty for relief after three years of devastating sanctions aimed at driving army rulers from power
people must feel they have a future here said graham whose state has long been a destination for haitian refugees if you can create the right circumstances justice and jobs there's a good chance you won't face mass migrations
more than 50000 boat people fled haiti during the army regime that ousted president jean-bertrand aristide in 1991 virtually none have set to sea since aristide's restoration
as un troops and bosnian serbs traded fire former president jimmy carter brought his private peace mission to sarajevo on sunday to seek the elusive end of 32 months of war
carter emerged from his un plane wearing a flak jacket as dusk was falling on the bosnian capital took it off on the tarmac and headed into the city center down the perilous artery called sniper alley which crackled for much of the day with grenade and gunfire
the shooting forced carter's caravan to detour around the most dangerous stretch only several hundred yards from bosnian serb frontlines
as carter and his wife rosalyn entered the city french anti-sniper patrols were exchanging fire with the serbs along sniper alley peacekeepers reported a high level of gun and rocket-propelled grenade fire sunday and said three people two french peacekeepers and a civilian were slightly wounded
carter met with bosnian president alija izetbegovic and other senior officials and said he would travel to bosnian serb headquarters in pale outside sarajevo on sunday
physical danger was not the only challenge for carter who earlier this year took his freelance diplomacy to north korea and haiti but his prospects for success in bosnia are dim
parties as diverse as izetbegovic and serbian president slobodan milosevic whose nationalist appeals are widely blamed for starting the bosnian war in 1992 said bosnian serbs may try to use carter's visit to circumvent a peace plan of the so-called contact group of the united states russia britain france and germany
carter became involved in bosnia after being contacted by bosnian serb leader radovan karadzic but he said after meeting izetbegovic he would not forge a new plan
there is no other basis for future negotiations except the contact group plan he said
carter told reporters at the airport that he hoped to contribute to an easing of tensions based on pledges by karadzic to improve relations with the united nations
karadzic promised to end high tension between the united nations and bosnian serbs that followed three nato airstrikes a month ago hundreds of peacekeepers were detained un movements were frozen and the sarajevo airport was closed it reopened with two un flights on saturday
before arriving in sarajevo carter stopped in zagreb croatia for meetings with president franjo tudjman and the bosnian prime minister haris silajdzic
many previous mediation efforts and cease-fires have failed in the bosnian war in which an estimated 200000 people are listed as dead or missing
people on both sides of the frontline were skeptical of carter's mission
jimmy carter asked gojko cvoro a young bosnian serb soldier in pale who's he a former us president who cares
in sarajevo 46-year-old hajrida dzafic said it is a humiliation to live here and know that those guys are deciding your destiny to feel like their toy
the outline of central issues that carter will take up emerged in comments made by both sides as his visit began
bosnian government officials insisted the serbs accept the peace plan the bosnian government has reluctantly accepted the plan which would leave the serbs with 49 percent of bosnia instead of the 70 percent they now hold
silajdzic said negotiations were possible once the serbs accept the plan once they accept the peace plan there are a lot of things we can talk about he said
that seemed to fit a subtle shift in the contact group approach that emerged earlier this month the plan was presented as non-negotiable this summer but the us representative charles thomas said recently that both sides could change anything they wanted by mutual consent
karadzic might consider agreeing to the framework of the plan to blunt international criticism but reserve acceptance of the details that would leave the combatants and the international community with agreement on a blank plan no further ahead than they are now
there is likely to be continued disagreement on bosnian serbs' demand for sovereignty that has emerged as a key bosnian serb demand in recent weeks
karadzic apparently wants sovereignty to secure his own position as his relations with milosevic deteriorate bosnian serbs see carter's involvement as a way of opening a direct link to washington the bosnian government's biggest supporter that could be interpreted as de facto recognition of their independence
if america so decided the war in bosnia-herzegovina cold be over before new year said aleksa buha foreign minister of the self-proclaimed bosnian serb state if carter's arrival would make formal the recognition of the bosnian serbs' state then the major part of the work would be done
silajdzic stressed that was unacceptable and added of the carter visit i do not think that this is any kind of international recognition
there was more bad news from the battlefront sunday for the bosnian government
bosnian army officials confirmed reports that the key town of velika kladusa in northwest bosnia had fallen after weeks of attack by serbs and renegade muslims bosnian army officials in sarajevo said the remaining defenders had managed to pull out
socialists rode a wave of economic pain and frustration to projected big gains in national elections sunday that gave them a chance to break five years of post-communist gridlock
the election was likely to bring another former communists party back to power in a one-time soviet bloc country but could also break the political paralysis that has prevented this balkan country of 85 million from pursuing consistent economic policies
election monitoring and opinion research institutes gave the socialists between 42-44 percent of the vote far better than the roughly 30 percent projected by pre-election polls
there was an outside possibility that when a distribution formula was applied to the results the socialists could have an absolute majority in the 240-member parliament
zhan videnov the 35-year-old socialist leader exulted that the results were a victory not only for an individual party but for the whole country
he said voters had punished his foe the union of democratic forces or udf for its unproductive confrontational policy its lack of competence irresponsibility
the projections based on samples from about 2 percent of more than 12000 polling stations gave udf between 23-25 percent the mainly turkish movement for rights and freedoms had up to 65 percent
two other small alliances appeared to clear the 4 percent vote hurdle to gain representation
they were the popular union made up of the democratic party that split from the udf and an agrarian party with 55-65 percent and the bulgarian business bloc with 45-5 percent if another coalition the democratic alliance for the republic failed to clear the 4 percent hurdle the socialists could end up with an absolute majority
udf leader filip dimitrov's unwillingness to compromise not only has caused splits in his own movement but apparently alienated voters
the result has shown that for many bulgarians udf and democracy are identical with all that has happened in the last five years he said
that post-communist experience has not been good for many bulgarians
annual inflation is expected to reach 120 percent by the end of the year some 70 percent of the population ive on the verge of poverty and about 740000 are jobless
the socialists support market reforms but they plead for a slow transition to avoid hardship for those with low incomes including pensioners and the unemployed
in the last elections in october 1991 the socialists won 106 seats second to udf's 110 neither had a majority leading to two weak governments unable to push through badly needed reforms
in a tv appearance saturday night president zhelyu zhelev urged bulgarians to vote in large numbers hinting their support for smaller parties could help break the parliamentary deadlock
that raised some questions about the president's impartiality and videnov asserted zhelev had violated the election law banning canvassing 24 hours before the polls open
some of the voters were pessimistic about the future following years of government crises and parliamentary stalemate
i am very disappointed i have almost no hope after all that happened in the last few years in this country said marina sapundzhieva a clerk in her mid 40s
peter nedyalkov a 21-year-old auto mechanic said i'm not going to vote i do not trust the politicians all of them are lying
both opposing political blocs said bulgaria's top priority is to combat rampant crime and corruption that threaten to undermine the still shaky democratic system
on thursday interim prime minister reneta indzhova said organized crime in bulgaria had entered all levels of the state the justic system tolerates favors and perfects the form of economic and common crime she said
investigators held out little hope sunday of capturing whoever fired a gun at least four times at the white house piercing a state dining room window with one shot
the secret service confirmed that one 9mm bullet was found late saturday in the state dining room one floor below the president's residence other bullets were found on the landing of a first-floor balcony a driveway outside the back door and a nearby christmas tree
president clinton and his family were sleeping in their top-floor residence during the shooting early saturday and were never in danger the secret service said
but the late discovery of a bullet inside the mansion made the third white house security breach this year especially disturbing a suspect who peppered the white house with bullets in october managed to hit a press room window in the west wing
although some white house windows are not bulletproof the president is not at risk if a bullet is fired at a window law enforcement officials said speaking on condition of anonymity they said bulletproof panels are wheeled in front of the windows when the president or other dignitaries are in the room
the state dining room was not in use during the early-morning shooting
the president attended church sunday with his family then headed out for a round of golf seemingly unfazed by the weekend's events
with their crime scene search completed investigators said sunday they believed all bullets on the white house grounds had been found secret service agents reported hearing just four shots although other witnesses said they heard six
a preliminary ballistics examination found that all the bullets came from the same weapon according to a secret service statement additional tests to determine the type of weapon were to be conducted monday
nine-millimeter ammunition can be fired from handguns shoulder-strap weapons and some rifles the distance a bullet can travel depends on the type of weapon used
the bullets found saturday were in good condition indicating that they were fired from a great distance and had not struck with enough force to be greatly disfigured the dining room bullet pierced the glass and just fell near the window plop one official said on condition of anonymity
that could suggest the white house was not the target several officials including chief of staff leon panetta speculated that the incident was a drive-by shooting in a city besieged by gun violence
a public street loops behind the white house grounds less than 100 yards meters from where the bullets were found
but investigators also noted that the bullets were found within a few hundred feet about 100 meters of each other suggesting the gunman took aim at the white house
bullets found outdoors in a christmas tree adjacent to the diplomatic entrance and on a nearby driveway struck places where clinton routinely walks ironically the dining room window stuck by one bullet offers the best view over the site a few feet meters below of a september plane crash at the white house
investigators said there were few clues in the case and no description of a suspect
if somebody out there starts bragging maybe we'll get somebody said one law enforcement official right now we have nothing to go on
less than two months ago a gunman sprayed the front of the white house with semiautomatic weapon fire while clinton was upstairs watching tv a 26-year-old colorado man francisco martin duran has been charged with attempted assassination in that incident and is awaiting trial officials say there was no connection between the two shootings
in september a small plane crashed-landed on the south grounds of the white house and its pilot was killed
rubber-faced comic jim carrey's latest motion picture dumb and dumber debuted this weekend at the top of the box office with an estimated take of dlrs 162 million preliminary figures showed sunday

the figures are based on industry estimates of ticket sales friday through sunday final box office figures will be released monday
domingos oliveira scored twice in the first 11 minutes to spark an 8-0 rout over liechenstein and move portugal to the top of group 6 in european championship qualifying
it was the fourth victory in as many games for portugal which until sunday hadn't scored more than three goals in a qualifying game this year
liechtenstein which missed a penalty sunday fell to 0-0-5 having been outscored 21-1
domingos started the rout by stripping a liechtenstein defender dishing off to joao silva then cutting to the net for the return pass and the score
nine minutes later and it was domingos again unloading from 30 meters and finding the right corner over goalkeeper martin heeb
portugal appeared content to protect the 2-0 lead but their midfield dominated play and rarely allowed liechtenstein to move the ball downfield
domingos set up a third a minute before half sending a cross into oceano cruz who knocked in a right-footer
portugal used pressure to score five more in the opening 20 minutes of the second half
joao pinto intercepted an upfield pass and blasted it from 40 meters to score in the 54th before fernando couto antonio folha and paulo alves all added goals in three minutes to make the score 7-0 by the 63rd
alves added a second in the 65th minute skipping a 10 meter shot past heeb

wearing a flak jacket former us president jimmy carter came to sarajevo on sunday seeking what has frustrated every other international mediator an end to bosnia's war
carter emerged from his un plane just as dusk was falling on the bosnian capital and headed along so-called sniper alley in the city center which crackled with rocket-propelled grenades and gunfire much of the day two french peacekeepers and a civilian were slightly wounded according to peacekeepers
just before carter and his wife rosalyn entered the city french anti-sniper patrols in armored personnel carriers exchanged fire with the serbs
carter's caravan detoured around the most dangerous stretch of the avenue which lies just several hundred meters yards from the bosnian serbs' frontline police were posted at hundred-meter yard intervals
carter headed to the bosnian presidency building in heart of the city for a meeting with bosnian president alija izetbegovic and other senior officials he was expected to travel to the village of pale bosnian serb headquarters on monday
physical danger was not the only challenge for carter who earlier this year served as a free-lance diplomat to north korea and haiti there was widespread skepticism that he could bridge the differences between bosnian serbs and the muslim-led government

vreni schneider of switzerland captured her 53rd world cup career victory and her first ever under the lights in a night women's slalom at sestriere sunday
the 30-year-old swiss veteran skier the defending world cup champion clocked an unbeatable combined time of one minute 3855 seconds down the demanding kandahar course beating swedish runnerup pernilla wiberg by 087 seconds
france's beatrice filliol cq capitalized on a fast second run to finish third in 13974 minutes
austrian teenager sabine egger edged new zealander annelise coberger by one hundredth of a second for fourth place
schneider a three-time olympic and world champion was the fastest in the first run in 4768 seconds and added 5087 seconds or the fifth best time in the second heat
the swiss ace who scored her second consecutive slalom triumph this season is going after a world cup all-time record of 62 wins held by retired austrian ski queen annemarie moser-proell
sunday's slalom which had 60 and 61 gates in the two runs was the first ever women's world cup race held under floodlight
schneider who is competing in her 11th world cup season after overcoming several back and leg injuries said she enjoyed the nighttime event
my experience did not count tonight as it was a first for all of us schneider my slalom form is impressive what counts most for me is to stay in good health
i hope that a lot of snow comes soon this would be the best christmas gift for me schneider said
lack of snow in most alpine resorts has disrupted the men's program and forced rescheduling of some women's events
schneider could add another win in the next world cup race a giant slalom scheduled at val badia in northeast italy wednesday
this race is expected to mark the comeback of olympic champion deborah compagnoni sidelined by a kidney infection for nine consecutive world cup races
swiss heidi zeller-baehler retained the overall lead in the world cup standings with 445 points although she did not start in sunday's race
slalom is zeller-baehler weakest discipline
schneider the olympic slalom champion at lillehammer last february climbed to second place overall with 357 points
katja seizinger of germany a specialist of speed races fell from second to third place despite a 19th place in slalom which improved her total points to 341 wiberg moved into fifth place with 300
the swedish skier said she would like to race also super-g and giant slalom races under lights
i understand it would be expensive to have lights along courses longer than slaloms but it would be a terrific improvement for this sport wiberg said
about schneider's domination in slaloms wiberg said i hope she is not unbeatable
she is very strong very experienced it will be difficult to beat her but i'll try
eva twardokens was the best us first-run finisher in 36th place 304 seconds slower than schneider
slovenian rising star katja koren second in the first run fell in the second after clocking the fastest split time

former us president jimmy carter invited to make peace where others failed met a strained and skeptical sarajevo on sunday that didn't even pause in the shooting to note his good intentions
there was no gas to heat and little food to cook but plenty of exploding rocket-propelled grenades and the rattle of machine guns that added three more people to the long list of wounded in 32 months of war
carter was invited to bosnia by bosnian serb leader radovan karadzic who promised wednesday to stop the shooting in and around sarajevo and to reopen the city's airport to peacekeeping flights as part of a broad improvement in relations with the united nations
all those promises made to him are just empty promises said bosnian vice president ejup ganic

skeptical residents of the dobrinja district nearest the airport have often looked on as diplomatic convoys of vips passed along the streets sunday was no different
it is a humiliation to live here and know that those guys are deciding your destiny to feel like their toy said hajrida dzafic 46 a dobrinja resident
sarajevo residents noted carter did not have the force of the us government behind him and were skeptical he could do much to change the situation
i didn't see thousands of marines behind him i only saw his wife said vlado staka one of the few local journalists permitted to meet carter and his wife roselyn at the airport
in the bosnian serb headquarters town of pale east of sarajevo skepticism was just as strong
can he give us assurances that we would be an independent recognized state of course he can't so what will he do here

russia warned them to leave grozny before fighting became too fierce but for one group of civilians the terror came on the road
drunken russian soldiers in tanks cut them off opened fire and crushed their cars then hunted down the wounded as they tried to flee witnesses and officials said
nine people were believed killed but there were no bodies left at the scene to verify that
the scene of saturday's carnage in the village of nesterovskaya about 30 miles of the chechen capital of grozny testified to the violence
blood-covered footprints led from three crushed cars to bushes along the road and the ground was littered with spent cartridges from a machine gun women's clothes lay nearby a half-eaten loaf of bread lay on the rear window of one car
one investigator said a child's footprints appeared to be next to a woman's
according to the traces they chased and killed the wounded then dragged them away said an ingush investigator at the scene who did not give his name
the killings underscored the breakdown in discipline in the russian military some russian soldiers have said they will defy orders to advance on chechnya where moscow is trying to crush an independence movement and reassert authority morale in the armed forces is low and the defense minister pavel grachev is unpopular
the commanders had orders to let the refugees pass but these cars were fired upon and squashed said khamzat bekov emergency situations minister in the neighboring republic of ingushetia where the refugees were headed then they tried to conceal all the traces we cannot find the bodies the wounded
officials blamed interior ministry troops who patrol roads and guard the rear flank of the army
i travel around and all i see is drunken soldiers and drunken officers manning the posts said lt gen valery vostrotin russia's deputy emergency situations minister they have no discipline and they go unpunished
witnesses and investigators had different theories on what may have prompted the attack
one is that the soldiers attacked the refugees to avenge the death of a russian soldier in an attack earlier saturday by chechen fighters

moscow sent 10000 to 40000 troops into the southern republic to reassert its authority chechnya declared independence in 1991
yeltsin has staked considerable political capital on resolving the conflict quickly and with minimum casualties the military offensive in the mostly muslim republic of about 12 million people is generally unpopular not only with the public but among russian troops
the russian government has said it would use force humanely and urged women children and non-combatants to leave grozny an estimated 67000 to 100000 refugees have fled to neighboring ingushetia

the self-rule government considers the shooting of an israeli soldier by a paletinian policeman very grave a plo official said sunday
the soldier was moderately wounded when the palestinian officer opened fire saturday night at a roadblock in the southern gaza strip he reportedly warned the israelis that he would count to ten when they stopped him at a roadblock
israeli troops returned fire moderately wounding the palestinian policeman whose name was not released the army said
following the incident israel issued a formal complaint and the palestinians apologized and promised to punish the policeman
the shootout followed the severe beating of an israeli reservist by palestinians in the west bank town of ramallah six supporters of the yasser arafat's fatah party were arrested for the attack palestinian sources said
israel television and radio reported that fatah activists issued a leaflet in ramallah sunday threatening palestinian photographers who recorded the soldier's beating such threats by plo-related groups have been rare since self-rule began in the gaza strip and the west bank town of jericho in may
the violence could further undermine arafat's credibility in the eyes of the israeli public and delay the expansion of self-rule in the west bank currently under negotiation
we view this incident as very grave and thank god it ended the way it did with no dead said sufian abu zaide a spokesman for the palestinian authority
abu zaide said the palestinian was a bodyguard and not a member of any official force
i understand that he did what he did out of frustration abu zaide added
the joint palestinian-israeli security committee was to meet sunday to further investigate the incident
israel withdrew from the gaza in may but maintains troops and roadblocks to protect about 4000 jewish settlers living there
violent confrontations between palestinian and israeli troops have been rare the most serious were riots in july at the erez checkpoint in which an israeli border policeman was shot dead by palestinian forces
israel radio also reported sunday that the palestinians had increased their police force to 12000 one third more than the number outlined in the autonomy accord
the radio quoted a palestinian commander as saying that the extra forces were in preparation for israeli redeployment in the west bank

how can we save ourselves one woman told associated press television near a demolished car if our legs can take us out of here we go if not they crush us
it is unclear how many people have been killed in the week-long russian offensive unconfirmed reports say hundreds of civilians may be dead and at least 17 russian soldiers news agencies said at least two russian soldiers were killed sunday
some soldiers have vowed not to advance even if ordered it was not clear whether any refused sunday night one commander was recalled saturday after promising villagers his tanks would not storm grozny
reformist lawmaker yegor gaidar an opponent of the military operation held a news conference sunday to urge russians to protest in the streets
the main thing we can do today is to organize a mass protest which would force the authorities the president to understand what kind of tragic madness they are being pushed into said gaidar usually a yeltsin ally
but yeltsin was supported by eduard shevardnadze leader of the former soviet republic of georgia which borders chechnya on the south itar-tass quoted shevardnadze as saying russia must be unified and stable and therefore must stop aggressive separatism

i didn't see thousands of marines behind him i only saw his wife said vlado staka one of the few local journalists permitted to meet carter and his wife rosalyn at the airport
in the town of pale where carter is to visit bosnian serb headquarters on monday skepticism was just as strong
the early projections were said to be based on samples from about 2 percent of votes counted at more than 12000 polling stations
the three groups making the early forecast were the local gallup international affiliate the bulgarian association for free elections and the civic initiative for free and democratic elections
pre-election opinion polls had given the socialists 30 percent and the union of democratic forces 20 percent

nikolai danev a lawyer and udf activist predicted that unless one of the two major parties achieves a clear majority in parliament the result will be early elections in six months or a year at the most
the two major parties appear to agree on only one thing the need to combat rampant crime and corruption which threaten to undermine the still shaky democratic system
police statistics say that corruption has cost the country an estimated 118 billion leva dlrs 180 million this year

former president jimmy carter invited to make peace where others failed met a strained and skeptical sarajevo on sunday that didn't even pause in its shooting to note his good intentions
there was no gas to heat and little food to cook but plenty of exploding rocket-propelled grenades and the rattle of machine guns that added three more people to the list of the wounded in 32 months of war
carter was invited to bosnia by serb leader radovan karadzic who promised wednesday to stop the shooting in and around sarajevo and to reopen the city's airport to peacekeeping flights

a pilot of the us helicopter that strayed into north korean airspace was killed in the downing of his aircraft the white house said sunday the second pilot was alive and reportedly uninjured
this tragic loss of life was unnecessary president clinton said in a statement issued by the white house with details of incident still scarce clinton demanded the release of the surviving aviator
north korea said an enemy aircraft was shot down saturday after the oh-58c helicopter wandered across the heavily fortified border the united states said the craft was unarmed and on a routine training mission the incident threatened us-north korea ties less than two months after a breakthrough over pyongyang's nuclear program
the white house statement said chief warrant officer david hilemon of clarksville tenn was killed in the downing of the helicopter the second pilot chief warrant officer bobby hall of brooksville fla is alive and reportedly uninjured the statement said
white house officials said the use of the word downing did not imply the helicopter had been shot down as the north koreans claimed the united states had no independent confirmation of what happened to the craft an administration official said on condition of anonymity
the united states was informed by the north koreans through rep bill richardson d-nm who went to pyongyang on an unrelated mission involving us-north korean nuclear accord
through richardson clinton demanded prompt access to hall
our primary concern now is the welfare of chief warrant officer hall and his return along with the body of chief warrant officer hilemon clinton said
in the statement and in private clinton and his aides carefully chose their words to make sure not to antagonize the north koreans while the second aviator remained in custody
the three-paragraph statement issued shortly after clinton left the white house for a round of golf said richardson would remain in north korea for now and will remain in constant contact with north korean officials on our behalf
it said richardson also was in contact with secretary of state warren christopher
our thoughts and prayers are with the families of both of these dedicated aviators clinton said
james woolsey director of the central intelligence agency said in a cable news network interview the cia had no indication at this point that the north korean military had reacted to the helicopter incident by going on alert or initiating troop movements
defense secretary william perry in a statement praised hilemon's professionalism and dedication and said the pentagon was working to secure the prompt return of hall and hilemon's body the defense department has launched a full investigation of the circumstances that led to this tragic loss on a routine training flight he said
donna hall wife of the surviving aviator wept when contacted by the associated press at their home in brooksville fla
i'm elated that my husband is safe but my heart goes out to the family of the other man mrs hall said as she cried what she described as tears of joy
us military delegates met with north korean officials sunday at the border village of panmunjom in their first official talks since the unarmed oh-58c helicopter crossed into north korea on saturday
south korean military sources said ground troops saw the helicopter fly into north korean territory but reported no signs of an attack or pursuit the newspaper dong-a ilbo reported
the united states said the helicopter was on a training mission north korean officials accused the united states and south korea of staging hostile air exercises
jim coles a us military spokesman in seoul called those accusations spurious untruths
further meetings were expected command officials said sunday in seoul south korea a white house aide said us officials were in discussions in new york with the north koreans and their main allies the chinese
also sunday richardson met with the north korean foreign minister and the chairman of north korea's legislature the north's official korean central news agency said the report gave no details of the discussions

what is there to be scared of said 25-year-old khaza khutoyeva as she peddled russian champagne and american cigarettes i'm not scared at all
moscow sent an estimated 10000 to 40000 troops on dec 12 into chechnya in the caucasus mountains of southern russia to reestablish its authority the republic declared independence in 1991
yeltsin has staked considerable political capital on resolving the conflict quickly and with minimal casualties the offensive in the mostly muslim republic of about 12 million people is generally unpopular in russia
former prime minister yegor gaidar on sunday called for russians to take to the streets to protest the chechen campaign
the main thing we can do today is to organize a mass protest which would force the executive authorities force the president to understand what kind of tragic madness they are being pushed into said gaidar leader of the reformist russia's choice party which generally supports yeltsin
yeltsin was supported by eduard shevardnadze leader of the former soviet republic of georgia which borders chechnya on the south itar-tass quoted shevardnadze as saying it is important for russia to remain unified and stable and therefore russia must stop aggressive separatism
some russian soldiers had vowed not to advance on grozny even if it meant disobeying direct orders it was not clear if any did so sunday
the russian government urged women children and non-combatants to leave grozny state-run ostankino tv said sunday that 67000 refugees had fled to the neighboring republic of ingushetia
members of the russian parliament flew into ingushetia to appeal to the military not to attack civilians
yet as an 11-car convoy of refugees from grozny headed toward ingushetia on saturday russian tanks cut off the last three cars near the village of nesterovskaya
the tanks advancing across snow-covered fields opened fire and continued firing as refugees jumped from the cars and ran away then a tank smashed the three cars on the muddy road
the commanders had orders to let the refugees pass but these cars were fired upon and squashed said khamzat bekov ingushetia's emergency situations minister then they tried to conceal all the traces we cannot find the bodies the wounded
how can we save ourselves one woman told associated press television as she stood near one of the demolished cars if our legs can take us out of here we go if not they crush us
russian planes bombed an airfield as well as armored vehicles southeast of grozny on sunday morning interfax also reported a rocket attack on pervomaiskoye northeast of grozny and khankala an eastern suburb
it is unclear how many people have been killed in the week-long russian offensive the chechen side has not reported casualties unconfirmed reports say hundreds of civilians may be dead and at least 17 russian soldiers news agencies said at least two russian soldiers were killed sunday
the french-made atr turboprop commuter plane grounded in the united states after a recent crash because of concern about its safety during cold weather may soon be back in service a top us aviation official said sunday
david hinson the head of the federal aviation administration said he was reasonably optimistic the plane's manufacturer will be able to get the airplane returned to service very soon
the faa barred the aircraft from flying in icy conditions on dec 9 after tests conducted for the manufacturer suggested the plane was unusually susceptible to loss of control when ice formed on the wings
federal investigators suspect icing may have caused the oct 31 crash of an american eagle atr-72 aircraft in indiana killing all 68 people aboard
hinson appearing on abc's this week with david brinkley said further tests were being conducted and the aircraft could be operating again soon but he did not say whether the faa might impose restrictions on use of the planes in cold weather
nine us regional airlines have about 150 of the atr-72 and the smaller atr-42 turboprop aircraft when the planes were grounded many of the companies shifted to smaller aircraft and canceled flights
the commuter airlines have been the focus of increased attention by air safety regulators in recent weeks after the oct 31 accident and the crash of another american eagle plane a twin-engine 19-seat jetstream dec 13 near morrisville nc
investigators of that crash which killed 15 people are focusing on engine problems and pilot training
hinson and transportation secretary frederico pena both said sunday that the faa has stepped up its inspection of all of the nation's airlines both commuter and larger airlines they also emphasized that they consider it safe to fly
pena rejected criticism that his department which includes the faa has been sluggish in regulating air safety critics have accused the faa of being slow to implement proposed air safety regulations from the national transportation safety board which investigates air crashes
the ntsb for example urged shortly after the oct 31 american eagle crash near roselawn ind that the atr be barred from flying in icy weather conditions although the faa imposed some new operational requirements on the plane it did not ground the aircraft until more than a month later
but pena said the agency was aggressively monitoring the airlines he cited the suspension of 42 daily flights last thursday by kiwi international air lines after the faa raised questions about the carrier's pilot training
hinson a former airline executive said he considers the recent commuter accidents as well as the crash sept 8 near pittsburgh of a usair jetliner that killed 132 people as random events
we find no connection between them whatsoever said hinson he also said there is hardly any statistical difference in the accident rates of the commuters 04 per 100000 departures and the larger airlines 03 per 100000 departures
the faa earlier this month announced it would require commuter airlines to comply with stricter pilot training and operating requirements more in line with requirements already imposed on larger air carriers
pena said that the tougher safety standards for commuter airlines are expected to be issued by the faa within 100 days but some of the final rules may not go into effect until the end of 1995
the american people expect and deserve the highest level of safety in our airline system pena said on cbs' face the nation he added that he also frequently uses commercial air transportation
i fly all over the country with great confidence he said adding that these recent accidents have been troubling
santa claus patrick landeza sometimes totes a ukulele to his throne and has been known to thrill filipino children by wishing them a merry christmas in tagalog
santa claus willie edward brown jr has a gift for rap
then there's the spanish-speaking santa's helper the bilingual coloring books and the signing santa too for those who need extra help communicating with the jolly jelly-bellied fellow
no doubt about it at this suburban san francisco area mall as at other north pole outposts across the country the leader of the reindeer pack is keeping pace with the changing face of america
the whole santa thing has changed dramatically says jenny zink who helps train st nick's stand-ins for walnut creek-based western temporary services a santa placement agency
once almost exclusively the preserve of older white men often retirees looking for a little holiday pin money santas nowadays span a much wider spectrum they can be young black hispanic asian bilingual even female
it just makes sense santa is a child's imagination and if 25 percent of your customers are hispanic and 25 percent are african-american you want to find a santa that fits what your customer is said elizabeth pedersen-knapp marketing manager of the southland mall in hayward where landeza and brown do santa duty
although santa is an equal opportunity employer knapp and others say they don't go out seeking applicants of a particular ethnicity they're more concerned about whether the applicant is jovial likes children and can withstand four hours of dealing with youngsters who may be bashful boisterous or bawling
everything else is secondary especially to the children knapp said the single most important thing is that he means love and he means happiness
landeza agreed the kids only see santa once a year so it better be a good one
on a recent evening at southland mall landeza did a brisk trade in candy canes booming out a cheery ho ho ho as he took requests from children
the asian face behind the traditional flowing white beard and grandpa glasses didn't seem to bother any of the children and drew little response from the somewhat harried parents standing in line other than a casual oh cool
brown said the first year he played santa he got a few comments from children who told him santa's not black but that hasn't happened this year
if the santa has a good attitude they're happy said brown by day an electrician and aspiring rap artist
in fact non-nordic santas may not be such a break with tradition as popularly supposed st nicholas one of many ancestors in the santa family tree arrived in the netherlands from what is now turkey
zink who has been training santas for two decades said she has occasionally found parents less than accepting of a nonwhite santa and that to me is sad
but children don't seem to have a problem with it they do see santa in their own eyes she said
santa's look isn't the only thing that has changed
zink said she trains santas not to talk about mommy and daddy in deference to the fact that today's children may not be living with both or either
they also never promise to deliver
santa will always see what he can do zink said
landeza a 22-year-old college student has experienced the occupational hazards common to all santas he's memorized barbie in all her incarnations learned to charm recalcitrant visitors sometimes with a quick harmonica solo and gotten sprinkled on by an incontinent infant
a self-described hawaiian filipino chinese irish spanish gaumian he's had few queries from children skeptical about his christmas credentials
if he does he's generally got a comeback
i had one kid saying santa's not chinese' and i said you're right santa is not chinese he's hawaiian'

former us president jimmy carter arrived in the bosnian capital sunday to try what others have failed to do end 32 months of war in bosnia
carter launched his peace mission as government troops withdrew from a key northwest bosnian town velika kladusa that had been under attack for weeks by serbs and renegade muslims
bosnian army officials in sarajevo said defenders had managed to pull out of the surrounded town and that there were no civilians loyal to the government left there
before flying to sarajevo carter stopped briefly in frankfurt and the croatian capital zagreb where he met with croatian president franjo tudjman and bosnian prime minister haris silajdzic
cater landed at sarajevo's airport at 423 pm 1523 gmt just as darkness was descending and emerged from his plane wearing a flak jacket
sunday morning four rocket-propelled grenades hit the center of sarajevo two hit close to a french un anti-sniping team slightly wounding a peacekeeper and a civilian two more hit a nearby barracks of ukrainian peacekeepers
security was tight with police posted every 100 meters yards along the route in to the city from the airport
after meeting silajdzic carter told reporters that he would meet bosnian president alija izetbegovic in sarajevo and observe very carefully whether bosnian serbs were making good on promises to ease tensions
he was likely to go on to pale the bosnian serb headquarters just outside of sarajevo on monday
bosnian serb leader radovan karadzic invited carter to help restart peace talks carter successfully broke diplomatic stalemates this year in haiti and north korea
but a wide spectrum of officials expressed concern that karadzic would try to use carter's visit to undermine efforts to get the serbs to accept an international peace plan
the serbs have rejected the plan which would force them to pare their holdings of bosnian territory to 49 percent from the 70 percent it now holds the bosnian government has accepted the plan
bosnian leaders serbia's powerful leader slobodan milosevic and russia a traditional serbian ally have expressed concern over the visit
a statement from the carter center in atlanta said carter decided to make the trip after extensive discussions with the white house and un officials
my purpose in traveling to the region is to seek ways to contribute to the cessation of hostilities and to encourage the acceptance of the contact group's plan as the basis for negotiations he said
the so-called contact group britain france germany russia and the united states has been pushing the peace plan since the summer
to lure carter to bosnia karadzic pledged wednesday to ease tension with the united nations his serbs had virtually shut down the un operation halting convoys through serb territory and taking hundreds of peacekeepers hostage in response to nato airstrikes last month
the serbs allowed two un flights to land saturday at sarajevo's airport which had been closed since nov 21 after serbs positioned anti-aircraft missiles nearby sources said one plane carried an advance team for carter
but the serbs blocked three flights earlier saturday and set new conditions for resuming the humanitarian airlift
the serbs want to bar bosnian citizens from united nations flights un sources said they also want bosnian serbs to be able to fly to serbia proper there have been no regular flights to serbia from sarajevo
the serbs are also requiring the united nations to get permission for each flight it wants to land said a un spokesman speaking on condition of anonymity before the airport was closed un officials only had to notify serbs about their flight plans 24 hours in advance not seek permission
former president jimmy carter arrived in sarajevo on sunday to try his hand at ending a 32-month war that has frustrated countless other mediators
carter's plane landed at sarajevo's airport late sunday afternoon as dusk fell he emerged from the plane wearing a flak jacket
he undertook his trip as government troops abandoned a key northwest bosnian town velika kladusa that had been under attack for weeks by serbs and renegade muslims bosnian army officials said no civilians loyal to the government were left there
four rocket-propelled grenades hit the center of sarajevo the bosnian capital on sunday morning wounding a un peacekeeper and a civilian
carter stopped briefly in frankfurt and the croatian capital zagreb where he met with that republic's president franjo tudjman and bosnian prime minister haris silajdzic before leaving for sarajevo on sunday afternoon
security in sarajevo was tight with police posted every 100 yards along the route from the airport to the city
after meeting silajdzic carter told reporters that he would meet bosnian president alija izetbegovic in sarajevo and observe very carefully whether bosnian serbs were making good on promises to ease tensions
he was likely to go to pale the bosnian serb headquarters just outside of sarajevo on monday
in frankfurt carter met with us ambassador charles redman the former special us envoy on the yugoslav conflict and redman's successor charles thomas
asked by reporters in frankfurt if there would be peace in bosnia before christmas carter said i hope so but i don't know
bosnian serb leader radovan karadzic invited carter to help restart peace talks
but the visit is raising concern from all sides that karadzic is using carter to undermine an international peace plan that would reduce serb territory in bosnia to 49 percent from the 70 percent it now holds the serbs have rejected the plan which was drawn up by the contact group representing the united states russia germany britain and france
carter said however that he wanted to seek ways to contribute to the cessation of hostilities and to encourage the acceptance of the contact group's plan as the basis for negotiations
growing debts and organizational disarray have damaged the african national congress' ability to govern south africa its secretary general said sunday
cyril ramaphosa described the former revolutionary movement that won the nation's first all-race election in april as riddled with problems in a report to the anc's first national conference since taking power
the almost 3000 delegates applauded ramaphosa's stinging description of the anc as a rudderless debt-ridden organization with dwindling influence in the government it heads
he called the anc too dependent on the personal power of nelson mandela its president and the nation's first black president and struggling to maintain any kind of equilibrium since winning more than 62 percent of the april vote
the conference was expected to address complaints by supporters that mandela's government has been too accommodating to the white minority since taking power and failed to address the needs of the impoverished black majority
mandela defended the government in his opening address saturday but acknowledged some mistakes had been made and pledged tangible benefits for blacks in 1995
despite the criticisms of mandela's government he remains by far the country's most popular leader with various opinion polls showing his support has increased since his inauguration in may
but labor groups emboldened by the end of white rule have waged a series of protests and strikes raising fears of economic instability as mandela pushes for increased foreign investment
ramaphosa a former union leader who led anc negotiators in years of talks with former white leaders on ending apartheid said the anc had failed to properly prepare as an organization for the shift from opposition movement to governing party
with scores of officials moving into government positions the party promoted middle-level officials to senior positions but has failed to fill the resulting gaps ramaphosa said
little fiscal discipline exists with mandela serving as the only reliable money-raising tool he added
we do have financial difficulties we are still addressing the problems of the massive debt we have incurred after the elections said ramaphosa who gave no figures for the amount of money owed
he said the anc would study ways to raise more money from its members instead of trying to tap disappearing outside sources
ramaphosa rejected talk of grassroots unhappiness with the anc and government saying people supported mandela's government in its bid to promote reconciliation between blacks and whites after apartheid
the purpose of the conference he said was to work out strategies for continuing with reconciliation while at the same time addressing the needs of the black majority
also sunday the black nationalist pan africanist congress reelected clarence makwetu as its leader despite the group's poor showing in the april vote
the pac which calls for black majority rule and taking land from whites barely managed to gain a few seats in parliament and party hardliners criticized makwetu's leadership but delegates to a party conference gave makwetu a slim victory in voting for the pac presidency
while virtually powerless in the new government the pac represents a militant ideology attractive to young blacks and could benefit if the anc fails to deliver promised benefits to blacks
his solemn face stared from a tabloid newspaper which announced sunday now all britain can share in his joy
after a week of press pursuit court injunctions and public debate about personal privacy and the woes of winning a fortune three newspapers on sunday identified the man who scooped nearly 179 million pounds dlrs 2789 million and turned the new national lottery into a national issue
the 41-year-old immigrant factory worker at the center of fleet street's best rags-to-riches story yet has reportedly taken off with his wife and three young sons for an indefinite holiday in the family's native india
meanwhile ticket sales in the national lottery started at the beginning of november are booming
at a supermarket checkout a flustered clerk joked to waiting shoppers she might not be there be next week on radio and television chat shows politicians join in musings about what it would be like to win a fortune
some churchmen complain that the amount of the big jackpot was obsence a life-ruiner for ordinary people millions of ordinary people dream on and try again in the one pound dlrs 156 a ticket weekly draw
sixty million tickets were sold more than one for every man woman and child in britain in the nov 19 draw won by the factory worker identified sunday as mukhtar mohidin
he was the first single player to sweep the jackpot which was doubled up because no one had won the week before
in saturday night's draw two people hit the winning six-number sequence and had to settle for 34 million pounds dlrs 53 million each
mohidin asked for privacy the tabloids set about out finding him and within 36 hours had reporters and photographers camped outside his 50000-pound dlrs 78000 house in blackburn a nondescript northern industrial town
mid-week five newspapers appealed successfully on grounds of freedom of speech against a high court injunction obtained by the lottery organizers camelot banning publication of his identity license rules say camelot must protect winners who want privacy
until sunday newspapers held back from publishing the winner's name
but there was everything else pictures of the street where he lived reports that he was overwhelmed wished he had not won and was receiving counselling that his local mosque had turned down his attempt to donate 1 million pounds dlrs 156 because muslims are not allowed to gamble
it is totally unrealistic for anyone to think that the identity of the winner of almost 18 million pounds can be kept secret news of the world editor piers morgan said sunday
the strait-laced sunday telegraph agreed sooner or later the neighbors are going to notice the rolls-royce or the private yacht it commented
mohidin's neighbors noticed he vanished right after the draw at work he failed to show up his wife went absent from her job in a clothing factory he also confided in relatives and word raced round the local muslim community
newspapers said it was a relative who first called with his name
but the dispute is set to rumble on the opposition labor party's spokesman on press matters who is also the legislator for blackburn formally protested to the watchdog press complaints commission
laborite jack straw called the news of the world's argument the flimsiest and most cynical excuse ever
russian warplanes bombed targets across the rebel republic of chechnya on sunday but the separatists remained defiant and demanded the kremlin withdraw its troops
russian tanks also opened fire on a convoy of cars heading toward neighboring ingushetia killing at least nine people including four women the tanks then crushed three cars
the itar-tass news agency said russian planes targeted military equipment and five bridges across the terek river which divides the chechen republic the operation began at 10 am 0700 gmt the agency said

russia must withdraw its forces quickly and recognize our political independence chechen vice president zelimkhan yandarbiyev said
chechen leader dzhokhar dudayev had offered last-minute talks saturday to end the fighting but president boris yeltsin demanded sunday that dudayev sign a disarmament agreement first
yeltsin suggested a meeting between dudayev and some top russian ministers but yandarbiyev said dudayev would meet only with yeltsin or prime minister viktor chernomyrdin the interfax news agency said
the air strikes came after people in grozny spent a cold anxious night in basements and makeshift bomb shelters
self-defense units patrolled the streets overnight and armored vehicles headed for the city's outskirts by mid-morning traders were out at the market
what is there to be scared of said 25-year-old khaza khutoyeva as she peddled russian champagne and american cigarettes i'm not scared at all
the russian government promised to use force humanely and urged women children and non-combatants to leave grozny state-run ostankino tv said sunday that 67000 refugees have fled to neighboring ingushetia
early sunday russian tanks cut off the last three cars in the 11-car convoy headed toward ingushetia from grozny near the village of nesterovskaya
the tanks opened fire on the three cars and continued firing as people jumped from the cars and began running away then a tank smashed the three cars on the muddy road at least nine people were killed

news agencies said at least two russian soldiers were killed in skirmishes with chechen fighters
yeltsin's office released a statement saying the president's determination remains firm to restore moscow's authority in the rebel republic
yeltsin sent an estimated 10000 to 40000 soldiers into chechnya a mostly muslim republic of about 12 million people in the caucasus mountains a week ago in a bid to end the chechen independence drive
some russian soldiers have seemed reluctant to fight some vowed not to advance even if it meant disobeying direct orders
a mutiny you could call it that said a lieutenant colonel from the russian 19th motorized infantry division dug in about 50 kilometers 30 miles west of grozny he spoke on condition of anonymity

ac parma reclaimed first place in the italian first division sunday with a 2-1 victory at bari while juventus of turin's six-game winning streak was snapped in a dramatic 1-1 draw with lowly genoa
all eight afternoon league matches kicked off 45 minutes late because of a players' association protest to press the national soccer federation to come up with money for unemployed players and coaches
on the field midfielder massimo crippa put back a rebound for parma's winner in the 77th minute parma's 9-4-1 record gives it 31 points one more than juventus 9-3-1

socialist leader zhan videnov buoyed by opinion polls favoring his party of former communists predicted a crushing defeat of the main anti-communist alliance in sunday's parliamentary elections
according to the polls the socialists would garner some 30 percent of the vote and the staunchly anti-communist union of democratic forces 20 percent with the movement for rights and freedoms mrf supported by ethnic turks a distant third
nationwide voter turnout was reported to be about 50 percent by 4 pm 1400 gmt three hours before the tentatively scheduled closure of the polling stations first projections were not expected before 9 pm 1900 gmt
in the capital of sofia a main stronghold of filip dimitrov's union of democratic forces udf turnout was only about 40 percent by 4 pm
after casting his ballot videnov a 35-year-old economic expert said he expected a success of the left-wing forces and a crushing defeat of those whose idea of transition has proved a fiasco
reflecting the political stalemate that has plagued bulgaria for the last three years both major parties claim the government of unaffiliated premier lyuben berov who resigned in september had been controlled by the other
thus svetoslav luchnikov justice minister in dimitrov's 10-month government in 1992 castigated the unimaginably bad policies of the berov government
dimitrov the 39-year-old udf leader only said god may grant it in response to supporters wishing him an election victory
a udf spokesman said dimitrov who has ruled out a coalition with the socialists would not comment until after results are known
in the last elections in october 1991 the socialists won 106 seats second to udf's 110 neither had a majority in the 240-seat parliament that led to two weak governments unable to push through badly needed reforms

all three visiting nations are making their first visits since south africa returned to international cricket in 1991 after being banned two decades because of apartheid the winner's trophy is named for nelson mandela who became south africa's first black president following the nation's first all-race election in april
rightist extremists from across germany converged on a small bavarian town for a winter solstice bonfire but police broke up the holiday gathering before the fire was set authorities said sunday
the police action in marzling north of munich on saturday evening came as a news magazine reported that the federal interior ministry plans to ban four more neo-nazi groups
last-minute information led police to a tavern in marzling where the roughly 160 rightists had gathered under the guise of a record company christmas party authorities said
police were thus able to prevent the extremists from moving to a clearing in the woods where logs had been stacked 3 meters 10 feet high for a bonfire no arrests were made and police did not release names
gatherings by members of banned neo-nazi groups are illegal in germany
der spiegel magazine reported meanwhile that federal authorities plan to add to their list of banned neo-nazi organizations these groups german nationalists dn assistance organization for national political prisoners and their relatives hng direct action-central germany the national democratic party's npd youth organization jn
the interior ministry refused to comment on the report
germany has an estimated 40000 neo-nazis although the hard core is far smaller rightist extremists have killed at least 30 people in germany in the last four years in more than 5000 attacks
frequently as police say is the case with the german nationalists for example neo-nazis who find their organization banned simply start a new one under a different name
the german nationalists who had a national meeting broken up by police in east berlin last weekend were previously known as the german alternative which was banned two years ago
germany played like a three-time world champion for just 20 mnutes sunday but that was enough to beat gritty albania 2-1 in a european championship qualifying match
after an opening blitz the germans played a ragged match in a performance sure to increase the pressure on beleaguered coach berti vogts
when we only beat albania 2-1 at home that's like a defeat for us germans said midfielder matthias sammer
behind goals by lothar matthaeus and juergen klinsmann germany ran its record to 3-0 in group 7 they are tied with bulgaria which ousted them in the world cup quarterfinals
sc freiburg's striker altin rraklli scored albania's goal by launching a shot into the left corner of the net in the 58th minute
the german players still stinging from criticism over the world cup upset by bulgaria came onto the field trying to prove that wednesday's 3-0 shutout over moldavia was the start of an upswing

the winter tourist season has begun with opposition leader edward seaga calling on the government to spend $15 more to advertise jamaica as a tourist destination
in a statement during the weekend seaga said the best projections for the 1994-95 tourist season indicate a hope that it will not continue the decline which was experienced over the past year
stating that another bad winter season is likely to see a number of smaller hotels go under he said small hotels had been hurting badly from the failure of the past season to show any growth in visitors and as a result have had to discount their rates by as much as 50 percent to enable some cash flow to be generatd to keep the doors open
seaga said that even the larger operators have had to discount rates but to a lesser extent generally 20 percent what that meant seaga said is that jamaica could earn an extra $300 million more in receipts this year if there was no discounting and $150 million of that would be a net increase to the country's foreign exchange supply
these extra earnings would flow immediately if there was more advertising of jamaica as a destination seaga said
knowledgeable persons in the industry advise that an additional $15 million in advertising would attract enough additional visitors to increase occupancy levels to a point where hotels could get their normal rates with far less discounting
director of tourism fay pickersgill responded that jamaica was still the best that she said is the message coming over loud and clear from travel interests in major cities throughout the world
for breath-taking physical beauty for excellence in resort facilities for a rich unique cultural experience for spontaniety warmth and good old-fashioned hospitality jamaica is still considered a glorious place for a holiday pickersgill said
she said the voice of jamaica's tourism was even stronger in the marketplace in north and south america europe and the far east as the jamaica tourist board has strengthened its adverstising and marketing activities tourism earned $950 million in 1993 representing 45 percent of the country's foreign exchange inflows making it the largest single foreign exchange earner
according to rae barrett chairman of the jamaica tourist board for the first 10 months of 1994 total visitor arrivals reached 1291297 a decline of 23 percent against 1993 there were 810525 stopovers during the period a decline of one tenth or one percent against the corresponding period in 1993 crusise passengers showed a decline of 5 percent between january and october 1994 carlyle dunkley minister of industry commerce and tourism says that despite negative publicity in the marketplace jamaica is expecting a good tourist season
jampress the government news agency quotes him as saying the tourism sector had experienced some decline this past year particularly because of increasing crime and violence in the island and the attendant poor image of jamaica abroad pointing to what he said was an upturn in the market dunkley said there was cause for optimism as 69000 visitors had arrived in jamaica in october a month when arrivals are usually low
rightist extremists from across germany converged on a small bavarian town for a winter solstice bonfire but police broke up the holiday gathering before the fire was set authorities said sunday
the police action saturday evening in marzling north of munich came as a news magazine reported that the federal interior ministry plans to ban four more neo-nazi groups
last-minute information led police to a tavern in marzling where roughly 160 rightists had gathered under the guise of a record company christmas party authorities said
police were able to prevent the extremists from moving to a clearing in the woods where logs had been stacked 3 meters 10 feet high for a bonfire no arrests were made and police did not release names
gatherings by members of banned neo-nazi groups are illegal in germany
der spiegel magazine reported meanwhile that federal authorities plan to add to their list of banned neo-nazi organizations the german nationalists the assistance organization for national political prisoners and their relatives direct action-central germany and the national democratic party's youth organization
the interior ministry refused to comment on the report
socialist leader zhan videnov buoyed by opinion polls favoring his party of former communists predicted a resounding victory
the socialist party has garnered about 30 percent support in earlier polls while the anti-communist union of democratic forces udf had about 20 percent a party representing ethnic turks has been a distant third
across central and eastern europe one-time communists are on the rise in hungary they swept may elections in slovakia a new party espousing orthodox communist views is part of a new governing coalition
nationwide voter turnout was reported to be about 50 percent by 4 pm 1400 gmt three hours before polls were to close first projections were not expected before 9 pm 1900 gmt bulgaria has about 63 million eligible voters
in the capital of sofia a main stronghold of filip dimitrov's udf turnout was only about 40 percent he has already ruled out a coalition with the socialists
after casting his ballot videnov a 35-year-old economic expert said he expected a success of the left-wing forces and a crushing defeat of those whose idea of transition has proved a fiasco
in the last elections in october 1991 the socialists won 106 seats second to udf's 110 neither had a majority in the 240-seat parliament that led to a succession of weak governments unable to push through reforms
reflecting the political stalemate that has plagued bulgaria for the last three years both major parties claim the government of independent premier lyuben berov who resigned in september had been controlled by the other
after casting his ballot president zhelyu zhelev said if there is a strong and working parliament there also will be a strong and working executive the state news agency bta reported
in a surprise tv appearance saturday night zhelev urged bulgarians to vote in large numbers hinting their support for smaller parties could help break the parliamentary deadlock
some of the voters were pessimistic about the future following years of government crises and parliamentary deadlock
i am very disappointed i have almost no hope after all that happened in the last few years in this country said marina sapundzhieva a clerk in her mid 40s
nikolai danev a lawyer and udf activist predicted that unless one of the two major parties achieves a clear majority in parliament the result will be early elections in six months or a year at the most
the two major parties appear to agree on only one thing the need to combat rampant crime and corruption which threaten to undermine the still shaky democratic system
police statistics say that corruption has cost the country an estimated 118 billion leva dlrs 180 million this year
annual inflation in bulgaria is expected to reach 120 percent by the end of the year some 70 percent of the population of 85 million live on the verge of poverty and about 740000 are jobless
the socialists now support market reforms but they plead for a slow transition to avoid hardship for those with low incomes including pensioners and the unemployed
his voice shaking with anger pope john paul ii made a new plea sunday for peace in bosnia this time in the name of christmas
stop yourselves stop yourselves in front of the infant jesus the pope said in an impromptu ending to his regular sunday appearance in st peter's square
referring to a letter to the world's children released a few days earlier in which he asked them to pray for peace john paul said his appeal for an end to war also applied to those who are responsible for the wars far and near
we think of everybody but perhaps with special insistence of those who are near on the other shore of the adriatic the pope said referring to the former yugoslavia across the sea from italy
at rome the league's two stingiest defenses left little room as roma failed to beat milan at olympic stadium for the ninth straight time roma keeper giovanni cervone made great saves on drives by defender paolo maldini and midfielder demetrio albertini in the 18th and 29th minutes respectively
roma has allowed eight goals and milan nine this season
at genoa samp 5-6-3 shut out by last-place brescia a week earlier shredded the cagliari defense for three goals by the 18th minute italian international winger attilio lombardo hit the opener in the eighth minute and assisted on dutchman rudd gullit's fifth goal of the season in the 14th english international david platt connected four minutes later
captain-striker roberto mancini added samp's fourth on a header in first-half injury time and claudio bellucci scored his first league goal in the 67th minute cagliari fell to 4-5-5
at cremona the hosts' anemic offense nine goals in its prior 13 games exploded in the first half striker alessio pirri started things in the 16th minute andrea tentoni doubled with his fourth of the year in the 38th and forward enrico chiesa fixed the final score in injury time the win moved cremonese 5-0-9 out of the relegation zone while torino dropped to 4-3-5
at reggio emilio the suspensions of padova defenders david balleri and american alexi lalas helped the hosts 2-3-8 gain their second straight win
winger michele padovano converted from the penalty spot in the sixth minute and a 17th-minute counterattack was finished by massimiliano esposito padovano added his fourth goal of the season in the 50th padova is 3-2-9
germany scored twice in the first 17 minutes and then hung on to beat lowly albania 2-1 sunday in a european championship qualifying match that likely will renew criticism of german coach berti vogts
germany jumped out to a 2-0 lead on goals by lothar matthaeus and juergen klinsmann but then struggled against a team which had lost all three previous qualifying games by a combined score of 5-1
sunday's victory was by the same unconvincing score that germany beat albania in tirana on nov 16 in the away leg
when we only beat albania 2-1 at home that's like a defeat for us germans midfielder matthias sammer said
the victory improved germany to 3-0-0 in qualifying putting it in a virtual tie for first place in group 7 with bulgaria which retained a slight edge on goal differential
sc freiburg's striker altin rraklli scored albania's goal by launching a shot into the left corner in the 58th minute
israel has offered a temporary troop pullout from palestinian towns in the west bank on the eve of palestinian elections arguing that full withdrawal from all population centers was impossible because of concern for the security of jewish settlers

but violence by islamic militants has cost 32 israeli lives since oct 1 and prompted israel to reconsider

germany played like a three-time world champion for only 20 minutes sunday but that was enough to beat gritty albania 2-1 in a european championship qualifying match
after an opening blitz the germans played a ragged match in a performance sure to increase the pressure on beleaguered coach berti vogts
when we only beat albania 2-1 at home that's like a defeat for us germans said midfielder matthias sammer
behind goals by lothar matthaeus and juergen klinsmann germany ran its record to 3-0 in group 7 they are tied with bulgaria which ousted them in the world cup quarterfinals
altin rraklli scored albania's goal in the 58th minute off a pass from fellow forward indrit fortuzi after that the german squad seemed to fall apart
it came with that goal for some reason the players tightened up said vogts of the dismal second-half performance i didn't like it all there's going to be some discussion
vogts has been taking heat since the team was beaten in the world cup quarterfinals in a recent poll 70 percent of germany's first division players felt he was the wrong man to head the team
the german players came onto the field trying to prove that wednesday's 3-0 shutout over moldavia was the start of an upswing

the disappearance of an american military helicopter over north korea raises doubt about the united states' relations with the communist regime us senators said sunday
republican sen pete domenici said washington should warn north korea of the risks of holding us military personnel two us army crewmen manned the helicopter when it disappeared after straying across the border saturday
until the two aviators are returned the united states should refuse to finance the high-technology nuclear power reactor promised north korea in exchange for its recent agreement to scrap a suspected nuclear weapons project domenici said on nbc's meet the press
on the same tv program republican sen robert packwood urged negotiations to gain the americans' return but he also said he wanted more information on the copter's mission before further action
packwood recalled the soviets' downing of an american u-2 spy plane in the 1950s which the united states initially described as an innocent weather monitor
democratic sen daniel patrick moynihan was asked on the cbs program face the nation if the helicopter issue should prompt the united states to delay implementation of the nuclear deal
that's exactly what the north koreans should be asking moynihan replied
they are not exactly in an enviable position are they he added their dictator the late president kim il sung is dead their economy is dead
record-breaker brazil was a popular winner of the best attended world cup of all time yet the tournament the first to be held in the united states also turned up diego maradona's latest drug scandal and led to the most tragic event of all the killing of colombian defender andres escobar
for soccer 1994 was that sort of year
brazil and italy both three-time winners made it to the world cup final and promised a feast of high-quality soccer they didn't produce
instead after 120 minutes of lifeless play some 84000 sun-drenched fans in pasadena calif saw the first ever penalty shootout in a final as brazil won the cup for a record fourth time
american soccer fans including some who tuned into the game for the first time loved the world cup atmosphere nearly 36 million fans at 52 matches an average of 69000 whooped and roared at what proved to be a high-scoring competition with forwards usually outsmarting defenders
the downsides of the world cup were big and obvious
maradona who looked impressive in argentina's first two games tested positive for what fifa called a cocktail of drugs aimed at helping rapid weight loss he was banned for 15 months for the second time in his career and argentia was eliminated two losses later
then escobar was killed returning home after the first round escobar was killed supposedly for scoring an own-goal against the united states in a 2-1 loss
considered one of the pre-tournament favorites colombia was hounded by pressure from gangs in their native country over personnel decisions including a death against midfielder gabriel gomes to keep him from playing against the americans
by the end of the year fifa was saying that the so-called spirit of america generated by the competition had evaporated
according to fifa players continued to cheat coaches were intimidating referees and referees were inconsistently applying the rules
away from the world cup the pattern was the same
italian power ac milan produced the best club performance of the year a 4-0 crushing of barcelona in the champions cup final without two of its key defenders yet the red devils ended the year almost on their knees
slumping alarmingly milan scrambled into european champions cup quarterfinals on a 1-0 victory at casino salzburg and halfway through the italian league season had fallen into the bottom half of the standings
by mid-december milan had been eliminated from the italian cup in the second round by crosstown rival inter and also lost to south american champion velez sarsfield in the toyota cup 2-0
its fans let them down too uefa penalized milan two points in the european champions league because of a bottle thrown from the stands that hit salzburg goalkeeper otto konrad
elsewhere manchester united winner of the rare league-cup double in england in may performed poorly in european play in the fall and never reached the champions cup quarterfinals

indvidually it was the year of romario bebeto baggio stoichkov hagi and savicevic
romario and bebeto rivals with barcelona and deportive de la coruna in a neck and neck spanish title race teamed up so effectively as brazil's strikeforce it was almost as if they were twins
roberto baggio almost single handedly lifted a flagging italian team with match-winning goals and inspirational play that eventually drove the team to the world cup final
battling injury the juventus striker just couldn't keep going and even missed a penalty in the shootout as brazil won
hristo stoichkov another member of the barcelona team that won a fourth consecutive spanish league title scored one of the bulgarian goals that ended germany's reign as world cup champion
bulgaria which had never won a game in six previous world cup finals rallied for a 2-1 upset over the germans in the quarterfinals
gheorghe hagi masterminded romania's world cup campaign and also wound up at barcelona for the 1994-95 season the imaginative midfielder and goalmaker was the main reason why what appeared to be the ugly ducking team of the world cup turned out to be one of the most attractive
dejan savicevic was the key to ac milan's champions cup triumph over barcelona but otherwise was invisible without a national team to play for

in south america velez sarsfield won its first copa libertadores after a penalty shootout with defending champion sao paulo of brazil becoming the first argentine club to win since river plate in 1986
england which failed to qualify for the world cup had more problems in their domestic league but enjoyed an upsurge during 1994 with terry venables taking over as coach of the national team and clubs spending money to import world cup stars such as germany's juergen klinsmann
the football association fined tottenham 15 million pounds dlrs 24 million banned it from the fa cup and threatened to deduct six league points after finding the club guilty of financial irregularities relating to player payments
on appeal an arbitration panel later ordered the fa to restore the six points and the club's status in the fa cup
venables was pursued constantly by allegations that some of his business deals were illegal and zimbabwean goalkeeper bruce grobbelaar who moved from liverpool to southampton was accused of accepting a bribe to throw a game
venables and grobbelaar denied all the allegations but the turmoil created seemed to outweigh the good performances on the field
former us president jimmy carter arrived in sarajevo on sunday seeking the elusive answer to 32 months of balkan war that have frustrated every other international mediator
carter emerged from his un plane wearing a flak jacket as dusk was falling on the bosnian capital and headed along so-called sniper alley in the city center hours earlier rocket-propelled grenades peppered part of the street slightly injuring a french peacekeeper and a civilian
carter was expected to meet bosnian president alija izetbegovic later sunday and travel to the village of pale bosnian serb headquarters on monday
physical danger was not the only challenge for carter who earlier this year took his brand of free-lance diplomacy to north korea and haiti there was widespread skepticism he could bridge the differences between bosnian serbs and the muslim-led government
parties as diverse as izetbegovic and serbian president slobodan milosevic whose nationalist appeals are widely blamed for starting the bosnian war in 1992 said bosnian serbs may try to use carter's visit to circumvent a peace plan of the so-called contact group composed of the united states russia britain france and germany
carter became involved in bosnia after being contacted by bosnian serb leader radovan karadzic
carter told reporters at the airport that he hoped to contribute to an easing of tensions based on pledges by karadzic to normalize relations with the united nations and then hopefully see some movement toward a comprehensive cease-fire throughout the nation and negotiations based on the contact group's proposals
karadzic promised to end a period of high tension between the united nations and bosnian serbs that followed three nato airstrikes a month ago hundreds of peacekeepers were detained un movements were frozen and the sarajevo airport was closed it reopened with two un flights on saturday
before arriving in sarajevo carter stopped in zagreb the capital of the neighboring yugoslavia republic croatia which fought its own war with serb rebels in 1991 there he met with president franjo tudjman and the bosnian prime minister haris silajdzic
many previous mediation efforts and cease-fires have failed in the bosnian war in which an estimated 200000 people are listed as dead or missing
the outline of central issues facing carter was emerging in comments made by both sides as the visit began
bosnian government officials insisted that the serbs accept the contact group plan which they repeatedly have rejected it would leave the serbs with 49 percent of bosnia instead of the 70 percent they now hold and grant them no recognition of sovereignty or confederal links with serbia
silajdzic said negotiations were possible after the serbs accepted the plan once they accept the peace plan there are a lot of things we can talk about he said
that seemed to fit a subtle shift in the contact group approach that emerged earlier this month it was presented as a take-it or leave-it plan this summer but the us representative on the group charles thomas said dec 8 both sides could change anything they wanted by mutual consent
karadzic could be tempted to say yes to the framework of the plan to blunt international criticism but reserve acceptance of any details
that would leave the combatants and the international community with agreement on a blank peace plan no further ahead than they are now
there is likely to be continued disagreement on bosnian serbs' demand for sovereignty rather than the confederal links with serbs that they long have demanded that has emerged as a key bosnian serb demand in recent weeks
karadzic apparently is seeking sovereignty as a means to secure his own position as his relations with the powerful milosevic deteriorate bosnian serbs are looking at carter's involvement as a way of opening up a direct link to washington their foes' biggest supporter that could be interpreted as de facto recognition
if america so decided the war in bosnia-herzegovina cold be over before new year said aleksa buha the foreign minister of the bosnian serb self-proclaimed state if carter's arrival would make formal the recognition of the bosnian serbs' state then the major part of the work would be done
silajdzic stressed that was unacceptable and added of the carter visit i do not think that this is any kind of international recognition
there was more bad news from the battlefront sunday for the bosnian government
bosnian army officials confirmed reports saturday that the key northwest town of velika kladusa had fallen to weeks of attack by serbs and renegade muslims bosnian army officials in sarajevo said the remaining defenders had managed to pull out

russian warplanes bombed targets across the rebel republic of chechnya on sunday and troops were poised to move on the capital city of grozny after chechen fighters ignored a deadline to disarm
russian tanks also opened fire on a convoy of refugees' cars heading toward neighboring ingushetia killing at least nine people including four women the tanks then crushed three cars
efforts to restart talks continued and chechen leader dzhokhar dudayev agreed sunday night to meet yeltsin's representatives counterintelligence chief sergei stepashin and deputy prime minister nikolai yegorov
moscow sent 10000 to 40000 troops into the republic in the caucasus mountains of southern russia a week ago to put down an independence drive
president boris yeltsin has staked considerable political capital on resolving the conflict quickly and with minimum casualties the military offensive in the mostly muslim republic of about 12 million people is generally unpopular not only with the public but among russian troops
dudayev's consent to talks came in a telegram to yeltsin the itar-tass and interfax news agencies reported earlier his deputies had said he would meet only with yeltsin or prime minister viktor chernomyrdin
but yeltsin also has demanded that dudayev agree to disarm his forces before talks something the chechen side has refused to do
yeltsin's chief of staff sergei filatov said sunday night that a military offensive by moscow was possible later in the evening
itar-tass said russian planes targeted military equipment and five bridges across the terek river which divides the chechen republic on sunday morning
there were no strikes on grozny itself but russian fighters buzzed the city earlier and artillery boomed northwest of town shortly after the kremlin deadline to disarm by midnight saturday expired
russia must withdraw its forces quickly and recognize our political independence chechen vice president zelimkhan yandarbiyev said
people in grozny spent a cold anxious night saturday in basements and makeshift bomb shelters self-defense units patrolled the streets and armored vehicles headed for the city's outskirts by mid-morning however traders were out at the market
what is there to be scared of said 25-year-old khaza khutoyeva as she peddled russian champagne and american cigarettes
the russian government promised to use force humanely and urged women children and non-combatants to leave grozny state-run ostankino tv said sunday that 67000 refugees have fled to neighboring ingushetia
early sunday russian tanks cut off the last three cars in a convoy of a dozen headed toward ingushetia from grozny near the village of nesterovskaya
the tanks opened fire on the three cars and continued firing as refugees jumped out and began running away then a tank smashed the three cars on the muddy road at least nine people were killed
the commanders had orders to let the refugees pass but these cars were fired upon and squashed said khamzat bekov ingushetia's emergency situations minister then they tried to conceal all the traces we cannot find the bodies the wounded
how can we save ourselves one woman told associated press television as she stood near a demolished car if our legs can take us out of here we go if not they crush us
russian planes bombed an airfield as well as armored vehicles southeast of grozny on sunday morning interfax also reported a rocket attack on pervomaiskoye northeast of grozny and khankala an eastern suburb
it is unclear how many people have been killed in the week-long russian offensive the chechen side has not reported casualties unconfirmed reports say hundreds of civilians may be dead and at least 17 russian soldiers news agencies said at least two russian soldiers were killed sunday
it is also hard to measure the extent of discontent in the russian army
one commander was recalled saturday after promising villagers his tanks would not storm grozny some soldiers have vowed not to advance even if it means disobeying orders

rabbis have outlawed a couple's marriage 12 years after the fact over a family sin committed some 2500 years ago a newspaper said sunday
the religious affairs ministry said that shoshana hadad and masoud cohen may also undergo criminal investigation on suspicion of misleading a rabbi into marrying them in 1982
the ruling carries uncommon weight because the orthodox rabbinical courts have a monopoly over weddings in israel
the case summarized by the daily yedioth ahronoth is based on a historic rumor
rabbis believed that hadad a tunisian immigrant was descended from a clan from djerba a clan member descended from a priestly family was rumored to have illegally married a divorcee at around 580 bc the newspaper said
this transgression marked the entire family bringing rabbinical decrees that their daughters for generations such as shoshana hadad could never marry a cohen cohens are descendants of the original jewish temple priests and should follow certain laws in family matters
when rabbis in tiberias in northern israel refused to marry them cohen and hadad had a religious wedding in meron another galilee town hadad said on israel radio she said that she believed that made it official despite the doubts about her family's past
the newspaper indicated that the couple learned only recently that the wedding wasn't recognized while trying to register a 4-year-old son at the interior ministry hadad was told she was still listed as single despite the marriage
this is scandalousit's intolerable hadad was quoted as saying
moshe friedman spokesman for the religious affairs ministry accused the couple of marrying by deception and in criminal ways and said the rabbi involved would complain to police
the headlines blared when a woman was awarded dlrs 27 million after spilling hot mcdonald's coffee in her lap and when a jury penalized ford motor co dlrs 125 million over pintos with exploding gas tanks
but what people may not realize is that the companies ended up paying only a fraction of the original jury awards
verdicts like these have led to a movement to limit the damages that companies can be ordered to pay when their products harm someone most states have revised their laws governing such cases
now republicans in the house of representatives are asking the us congress to enact nationwide controls in 1995 and with republicans majorities in both the house and senate next year action on the bill seems likely
the common sense legal reform act would make it harder to win punitive damages those aimed at punishing companies that sell harmful products and limit the sums awarded to injured people
it also would force the losers of many federal lawsuits to pay the winner's legal fees
the attack thursday marked the first such violence in monrovia since rebel leader charles taylor tried to seize the city two years ago

on saturday authorities arrested several men carrying hand grenades west of the city and another man with a satchel of assault rifles on the north side
the jamaica hotel and tourist association says it supports the government's decision to discontinue the spraying of aircraft while passengers are on board
also it says it backs the government's decision to cease the requirement of outgoing processing for departing airline passengers
our association welcomes these new measures as the cessation of the spraying will be in keeping with international standards while the abolition of outgoing emigration processing will help to speed up the flow of departing passengers at our international airports the jhta stated recently
the association said it looked forward to further steps being taken including the protection of the airport environment from illegal operators and in upgrading the system of processing passengers at both international airports so that visitors to jamaica will arrive and depart with good first and last impressions of jamaica

however sections of the plane will be sprayed during maintenance in announcing the decision not to require passengers leaving jamaica to fill out emigration cards patterson said this was being done to speed processing at the two international airports and offer a more efficient service

rabbis have outlawed a couple's marriage 12 years after the fact over a family sin committed some 2500 years ago news reports said sunday
the religious affairs ministry said that shoshana hadad and masoud cohen may also undergo criminal investigation on suspicion of misleading a rabbi into marrying them in 1982
the ruling carries uncommon weight because the orthodox rabbinical courts have a monopoly over weddings in israel

former us president jimmy carter arrived in sarajevo on sunday seeking the elusive answer to 32 months of balkan war that have frustrated every other international mediator
carter emerged from his un plane wearing a flak jacket as dusk was falling on the bosnian capital and headed along so-called sniper alley in the city center
police were posted every 100 meters yards along the street
but a source among carter's escort said recent impacts by rocket-propelled grenades forced his caravan to take a detour near the city center where the avenue runs close to the frontline hours earlier other rpgs peppered part of the street slightly injuring a french peacekeeper and a civilian
carter headed to the bosnian presidency building in heart of the city for a meeting with bosnian president alija izetbegovic and other senior officials he was expected to travel to the village of pale bosnian serb headquarters on monday
physical danger was not the only challenge for carter who earlier this year took his brand of free-lance diplomacy to north korea and haiti there was widespread skepticism he could bridge the differences between bosnian serbs and the muslim-led government
parties as diverse as izetbegovic and serbian president slobodan milosevic whose nationalist appeals are widely blamed for starting the bosnian war in 1992 said bosnian serbs may try to use carter's visit to circumvent a peace plan of the so-called contact group composed of the united states russia britain france and germany
carter became involved in bosnia after being contacted by bosnian serb leader radovan karadzic
carter told reporters at the airport that he hoped to contribute to an easing of tensions based on pledges by karadzic to normalize relations with the united nations and then hopefully see some movement toward a comprehensive cease-fire throughout the nation and negotiations based on the contact group's proposals
karadzic promised to end a period of high tension between the united nations and bosnian serbs that followed three nato airstrikes a month ago hundreds of peacekeepers were detained un movements were frozen and the sarajevo airport was closed it reopened with two un flights on saturday
before arriving in sarajevo carter stopped in zagreb the capital of the neighboring yugoslavia republic croatia which fought its own war with serb rebels in 1991 there he met with president franjo tudjman and the bosnian prime minister haris silajdzic
many previous mediation efforts and cease-fires have failed in the bosnian war in which an estimated 200000 people are listed as dead or missing
the outline of central issues facing carter was emerging in comments made by both sides as the visit began
bosnian government officials insisted that the serbs accept the contact group plan which they repeatedly have rejected it would leave the serbs with 49 percent of bosnia instead of the 70 percent they now hold and grant them no recognition of sovereignty or confederal links with serbia
silajdzic said negotiations were possible after the serbs accepted the plan once they accept the peace plan there are a lot of things we can talk about he said
that seemed to fit a subtle shift in the contact group approach that emerged earlier this month it was presented as a take-it or leave-it plan this summer but the us representative on the group charles thomas said dec 8 both sides could change anything they wanted by mutual consent
karadzic could be tempted to say yes to the framework of the plan to blunt international criticism but reserve acceptance of any details
that would leave the combatants and the international community with agreement on a blank peace plan no further ahead than they are now
there is likely to be continued disagreement on bosnian serbs' demand for sovereignty rather than the confederal links with serbs that they long have demanded that has emerged as a key bosnian serb demand in recent weeks
karadzic apparently is seeking sovereignty as a means to secure his own position as his relations with the powerful milosevic deteriorate bosnian serbs are looking at carter's involvement as a way of opening up a direct link to washington their foes' biggest supporter that could be interpreted as de facto recognition
if america so decided the war in bosnia-herzegovina cold be over before new year said aleksa buha the foreign minister of the bosnian serb self-proclaimed state if carter's arrival would make formal the recognition of the bosnian serbs' state then the major part of the work would be done
silajdzic stressed that was unacceptable and added of the carter visit i do not think that this is any kind of international recognition
there was more bad news from the battlefront sunday for the bosnian government

up to nine refugees including four women were killed by apparently drunken russian soldiers who attacked a convoy of cars in the breakaway republic of chechnya witnesses and officials said
a russian soldier also was killed in the bloodshed under unclear circumstances and his body was abandoned by his unit
russian officials and local leaders in neighboring ingushetia said sunday that the cars carrying refugees to ingushetia from chechnya were crushed by russian armored vehicles near this village on saturday evening
there are different versions of the tragedy which occurred on a back road about 45 kilometers 28 miles west of the chechen capital grozny
one is that the soldiers attacked the refugees to avenge an attack by chechen fighters with rocket-propelled grenades according to that version the chechen attack killed the russian soldier and destroyed the armored personnel carrier he was driving
another version is that the russian soldiers themselves shot their comrade and blew up the armored personnel carrier in an argument or to hide a massacre
the scene testifies to a terrible manhunt three crushed zhiguli cars lay on a roadside in an open snowy field a half-eaten loaf of bread lay on the rear window of one car
blood-covered footsteps led from the cars to thin bushes along the road and the ground was littered with spent cartridges from a large-caliber machine gun a woman's clothes lay nearby
one investigator said a child's footprints appeared to be next to a woman's a glass jar apparently containing children's food was lying on the ground in a pool of dried blood
according to the traces they chased and killed the wounded then dragged them away said an ingush investigator at the scene who did not give his name
after the shooting a wounded man was brought to the hospital in sleptsovskoye about 18 kilometers 11 miles away and died there
ambulances and police cars were initially kept away from the site by shots journalists who went there in an ambulance saturday night saw two armored personnel carriers and two light tanks firing flares and machine gun rounds in the dark
the russian soldier's body was found near the destroyed armored vehicle about a mile away vostrotin identified him as danil agadulin of ufa a driver in his pocket was a telegram from home congratulating him on his 19th birthday dec 11
the soldier had been shot in the shoulder and had a broken arm he died of exposure and loss of blood after being abandoned said vostrotin
the area along the undefined border between chechnya and ingushetia is indeed tense armed chechen fighters hide in some villages
while reporters and local officials were at the site sunday a russian helicopter flew over and rockets exploded to the east officials ordered everyone to disperse fearing an army attack on the group
ingushetia is populated by ethnic brethren of the chechens five ingush including the republic's health minister were killed and 13 were wounded a week ago when they tried to stop the advance of russian columns

but it does not agree to any step prejudicial to its national security

up to nine refugees including four women were killed by apparently drunken russian soldiers who attacked a convoy of cars in the breakaway republic of chechnya witnesses and officials said
a russian soldier also was killed in the bloodshed under unclear circumstances and his body was abandoned by his unit
russian officials and local leaders in neighboring ingushetia said sunday that the cars carrying refugees to ingushetia from chechnya were crushed by russian armored vehicles near this village on saturday evening
wounded refugees who tried to get away were chased down and shot they said
the commanders had orders to let the refugees pass but these cars were fired upon and squashed said khamzat bekov ingushetia's emergency situations minister then they tried to conceal all the traces we cannot find the bodies the wounded
he said officials fear a wave of unrest and reprisal attacks on soldiers
lt gen valery vostrotin russia's deputy emergency situations minister said nine people were believed to have been killed and that some could have been children
both officials blamed lack of discipline among the interior ministry troops who patrol roads and guard the rear flank of the army which rolled into chechnya a week ago in an attempt to crush its bid for independence from the russian federation
i travel around and all i see is drunken soldiers and drunken officers manning the posts vostrotin said they have no discipline and they go unpunished
officials quoted witnesses as saying the soldiers involved in the events saturday evening were terribly drunk
there are different versions of the tragedy which occurred on a back road about 45 kilometers 28 miles west of the chechen capital grozny
one is that the soldiers attacked the refugees to avenge an attack by chechen fighters with rocket-propelled grenades according to that version the chechen attack killed the russian soldier and destroyed the armored personnel carrier he was driving
another version is that the russian soldiers themselves shot their comrade and blew up the armored personnel carrier in an argument or to hide a massacre
the scene testifies to a terrible manhunt three crushed zhiguli cars lay on a roadside in an open snowy field a half-eaten loaf of bread lay on the rear window of one car
blood-covered footsteps led from the cars to thin bushes along the road and the ground was littered with spent cartridges from a large-caliber machine gun a woman's clothes lay nearby
one investigator said a child's footprints appeared to be next to a woman's a glass jar apparently containing children's food was lying on the ground in a pool of dried blood
according to the traces they chased and killed the wounded then dragged them away said an ingush investigator at the scene who did not give his name
after the shooting a wounded man was brought to the hospital in sleptsovskoye about 18 kilometers 11 miles away and died there
ambulances and police cars were initially kept away from the site by shots journalists who went there in an ambulance saturday night saw two armored personnel carriers and two light tanks firing flares and machine gun rounds in the dark
the russian soldier's body was found near the destroyed armored vehicle about a mile away vostrotin identified him as danil agadulin of ufa a driver in his pocket was a telegram from home congratulating him on his 19th birthday dec 11
the soldier had been shot in the shoulder and had a broken arm he died of exposure and loss of blood after being abandoned said vostrotin
the area along the undefined border between chechnya and ingushetia is indeed tense armed chechen fighters hide in some villages
while reporters and local officials were at the site sunday a russian helicopter flew over and rockets exploded to the east officials ordered everyone to disperse fearing an army attack on the group
ingushetia is populated by ethnic brethren of the chechens five ingush including the republic's health minister were killed and 13 were wounded a week ago when they tried to stop the advance of russian columns

meanwhile south korean military sources said ground troops saw the helicopter fly into north korean territory but reported no signs of an attack or pursuit the newspaper dong-a ilbo reported
the united states said the helicopter was on a routine training mission north korean officials accused the united states and south korea of staging hostile air exercises
jim coles a us military spokesman in seoul called those accusations spurious untruths
further meetings were expected command officials said sunday in seoul south korea
also sunday richardson met with the north korean foreign minister and the chairman of north korea's legislature the north's official korean central news agency said the report gave no details of the discussions

richardson had gone to north korea to discuss the treaty calling for north korea to dismantle its nuclear program the administration enlisted him to devote his visit instead to getting the pilots released
the october signing of the treaty in which north korea promised to dismantle its nuclear reactor and open up its nuclear sites to eventual inspection had marked a sudden improvement in relations between the united states and north korea after months of confrontation over pyongyang's secretive nuclear program the two countries were moving toward establishing low-level diplomatic ties at the time of the helicopter incident
hilemon and hall were both members of a company 4th battalion 501st aviation regiment at camp page in south korea

quite evidently the pilots became disoriented and wandered over the border he said
american forces fought under the un flag for south korea during the 1950-53 korean war and 37000 american soldiers remain there to help patrol the border against north korea
london ap while arsenal manager george graham awaits the outcome of a premier league inquiry into allegations that he improperly received a 285000-pound dlrs 456000 gift from an agent former glasgow rangers and liverpool coach graeme souness denied claims that he collected 30000 pounds dlrs 48000 in a similar way
the tabloid mail on sunday which made the allegations against graham last weekend alleged that souness then manager of rangers sent his wife on a 750-mile 1200 kilometer round trip to collect 30000 pounds in cash from an israeli soccer agent
in a front page story the paper says that danielle souness drove from edinburgh to heathrow airport west of london and the money was handed to her under a table in a cocktail lounge
in a statement issued in london through his lawyers souness said the allegations were completely untrue
the statement said he planned to sue the mail on sunday for libel
the paper says the cash was a gift arising out of souness agreeing to buy two israelis defender avi cohen and goalkeeper boni ginsburg according to the mail on sunday rangers knew nothing of the 30000-pound payment which breaches rules laid down by the english and scottish soccer authorities
in a separate story the mail on sunday predicts that graham who has been arsenal manager since may 1986 will be thrown out of soccer by the end of january once the premier league has finished its inquiry
the paper says that the arsenal manager who was questioned by the premier league's three-man inquiry team on thursday failed to convince them of his innocence over the alleged payment
it is claimed that graham received the money soon after agreeing to pay 157 million pounds dlrs 25 million for danish midfielder john jensen

wearing a flak jacket former us president jimmy carter came to sarajevo on sunday seeking what has frustrated every other international mediator an end to bosnia's war
carter emerged from his un plane just as dusk was falling on the bosnian capital and headed along so-called sniper alley in the city center police were posted every 100 meters yards along the street
but a source among carter's escort said recent impacts by rocket-propelled grenades forced his caravan to take a detour near the city center where the avenue runs close to the frontline hours earlier similar grenades peppered part of the street slightly wounding a french peacekeeper and a civilian
carter headed to the bosnian presidency building in heart of the city for a meeting with bosnian president alija izetbegovic and other senior officials he was expected to travel to the village of pale bosnian serb headquarters on monday
physical danger was not the only challenge for carter who earlier this year served as a free-lance diplomat to north korea and haiti there was widespread skepticism that he could bridge the differences between bosnian serbs and the muslim-led government
the skeptics included parties as diverse as izetbegovic and serbian president slobodan milosevic whose nationalist appeals are widely blamed for starting the bosnian war in 1992 they said bosnian serbs may try to use carter's visit to circumvent a peace plan of the so-called contact group comprised of the united states russia britain france and germany
carter became involved in bosnia after being contacted by bosnian serb leader radovan karadzic
carter told reporters at the airport that he hoped to contribute to an easing of tensions based on pledges by karadzic to normalize relations with the united nations and then hopefully see some movement toward a comprehensive cease-fire throughout the nation and negotiations based on the contact group's proposals
karadzic promised to end a period of high tension between the united nations and bosnian serbs that followed three nato airstrikes a month ago hundreds of peacekeepers were detained un movements were frozen and the sarajevo airport was closed it reopened saturday with two un flights
before arriving in sarajevo carter stopped in zagreb the capital of the neighboring yugoslav republic croatia which fought its own war with serb rebels in 1991 there he met with president franjo tudjman and the bosnian prime minister haris silajdzic
many previous mediation efforts and cease-fires have failed in the bosnian war in which an estimated 200000 people are listed as dead or missing
the outline of central issues facing carter was emerging in comments made by both sides as the visit began
bosnian government officials insisted that the serbs accept the contact group plan which they repeatedly have rejected it would leave the serbs with 49 percent of bosnia instead of the 70 percent they now hold and grant them no recognition of sovereignty or confederal links with serbia
silajdzic said negotiations were possible after the serbs accepted the plan once they accept the peace plan there are a lot of things we can talk about he said
there was more bad news from the battlefront sunday for the bosnian government
bosnian army officials confirmed reports that the key northwest town of velika kladusa had fallen to weeks of attack by serbs and renegade muslims bosnian army officials in sarajevo said the remaining defenders had managed to pull out

first projections put the bulgarian socialist party of former communists far ahead in sunday's parliamentary elections
according to three bulgarian institutes monitoring incoming elections results the socialists led with a preliminary 42-44 percent of the votes the main anti-communist union of democratic forces had roughly 24 percent
the percentage for the mainly turkish movement for rights and freedoms was not given but apparently they managed to clear the four percent hurdle to win seats in parliament it appeared no other party would garner enough votes for parliamentary representation
the early projections were said to be based on representative samples from about two percent of votes counted
the three institutes making the early forecast were the local gallup international affiliate the bulgarian association for free elections and the civic initiative for free and democratic elections
pre-election opinion polls had given the socialists 30 percent and the union of democratic forces 20 percent
earlier in the day socialist leader zhan videnov a 35-year-old economic expert said he expected a success of the left-wing forces and a crushing defeat of those whose idea of transition has proved a fiasco

growing debts and organizational disarray have damaged the african national congress' ability to govern south africa its secretary general said sunday
cyril ramaphosa described the former revolutionary movement that won the nation's first all-race election in april as riddled with problems in a report to the anc's first national conference since taking power
although speaking with surprising candor about organizational difficulties ramaphosa's overall tone was far from pessimistic this is a very happy conference he said
the almost 3000 delegates applauded as ramaphosa the official in charge of administration within the anc read out a litany of organizational failings he spoke of a need for increased discipline financial controls accountability to the grassroots by anc parliament members and rebuilding local branches that have become moribund
the anc has enormous strengths and strong leadership he said but it must correct its deficiencies and renew itself to fight and win local elections expected late next year
only through being critical will we be able to ensure that we become an even stronger organization he said
ramaphosa said the anc had become too dependent on nelson mandela its president and the nation's first black president and a small coterie of top leaders
the organization must do a better job of delegating responsibility and building up a secondary layer of leaders especially now that many of its top members are in government he said
ramaphosa rejected talk of grassroots unhappiness with the anc and government saying people supported mandela's government in its bid to promote reconciliation between blacks and whites after apartheid
the conference had been expected to air complaints that mandela's government has been too slow to address black needs and too quick to accommodate whites but journalists covering the meeting on a university campus could detect few signs of any real dissatisfaction
we've been oppressed for 80 years and we've been in government for less than one year said churchman adams a delegate from port elizabeth i won't say even a word of complaint people still have confidence
opinion polls show mandela remains the country's most popular leader by far with his support increasing since his inauguration in may
opening the five-day conference saturday mandela defended his government but acknowledged some mistakes had been made and pledged tangible benefits for blacks in 1995
ramaphosa a former union leader who led anc negotiators in years of talks with former white leaders on ending apartheid said the anc had failed to properly prepare as an organization for the shift from opposition movement to governing party
little fiscal discipline exists with mandela serving as the only reliable money-raising tool he added
we do have financial difficulties we are still addressing the problems of the massive debt we have incurred after the elections said ramaphosa who declined to disclose the amount of money owed
also sunday the black nationalist pan africanist congress reelected clarence makwetu as its leader despite the group's poor showing in the april vote
the pac which calls for black majority rule and taking land from whites barely managed to gain a few seats in parliament and party hardliners criticized makwetu's leadership but delegates to a party conference gave makwetu a slim victory in voting for the pac presidency
while virtually powerless in the new government the pac represents a militant ideology attractive to young blacks and could benefit if the anc fails to deliver promised benefits to blacks
clad in a flak jacket former president jimmy carter rode into sarajevo on sunday to try mediate an end to the war a quest that has frustrated diplomats for more than 2 years
carter's motorcade headed at dusk down sniper alley the perilously exposed road from the airport to the city center a source in carter's escort said the caravan detoured around a stretch of the road that had been peppered hours earlier by rocket-propelled grenades
the grenades likely were fired by bosnian serbs their leader radovan karadzic invited carter who has successfully defused crises in north korea and haiti this year
there is widespread skepticism that carter will have similar success in the complex bosnian war many observers speculated that karadzic invited him only to undermine a peace proposal that diplomats have unsuccessfully pressured the bosnian serbs to accept
carter met late sunday with president alija izetbegovic and other officials of bosnia's muslim-led government on monday he was to travel to the headquarters of the insurgent bosnian serbs in pale near sarajevo
carter told reporters at the airport that he hoped to contribute to an easing of tensions based on pledges by karadzic to improve relations with the united nations and then hopefully see some movement toward a comprehensive cease-fire
karadzic promised last week to end a period of high tension between the united nations and bosnian serbs that followed three nato airstrikes a month ago nato launched the strikes after bosnian serbs violated a un protected zone
hundreds of peacekeepers were detained un movements were frozen and the sarajevo airport was closed it reopened with two un flights on saturday
before arriving in sarajevo carter stopped in zagreb capital of neighboring croatia which fought its own six-month war with serb rebels in 1991 he met there with president franjo tudjman and the bosnian prime minister haris silajdzic
many previous mediation efforts and cease-fires have failed in the bosnian war in which an estimated 200000 people are listed as dead or missing
the outline of central issues that carter will take up emerged in comments made by both sides as his visit began
bosnian government officials insisted the serbs accept the peace plan promulgated by the so-called contact group of the united states britain france russia and germany
the bosnian government has reluctantly accepted the plan which would leave the serbs with 49 percent of bosnia instead of the 70 percent they now hold the plan also would grant bosnian serbs no recognition of sovereignty or confederation with serbia
silajdzic said negotiations were possible once the serbs accept the plan once they accept the peace plan there are a lot of things we can talk about he said
that seemed to fit a subtle shift in the contact group approach that emerged earlier this month the plan was presented as non-negotiable this summer but the us representative charles thomas said recently that both sides could change anything they wanted by mutual consent
karadzic might consider agreeing to the framework of the plan to blunt international criticism but reserve acceptance of the details that would leave the combatants and the international community with agreement on a blank plan no further ahead than they are now
there is likely to be continued disagreement on bosnian serbs' demand for sovereignty that has emerged as a key bosnian serb demand in recent weeks
karadzic apparently wants sovereignty to secure his own position as his relations with slobodan milosevic the powerful serb president deteriorate bosnian serbs see carter's involvement as a way of opening up a direct link to washington their foes' biggest supporter that could be interpreted as de facto recognition
if america so decided the war in bosnia-herzegovina cold be over before new year said aleksa buha foreign minister of the self-proclaimed bosnian serb state if carter's arrival would make formal the recognition of the bosnian serbs' state then the major part of the work would be done
silajdzic stressed that was unacceptable and added of the carter visit i do not think that this is any kind of international recognition
there was more bad news from the battlefront sunday for the bosnian government
bosnian army officials confirmed reports that the key town of velika kladusa in northwest bosnia had fallen after weeks of attack by serbs and renegade muslims bosnian army officials in sarajevo said the remaining defenders had managed to pull out
the palm trees and stone walls of jerusalem were transformed into a winter wonderland monday as over a foot of snow blanketed the city shutting it down and cutting off access roads
snowballs flew across local roads trafficked only by a handful of cars and taxis the jerusalem-tel aviv highway was closed off some 12 miles west of the entrance of city
schools were closed throughout the city and outlying areas and no public transportation was running the radios urged citizens to stay home
maxim chernovsky 22 a recent immigrant from the former soviet union was one of the few residents to venture out by car
this snow is not a big deal for me and i definitely feel comfortable driving in it said chernovsky who had picked up five hitchhikers along his way to work i feel like a taxi driver
meanwhile most jerusalemites explored their transformed city by foot and with cameras in hand

in 1991 jorg hoffmann collected two world swim titles in perth on monday the german was controversially disqualified in the heats of the 200-meter freestyle
hoffmann 27 was thrown out of his heat after making one false start there were more than 10 false starts from 28 heats monday but hoffman was the only person disqualified
hoffmann asked by the associated press at the german team hotel later monday whether he felt he had been victimized replied yes
but he added i've been in this business too long to get angry it's his decision and i will try to keep going on
hoffmann said he had been singled out
i don't know what really happened said hoffmann who beat australia's kieren perkins to win the 1500-meter final here at the 1991 world titles
i did nothing else than some of the other guys in other heats i was hoping to start very quick to get a good time they disqualified me without any reason
german swimming federation's communication director gerd heydn said the only explanation given to hoffmann by the brazilian referee was that the swimmer's false start was a technical one
i think he feels there is a little bit of revenge being taken heydn said he's very disappointed because he thinks there is revenge from the drugs issue against him
hoffmann admitted recently that he had taken anabolic steroids for three weeks at the orders of his coaches in the old east germany but then stopped
hoffmann was in an angry mood immediately after the race
later monday hoffmann secured a place on the german 4-x-200-meter freestyle relay team in a swim-off against four of teammates
it was my aim to get a place in the relay and i have done that which is good said hoffmann who will also contest the 400-meters freestyle here
meanwhile german team captain chris-carol bremer on monday also questioned whether australia's samantha riley should have read the athlete's oath at the opening ceremony last wednesday
riley the reigning world 100- and 200-meter breaststroke champion tested positive in december 1995 for dextropropoxyphene contained in a headache tablet handed to her by coach scott volkers
she was given a stern warning by swimming's world governing body fina and the non performance-enhancing drug has since been removed from the international olympic committee's banned list
she tested positive not for steroids but still bremer said
there's some very good swimmers on your team there were a lot of other choices and you chose her to other countries we look at it and say what are
you accusing us of when you have her read the oath

a militant sunni muslim group claimed responsibility monday for the slaughter of 24 shiite muslims kneeling in prayer at a cemetery in lahore
in a message delivered to news outlets in lahore the secretive sunni muslim group lashkar-e-jhangvi _ warriors of jhangvi _ claimed responsibility for sunday's carnage
the group named for a sunni muslim militant killed years ago warned of further attacks on pakistan's minority shiite muslim community
we will not spare shiites in pakistan said the message
police in armored personnel carriers patrolled the streets as shiite muslims vowing revenge prepared to bury the victims of sunday's attack at nasir bagh park in the heart of the ancient capital of pakistan's punjab province
my party is in a position to seek an equal revenge against the terrorists said mohammed agha ali mausvi a spokesman for the militant tehrik-e-jafria or movement for shiite muslim law
his group called a one-day strike in lahore and declared three days of mourning and said another statement would come on tuesday
several shiite muslim leaders earlier blamed another sunni muslim group linked to previous assaults sipah-e-sahabah or the friends of the guardians of the prophet
the authorities have deployed hundreds of paramilitary soldiers around nasir bagh park where thousands of shiite muslims are expected to gather later on monday to bury the dead
the shiite community does not want to bury more people mausvi said but added that the government has failed to stop sectarian violence in pakistan
almost 300 people died in religiously motivated attacks in pakistan during 1997 most killings occur in punjab home to 60 percent of pakistan's 140 million people
the majority of pakistanis are sunni muslims who hold no grudge against their shiite brethren but small well-armed militant groups have emerged on both sides
the massacre came as nearly 100 shiite muslim worshipers were kneeling at the white marble grave of their former leader and teacher mohammed hussein rizwan during a ceremony marking his death two years ago from natural causes
prayer leader allama aktar abbas najvi had paused to offer a warning we must be very cautious he said we are not safe here in pakistan
moments later two gunmen on a motorcycle roared up and turned their rifles on the mourners killing 24 people and injuring more than 30
people scrambled for cover children hid behind the gravestones some beneath brightly-hued chadors or shrouds draped over the stone markers screams and pleas for the gunmen to stop filled the air
we were in the middle of our prayers said a trembling imam hassan 52 everyone started screaming and trying to find a place to hide but they just kept on firing
two accomplices kept watch from a jeep
police who took about an hour to get to the graveyard cordoned off the area the punjab government called an emergency meeting of law enforcement officials and ordered a judicial inquiry
we will find these terrorists whoever they are chief minister shahbaz sharif said
prime minister nawaz sharif called the attack inhuman
this time john elway didn't have to win the game for the denver broncos with one of those classic beat-the-clock drives this time he simply had to save it
look at his numbers for sunday's american football conference championship game against the pittsburgh steelers and they're nothing special _ 18 for 31 for 210 yards sort of ho-hum really except for that time when elway always does his best work the time when time is running out
half of those 18 completions came at the end of the first half and the end of the game when elway put on a clinic on how to manage time
he was 6-for-6 in a stunning five-minute stretch that produced the game-turning touchdowns at the end of the first half and 3-for-3 in the last three minutes of the game when the steelers were in position to snatch the game away from denver
pittsburgh had just narrowed the broncos' lead to 24-21 and with three rivers stadium rocking elway had a to find a way to keep the ball away from the steelers kill some seconds waste a fistful of those little ticks of the clock he has always embraced so warmly
everybody knew the situation that we just needed to get some first downs he said i'd like to say i had a lot to do with it but i had been saying that in the huddle four straight times and it didn't work the first three times
he protests a tad too much
elway started the sequence with an in-your-face first-down pass for 6 yards to ed mccaffrey a sort of statement pass that defied pittsburgh to do something about it
i had to be aggressive he said i had to throw the ball and make the first down you always stay aggressive and hope you get it done
on second-and-4 terrell davis lost a couple of yards leaving the broncos on their own 15-yard line at the two-minute warning and the steelers thinking this was going to turn out all right after all
elway sized up the situation and came up with something for the moment _ just the way he always seems to solve these crisis situations he said the play was improvised created on the fly the result was an 18-yard pass connection with shannon sharpe moments later he hit mccaffrey for 10 more and the steelers were done
the third-down play had been the key and elway knew it
they were coming after us all day he said they were coming from everywhere we needed something quick it was made up nothing that's in the game plan i took a chance i saw the linebacker drop off on shannon i got the ball to him
coach mike shanahan said the steelers' bump coverage on the play wasn't the best thing for the broncos' purposes elway thought it was just fine thank you it was perfect as far as i'm concerned he said
so was elway
he had put on two textbook drives at the end of the first half helped along by a pair of pass interference penalties against the shaken steelers secondary then after managing the clock to his benefit he killed it and pittsburgh with it
afterwards he seemed as proud of that clutch first down at the end as any sequence in a 15-year career that has bordered on brilliant and that includes the end-of-game 98-yard march to the tying touchdown against cleveland in the 1987 afc championship game a critical trip down the field that denver fans affectionately call the drive
elway was asked to compare the two
it's not nearly as dramatic but it had the same effect he said i think that was harder than the drive just because we had been struggling on offense especially in the second half we just needed to get a couple of first downs and sometimes that's tougher than getting points
nothing though ever seems that tough for elway the master of the clock and the dramatic
medical authorities said monday rift valley fever believed to be responsible for deaths of more than 300 kenyans claimed 21 more lives in northeastern kenya
the fever named after valley in kenya is spread by mosquitoes sand flies and during the slaughter of infected animals it causes high fevers severe headaches and vision problems and in severe cases fatal hemorrhaging from the nose and other orifices
dr saade abdala a red cross official in garissa said most of the recent victims got the virus from handling ailing livestock he said in shimbirey 320 kilometers 200 miles northeast of nairobi residents and livestock shared water from the same dams
he urged residents to burn all animal carcasses to prevent such contacts
tests were continuing at the us centers for disease control and prevention in atlanta and the national institute of virology in south africa to determine whether rift valley fever also was to blame for the deaths of hundreds of sheep goats and camels
the virus which is endemic to africa was first isolated in 1931 during an outbreak in livestock on a farm in kenya's rift valley it causes spontaneous abortions in ewes and cows
medical experts said there was no specific treatment for rift valley fever but patients benefit from rehydration and nourishment
the impoverished population is malnourished and ravaged by many diseases especially those spread by a lack of clean water and medical services
in addition severe flooding in northeastern kenya has widely scattered eggs laid by the mosquitoes at the edges of rivers
across the border in somalia dozens of people also died recently from rift valley fever exact figures were not available
in nearly 10 years as a muslim militant with the radical movement al-gamaa al-islamiya hasan sultan felt only hatred for christians now he has found a new life _ thanks to a christian businessman
i never spoke to christians when i was with al-gamaa sultan said
he belonged to one of the militants' enforcement gangs which beat up egypt's coptic christians and attacked their churches
sultan sat the other day with a christian friend sipping tea and smoking a water pipe _ an object he would once have smashed as un-islamic now 29 he owns a busy sandwich shop he started with a loan from hany rizk a wealthy coptic businessman
rizk's loan achieved more than sultan's success it provided the idea for a program that helps other militants return to mainstream lives _ albeit a tiny effort in light of the egypt's thousands of radical activists
sultan is typical of many people attracted to al-gamaa al-islamiya or the islamic group from the cairo slum of imbaba he was a poor youth with no future he took his anger out in karate training and joined the radical movement at 15
al-gamaa has waged a five-year campaign to unseat egypt's secular government and turn the country into an islamic republic more than 1200 people have died in the violence _ among them 58 foreign tourists gunned down in november near the southern tourist city of luxor
sultan was arrested in 1992 when police carried out a huge raid on his slum area because it was virtually being run by militants in prison he began rethinking his views
he said got into a fight with jailmates who were celebrating a militant bombing of a cairo cafe in 1993 that killed and wounded egyptians and foreigners he argued it was wrong to attack innocents
i told them what if my brother was there and got killed' he recalled
sultan like many jailed militants was never charged he was freed after a year and _ broke and jobless _ was thinking of rejoining al-gamaa then he met saad eddin ibrahim an egyptian sociologist who included sultan's story _ and sultan's hope of returning to ordinary society _ in a film about imbaba shown on egyptian television
rizk saw the show and offered to help lending sultan 1000 egyptian pounds or about dlrs 300 _ a year's income for many egyptians
sultan who is married and has two daughters opened his tiny imbaba star sandwich shop at crowded munira square in 1994
it is doing very well i bought a car and have nine employees in the shop which is open 24 hours a day sultan said as several students stood waiting for drinks and sandwiches
rizk said his loan provided not only a business opportunity but a way of life that sultan would never have known
not every poor person is a terrorist but most of the terrorists are poor he said the idea is to create for him an alternative opportunity that's the solution in my opinion
adopting that idea ibrahim the sociologist who heads a think tank called the ibn kaldoun center for development studies got a dlrs 10000 grant from finland and started a loan program for those wanting to leave radical pasts
sultan's success encouraged us to try a few more and with a few more again succeeding that encouraged us further ibrahim said
the reintegrating islamic militants program has now given out 37 loans 16 to former muslim extremists and others to victims of the radicals
ibrahim said the loans _ from 500 to 2000 pounds dlrs 150 to dlrs 600 _ are repaid in weekly or monthly installments most of the former militants have opened vegetable stands or similar street stalls but one has a small factory that makes children's clothes
the program is not without critics mokhtar nouh a lawyer who defends radicals says it is too small to be taken seriously as a way to fight islamic militancy
he also says that poverty _ the program's target _ is less important in turning people into radicals than is egypt's lack of democracy and many people's belief that the government is corrupt and cares little for the average citizen
ibrahim defends the loan program as a way to turn people away from violence
it is very successful and we measure success by two or three indicators _ not going back to violence running a successful business paying back their loans beginning to recommend others or help others ibrahim said
he said some former radicals have even recommended their coptic victims for loans
they confessed that in the height of their militancy they harassed and destroyed property of these copts he said in a way they were feeling a bit guilty

the leaders of japan and germany both telephoned their concerns monday adding to pressure on indonesia to honor promises to reform its shattered economy under the terms of a multibillion-dollar international bailout
japanese prime minister ryutaro hashimoto and german chancellor helmut kohl both telephoned president suharto about indonesia's economic crisis and plunging currency state secretariat minister murdiono said
murdiono the government's main spokesman gave no details of the conversations that followed talks between suharto and the deputy chief of the international monetary fund which put together the bailout plan
president bill clinton stressed the need for reform in a telephone conversation with suharto late last week when the rupiah plunged to a record low australian prime minister john howard did the same during the weekend
imf first deputy managing director stanley fischer emerged from talks with suharto monday hopeful that indonesia would soon announce strong reforms to restore market confidence
he stressed however that much more work with indonesian officials must be done in coming days to strengthen and accelerate the dlrs 40 billion imf rescue program financially backed by friendly governments
i expect that within a few days the government of indonesia will show in a very strong way its commitment to carrying out the program and undertaking a variety of measures that should restore confidence in the economy he said after meeting with suharto for about two hours
but there are many things going on at any particular time you can never be absolutely certain that you can turn confidence around in two minutes he told reporters
the imf bailout in response to indonesia's economic meltdown late last year came close to stalling last week when the government unveiled a budget lacking in reforms required under the plan
but i think the critical steps will be taken very soon too that should restore confidence to begin to restore confidence fischer said
fischer made his comments just hours before deputy us treasury secretary lawrence summers was due to arrive in jakarta to stress the need for sweeping reforms
fischer said further details of indonesia's plans would probably be announced after imf boss michel camdessus confers with suharto on thursday
finance minister marie muhammad described suharto's meeting with fischer as constructive later he posed for cameras holding a sign that read i love the rupiah at a money-changing ceremony with dozens of business people
they came to the office of indonesia's central bank and changed thousands of dollars in a demonstration of solidarity with government attempts to turn the currency around people doing the opposite buying dollars with rupiahs have sent the rupiah lower
on another side of town hundreds of people lined up for hours at a local market to buy cheap subsidized cooking oil from the back of government supply truck
i've been queuing since dawn one woman said
the government has been selling cheap food recently to counter big price rises following the rupiah's plunge which also triggered a wave of panic buying that emptied markets and stores last week
the imf put together its economic rescue program in october after big falls in the value of the rupiah but it failed to stop the slide
the currency sank to a record low of 10550 rupiahs to the us dollar last week amid fears that the package was coming unglued because indonesia had failed to live up to promises to overhaul its financial system and meet other agreed reforms
the rupiah was quoted at 8600 rupiah to the dollar in midday trading monday down from its friday close of 8075
russian prime minister viktor chernomyrdin is heading to turkmenistan to discuss the thorny question of gas exports from the former soviet central asian nation his office said monday
moscow wants to control these lucrative exports but turkmenistan already has teamed up with turkey and iran to create a regional network that would send gas to europe while bypassing russia
chernomyrdin would leave for turkmenistan tuesday for a day-long visit the premier's office said
the visit was due to take place in late december but was put off after the sides announced it had not been fully prepared the itar-tass news agency reported
at the same time turkmen president saparmurat niyazov and his iranian counterpart mohammed khatami on dec 29 formally launched a pipeline that would carry a relatively modest 5 billion cubic meters of natural gas a year from turkmenistan to iran
but both sides are hoping the 125-mile pipeline would become the first link in a much larger chain transporting turkmen gas to iran turkey and on to europe
the leaders of these three countries _ which see themselves as important players in the scramble to control the caspian's energy wealth _ have reached a preliminary agreement to the effect in december
the issue is vital for ashgabat which is desperately seeking a pipeline network to export its huge natural gas reserves before the iranian deal the country's only export pipeline ran through russia
chernomyrdin has argued prior to the visit that it would be much cheaper for turkmenistan to export its gas through russia
all this was calculated back in the soviet times the southern route would be 100 to 200 percent more expensive and it should be calculated what damages the state would suffer he said according to itar-tass
chernomyrdin also blamed unspecified third forces for acting against russian transit and for thwarting cooperation between caspian nations the report said
in spite of the russian premier's insistence his mission faces numerous problems
last year the joint turkmenrosgas venture formed by turkmenistan's state turkmenneftegaz corporation and russia's gazprom fell apart presently the sides cannot agree on the price of gas and on transit fees with turkmenistan saying the russian price is too high itar-tass noted
on the other hand turkmenistan's cooperation with iran is complicated by the prospect of us sanctions against parties involved in any major future projects for trans-iranian pipelines the pipeline launched in december would not be affected as the deal predated their enactment
the united states accuses iran of sponsoring international terrorism and does not want tehran to gain too much influence over the caspian resources and develop a stranglehold on the region's energy
when the caspian's energy resources are exploited to the full a prospect that is still decades away the region is expected to be second only to the middle east in energy production
so far regional wars political conflicts and financial feuds have slowed or prevented many projects from getting off the ground
hong kong shares rose slightly at the opening of afternoon trading monday but the main index stayed below a key support level it breached in the morning session
forty-five minutes into the afternoon session the key hang seng index was at 798887 points down 90577 or 10 percent the tumble came on top of a nearly 17 percent drop last week
the market's dive began immediately after it opened with the index dropping 9 percent to 808010 points in the first five minutes and staying close to 8000 after that
shares were dragged down by rising interest rates and reports that major hong kong-based investment bank peregrine investment holdings ltd will liquidate
the future of peregrine has been in doubt since zurich centre investments ltd abandoned plans last week to take a 24 percent stake in the troubled company
peregrine is heavily exposed in indonesia where it lent a substantial amount to a cab company steady safe the company's ability to repay the loan appeared in doubt following a massive drop last week in the value of the indonesian currency the rupiah
hong kong regulators said they are monitoring the situation at the investment bank
the stock exchange is also in contact with peregrine investments holdings ltd for information about the latest situation of the company said henry law spokesman for the stock exchange of hong kong
the exchange has set up a hot line for concerned investors
rapidly rising interest rates were also a major factor depressing the market analysts said
banks raised the prime lending rate on which mortgages are based by 075 percentage point on friday to 1025 percent
interbank lending rates rose monday to as high as 18 percent
concerns that the hong kong dollar may come under speculative attack were adding to tension on the market dealers said
but the dollar appeared to be defying the fears trading slightly stronger against the us dollar at 77430 compared to friday's 77458
hong kong officials repeatedly have declared they will defend the dollar from speculative attack the hong kong dollar is pegged to the us dollar the last surviving peg in a major asian economy
the market's drop was reflected especially strongly in the price of property stocks about 70 percent of hong kong stocks are tied to property
shares in blue-chip property giant new world development co fell 23 percent to an intraday low of 16 hong kong dollars
blue-chip banking and china shares also declined sharply british bank hsbc holdings plc was down 11 hong kong dollars to 15700 hong kong dollars
sentiment is still very weak said ben kwong research director at dharmala securities co
the market was mainly driven by sentiment not by fundamentals said kwong
an armed gang attacked a village outside algiers and slaughtered up to 100 people overnight most of them in a movie theater hospital sources said monday
the attack sunday was one of the bloodiest massacres outside the capital during a muslim insurgency and marked the beginning of the conflict's seventh year
more than 75000 people have died in the insurgency at least 1000 alone since the start of the holy month of ramadan on dec 30 prompting international calls for an investigation
the attack in sidi ahmed in the so-called triangle of death about 20 kms 12 miles south of algiers began shortly after evening prayers according to survivors hospitalized in algiers
as the cinema began screening a film a gang leader yelled you should be in the mosque for the prayer of the taraouih a ramadan prayer the survivors recounted on condition of anonymity
the gang of about 100 men broke into three groups the largest of which attacked the theater shooting slashing and hacking their victims the witnesses said
most of the victims were young said a nurse at mustapha hospital the hospital sources speaking on condition of anonymity put the death toll at about 100 while the newspaper liberte reported dozens killed
the government often reluctant to report violence had yet to confirm the massacre
army troops who arrived in the village shortly after the attack transported the victims to algiers hospitals it was not clear if the military had intervened with the gang
in the worst single episode of carnage in six years more than 400 people were reported killed in three villages around the western town of relizane near chekala as ramadan began the evening of dec 30
the insurgency began after the military-backed government on jan 11 1992 canceled elections the islamic salvation front was tipped to win on voter discontent with corruption and high unemployment in the petroleum-rich nation
the front on sunday lashed out at the government of president liamine zeroual and demanded an independent investigation of recent massacres
the front whose military wing is maintaining a truce with the army also urged a serious national dialogue capable of ending the bloodbath and bringing a return to peace it called on the government to release or lift restrictions on its leaders
the front decried a total lack of security in the entire country
just who is behind the killings in algeria remains at least partly a mystery
some islamic militant factions claim government forces are staging massacres of civilians algerian officials contend the violence is the fault of the militants especially the most violent faction the armed islamic group
zeroual has rejected calls in recent days by europe and the united states for an investigation of the killings
an algerian policeman seeking asylum in britain said he participated in the massacre and torture of defenseless civilians under orders the observer newspaper reported sunday
the unidentified policeman and a colleague were quoted by the british newspaper as saying that army special forces disguised as islamic fundamentalists with beards and muslim dress slaughtered entire families in the middle of the night
the observer said the two policemen gave detailed evidence of the state's involvement in a whole range of human rights abuses massacres by military security death squads torture of the regime's opponents spying and the murder of difficult journalists and popular entertainers
indonesian soldiers killed two rebels in a gunbattle in a remote corner of the disputed territory of east timor a newspaper reported monday
the rebels identified as martinho alias manas and crispin masa were killed friday at buatete village in ermera district 80 kilometers 50 miles south of east timor's capital of dili the daily kompas said
the military in dili said monday it was investigating the report
the paper quoted district chief konstantino soares as saying the two were among 25 rebels who fought indonesian troops on patrol the others escaped he said
two horses used by the rebels along with two radio sets and ammunition were captured kompas said
also friday another indonesian patrol captured two other rebels identified as domingos babua lete and salestino in bobonaro a district about 70 kilometers 44 miles southwest of dili it said
indonesia annexed east timor a former portuguese colony in 1976 a year after its troops intervened in a civil war that broke out as portugal abandoned the colony
the united nations however does not recognize indonesian rule in the half-island territory where a small group of east timorese guerrillas is still fighting for independence
president clinton will move to waive trade restrictions on communist vietnam by early february us sen john kerry said monday
kerry speaking to the american business community in the vietnamese capital hanoi said the clinton administration will ask congress for a waiver to the jackson-vanik amendment within weeks
the legislation restricts trade with communist countries but a waiver would clear the way for normalized trade ties with vietnam opening the door for most-favored-nation trade status and aid benefits
i think i can say with considerable confidence the president will make the recommendation that jackson-vanik be waived kerry said if i can go out on a limb i think we can expect this by the end of the month or early february
in december the white house said it would pursue the waiver but did not specify a time
kerry in vietnam on a weeklong mission to explore business and trade ties said he learned of the president's intentions through discussions with secretary of state madeleine albright and national security adviser sandy burger
although the united states lifted its trade embargo on vietnam four years ago full trade relations have been blocked by the jackson-vanik amendment
the clinton administration is apparently satisfied with efforts by hanoi to liberalize its emigration policy _ a prerequisite for the jackson-vanik waiver
kerry a democrat from massachusetts has been a longtime advocate of normalized political and commercial ties with one-time enemy vietnam
although he has been encouraging american business interests here the senator also said vietnam was at a critical juncture in its market-oriented reform process known as doi moi
they are in a make or break situation in the near term kerry said of vietnam's reforms this is the moment of test for vietnam it's a time to test whether doi moi will take hold
although vocally committed to continued reform vietnam's senior communist party leadership is debating how much change it will tolerate
many conservative communists say hanoi has given away too much of its economic control by liberalizing its investment markets and selling off state-controlled enterprise
in our meetings with the leadership we make it clear that this is the time for some clear choices kerry said we want to make it clear that vietnam must continue its forward progress
kerry was scheduled to meet with premier phan van khai late monday and travel to ho chi minh city on tuesday
when chanda rubin won the longest women's match in australian open history two years ago beating arantxa sanchez vicario to reach the semifinals the american seemed on the brink of stardom
rubin 19 at the time had the all-court game the quickness and the strength that could launch her to the top of the rankings she just didn't have the luck
a fractured bone in her right hand two months after the australian sidelined her until june then she could manage only one set before the pain forced her out again when more rest didn't help she underwent surgery that september and took another two months to heal
rubin's comeback since then has been spotty a fourth-round showing last year in the australian a second-round exit from the french and first-round knockouts at wimbledon and the us open
on monday at the sydney international rubin got the kind of confidence-booster she's needed to take the next step looking as sharp as ever she blew away germany's anke huber the no 8 seed 6-2 6-3 in a first-round match
that's a good win for me to start off the year rubin said i feel i can compete with anyone and i definitely think i'm close to being up with the best but you can be close for a long time to get to that point you have to be mentally tough battle and fight consistently i need more wins like this one
rubin's 3-hour 33-minute marathon against sanchez vicario at the 1996 australian was the epitome of toughness mental and physical if rubin ranked no 31 can stay healthy and regain that dogged spirit she can be a threat to anyone including no 1 martina hingis
anna kournikova the 16-year-old russian who trains in florida won her first-round match by default monday she led 6-4 3-0 when indonesian yayuk basuki retired with a back injury
in the first men's match sweden's thomas enqvist scored a 6-7 8-6 6-4 6-4 victory over spain's carlos moya a finalist here and at the australian open last year
he's one of the toughest unseeded players i could play in the first round said moya the no 3 seed sometimes you are lucky sometimes unlucky
moya said he's not playing as well or as confidently as a year ago
i'm playing close matches but i'm not winning he said last year it was different i was playing close matches and winning them i know sooner or latter that will have to change i'm just not concentrating i'm thinking i've already won the match when i'm one set up and a break it's happening more often than i would like the last four matches i've lost i was up in three of them
in other first-round men's matches monday scott draper of australia hendrik dreekman and francisco clavet of spain advanced
in women's first-rounders no 6 conchita martinez of spain sandrine testud of france and natasha zvereva of bulgaria won as did american chanda rubin in a 6-2 6-3 upset of no 8 anke huber of germany
as senior officials from the united states and the international monetary fund launched an emergency effort to calm east asia's economic turmoil hong kong's stock market became the latest victim falling sharply monday
rattled by rising interest rates reports that a major hong kong-based investment bank may shut down and the sharp decline on wall street on friday the key hang seng index had tumbled 10 percent or 90577 points to 798887 by early afternoon
last week the index dropped nearly 17 percent
a hong kong bank clerk chau ho-yeung said his 70000 hong kong dollar investment dlrs 8970 was now worth about 10000 hong kong dollars dlrs 1282
i'm expecting the worst i've lost everything and i'm now only holding on to a pile of wastepaper chau said
share prices also were falling in singapore japan taiwan malaysia and australia
but share prices were rising on the stock markets of two of the region's most troubled economies indonesia and south korea
in hong kong the stock market was rattled by doubts over the future of peregrine investment holdings ltd which surfaced when zurich centre investments ltd abandoned plans last week to take a 24 percent stake in the troubled company
peregrine is heavily exposed in indonesia where it lent a substantial amount of money to a company whose ability to repay it was thrown into doubt following a massive decline last week in the value of the indonesian currency the rupiah
on friday there was a sharp decline on wall street because of growing concern over asia's economic turmoil which began last summer and has since forced the imf to give large bailout loans to thailand indonesia and south korea
in new york the dow jones industrial average plummeted 282 percent or 22020 points closing friday at 758042 its fourth-worst single-session point loss in history
such concerns prompted stanley fischer the imf's first deputy managing director to begin talks sunday with officials in indonesia on its dlrs 40 billion imf-led rescue package
last week the bailout came close to stalling when the government unveiled a budget short of reforms the plan required
but fischer emerged from two hours of talks with president suharto on monday hopeful that indonesia would soon announce strong reforms to overcome its economic crisis
i expect that within a few days the government of indonesia will show in a very strong way its commitment to carrying out the program and undertaking a variety of measures that should restore confidence in the economy fischer said
also monday deputy us treasury secretary lawrence summers was to arrive in jakarta to stress the need for the sweeping reforms
summers who also will visit thailand malaysia china south korea and japan began his journey in singapore on sunday
later this week the imf managing director michel camdessus and the us defense secretary william cohen also will travel to indonesia in an effort to bolster faith in its economy
such efforts appeared to begin to pay off monday when share prices rose on the jakarta stock exchange in moderate trading by the midday break the composite index was up 8971 points or 26 percent at 351761
in seoul share prices on the korea stock exchange closed higher on strong buying interest from local investors encouraged by continued bullishness by foreigners analysts said
the benchmark index closed at 45620 up 1542 points or 243 percent
camdessus's remarks today that he is satisfied with korea's reform measures helped boost investor sentiment said kang sung-mo an analyst at hanjin investment and securities co
upon arrival at kimpo airport camdessus said yes when asked whether he is content with reforms made so far by south korea as conditions of the imf's dlrs 57 billion bailout
but prices fell on other stock exchanges in asia monday
in tokyo the 225-issue nikkei stock average shed 33066 points or 221 percent closing at 1466444
taiwan's main stock index fell to a 10-week low at the close plunging 36206 points or 47 percent to 737514
in australia the broadest market measure of share prices the all ordinaries index fell to its lowest level since late december shedding 607 points or 23 percent to 25424
at the end of the morning session in singapore the benchmark straits times industrials index in singapore was 10469 lower at 107166 breaching the 1100 level and in malaysia the composite index which tracks share prices of 100 blue-chip stocks was at 47474 down 1686 points or 34 percent
the us dollar was trading at 13228 yen on the tokyo foreign exchange market at 5 pm 0800 gmt monday up 090 yen from late friday
good and bad assets from 56 insolvent finance companies shut down last month will be separated by the end of january in a massive liquidation
the chairman of the financial restructuring authority the government body assigned to save what remains of the companies predicted monday that most bad assets will be sold off by year-end
amaret sila-on told a news conference that procedures of the sale are still being decided but that assets will be disposed of in open bidding
the authority estimates that more than half of the combined assets of 920 billion baht dlrs 1745 billion are non-performing
liquidation of the companies is a key condition _ along with a massive recapitalization of the banking sector _ of a dlrs 172 billion economic rescue package organized by the international monetary fund
finance minister tarrin nimmanhaeminda has said that the good assets of the companies are expected to be managed by one or two new banks being set up by his ministry
a lack of confidence in thailand's financial institutions is a major factor in the continuing fall of the baht which has lost more than 50 percent of its value since it was floated july 2

us company oxbow power services inc said monday it hopes to receive final approval by the end of march to proceed with a power plant project in northern vietnam
the privately held company was chosen two years ago to develop a dlrs 360 million coal-fired power plant in the northern province of quang ninh but is still waiting for its project license
the plant was scheduled to be running by the end of the year 2000 but is expected to take 30 months to build and so may not be completed on time
massachusetts-based raytheon international inc will handle construction on the project
oxbow executive vice president kenneth kerr told dow jones newswires that the agreements for the land lease and coal supply with state-owned coal company vinacoal are almost finished
kerr is in vietnam with us sen john kerry on a fact-finding mission on business opportunities here
the 300-megawatt power plant will be constructed as a build-operate-transfer project with control of the facility passing to vietnam at a future date
a quake measuring 35 to 4 hit the island of paramushir in russia's far east before dawn monday officials said no casualties or damage were reported
the tremor's epicenter was located 125 kilometers 77 miles northeast of paramushir situated in the northern part of the kuril chain the emergency situations ministry reported
tremors measuring 3 to 4 were felt in the town of severo-kurilsk on the island the ministry added
a sudanese official arrived in cairo on monday to prepare for an egyptian-sudanese summit aimed at improving relations between the two countries
mustafa osman ismail the sudanese minister of state for foreign affairs was to meet with egyptian foreign minister amr moussa later monday
he did not speak to reporters on arrival at cairo international airport
relations between egypt and sudan have been strained since 1989 when lt gen omar el-bashir took power in a military coup and installed an islamic regime
they reached their lowest point in 1995 after egypt accused sudan of involvement in an assassination attempt against president hosni mubarak in addis ababa ethiopia mubarak was not hurt in the attack
sudan has denied the allegations
mubarak and el-bashir last met in cairo in 1996 on the sidelines of an arab summit in an attempt to patch up the rift nothing came of the meeting but recent weeks have seen conciliatory remarks on both sides
ismail on jan 2 said he expected relations to be fully normalized this year while moussa said in an interview earlier this month that he believed sudan was taking egypt's security concerns into consideration
in addition to involvement in the attack on mubarak egypt has accused sudan of supporting muslim extremists who have waged a campaign of violence since the spring of 1992 to try to overthrow egypt's secular government and replace it with strict islamic rule
last month a top egyptian security official delivered a message from mubarak to el-bashir in the sudanese capital khartoum details of the message were not released mae-eap
china won the gold medal monday in the men's three-meter synchronized dive at the world swimming championships ahead of germany and australia

roy shannon and dean puller of australia took the bronze with a score of 30516
it was the second medal in the diving pool for australia after chantelle

prime minister chuan leekpai turned out monday to be the pauper of his cabinet with only 35 million baht dlrs 71400 in assets as a sitting thai government publicly declared its wealth for the first time ever
his cabinet is also poorer than that of his predecessor chavalit yongchaiyudh its members' assets were revealed in december a month after chavalit resigned because of the country's economic crisis
chuan's 49 ministers averaged 199 million baht dlrs 36 million in assets while chavalit's ministers averaged 612 million baht dlrs 111 million
but as in chavalit's cabinet the wives of chuan's ministers were frequently wealthier than their husbands
chuan's wife for instance had assets worth 67 million baht dlrs 121000 nearly twice as much as the prime minister
in september thailand passed a new constitution aimed at reducing corruption and increasing transparency it requires politicians to reveal their wealth to the counter corruption commission
one commission investigator speaking on condition of anonymity told the associated press that corruption was the chief cause of thailand's severe economic problems
last year the speaker of the house of representatives said that 50 percent of the government budget was being siphoned off by graft
thailand has been struggling through a financial crisis that triggered economic problems across asia and required a dlrs 172 billion bailout from the international monetary fund
its ripples have been felt as far away as wall street where the us stock market plunged friday over fears asian economies may collapse
several economists have attributed asia's economic problems and the inability to foresee them partly to a lack of transparency on debt levels and economic data
but greed has also been a factor while common thai people have been donating dollars in a campaign to boost foreign exchange reserves and the country has begged for bailouts the taxes ministers and their families have been paying are extremely low
chavalit's wife with 141 million baht dlrs 25 million in assets paid no taxes on grounds that she is a housewife
investigators said putting assets in a spouse's name is one way of hiding wealth
economists have expressed more faith in the chuan government's ability to revive the economy than they did in chavalit's which had a reputation for corruption
still like chavalit's cabinet chuan's has its share of extremely wealthy ministers
topping the list is deputy finance minister potiphong lamsam a member of a prominent family of bankers potiphong declared 1324 billion baht dlrs 24 million in assets
he was followed by deputy university affairs minister decha sukaran with 1322 billion baht dlrs 24 million and deputy minister of transport pradit pataronpasit with 958 million baht dlrs 174 million
pradit's wife had 142 billion baht dlrs 25 million in assets she paid only 24456 baht dlrs 444 in taxes
the chuan government will have to declare its assets again when it leaves office a commission investigator said probes would be launched at that time if there are unusual increases in wealth
the counter corruption commission has been a largely toothless tiger with few politicians being prosecuted for wrongdoing
investigators said however that the new constitution had strengthened the commission and although it will take five to 10 years they believe they can seriously reduce graft
when rusty smith blazed the first half of the men's pursuit at the us olympic short track speedskating trials in world-record time andy gabel didn't even flinch
sure at 18 smith is a ball of energy and a rising star but at the ripe old age of 33 there isn't much that gabel hasn't seen in the fast-paced sport so he wasn't all that concerned
rusty actually helped me said gabel i saw what he did and i think he went out a little too hard it kind of helped me judge my race a little bit
actually it probably helped a lot gabel a three-time olympian finished the 1000-meter time trial sunday night three seconds faster than he'd ever gone before and set a national record he finished in 1 minute 28416 seconds eclipsing the old mark of 129180 set in 1995 by tony goskowicz
smith who said he had expected to win that race came back to win the final and forge a two-way tie with gabel atop the men's standings with eight points
smith trailing in fifth place in the first few laps of the final knew he had to make a move before somebody broke away he did so midway through
i tried to go as quiet as i could on the outside so no one would hear me said smith i think i did a pretty good job
despite a warning from gabel's coach smith surged to the front of the pack with a driving four strokes down a straightaway twice the normal number of strides and won easily in 131984
when three-time olympian eric flaim kip carpenter and mike kooreman got tangled up and crashed together into the boards with three laps to go smith and gabel cruised to the finish in that order
he surprised me smith said of gabel the oldest of the 29 men competing for the olympic team he's been around for a really long time and he knows what he's doing but i did not expect him to have the speed that he has right now

the man was picked up in an arrest sweep the haaretz daily said
the haaretz report based on unidentified foreign sources said the syrian had worked with yehuda gil a mossad agent awaiting trial for fabricating reports that syria was preparing for war with israel
haaretz said the syrian contact was close to the syrian government and met with gil several times in europe over the past 21 years
gil 63 was arrested two months ago and has been indicted on charges of fraud embezzlement and passing information to the israeli spy agency with intent to damage state security
twice gil's false information reportedly sparked tensions between the two countries once in 1980 and again in 1996 when gil claimed that syrian military maneuvers were preparations for a syrian retaking of the strategic golan heights according to the haaretz report gil said his information came from the syrian source now under arrest in syria

facing mounting criticism of his policies prime minister ryutaro hashimoto appealed monday for public support of plans to stabilize japan's shaken financial system and turn around a sluggish economy
in an annual speech at the opening session of parliament hashimoto reiterated a pledge not to allow japan to trigger a global economic or financial panic
i am strongly determined to stabilize the financial system which is the economy's main artery and restore confidence in the outlook for our economy he said
hashimoto outlined among other measures a 30 trillion yen dlrs 231 billion plan to shore up confidence in the banking system by infusing financial institutions with funds needed to refurbish depleted capital reserves
a bill containing the proposal is expected to be submitted to parliament during the current five-month session along with other legislation such as a controversial plan to strengthen defense ties with the united states a blueprint for restructuring japan's trenchant central bureaucracy is also slated for debate
immediately following hashimoto's remarks finance minister hiroshi mitsuzuka presented a list of planned measures to cope with the economic problems confronting the nation
the finance minister's thunderous oratory was apparently not stirring enough to arouse hashimoto who slumped in his seat and appeared to doze off during the address
the weary prime minister marked the second anniversary of his administration sunday but has had little to celebrate amid a slump in his cabinet's popularity ratings and with a number of tough policy decisions still pending
it remains unclear for example exactly what criteria will need to be met by financial institutions eager to receive money under the government's rescue plan
the package has been criticized by opposition politicians as a taxpayer-funded bailout of badly managed banks
hashimoto has also come under fire from political opponents and leaders in the japanese business community for not proposing deeper tax cuts than a 2 trillion yen dlrs 154 billion plan he reluctantly offered last month
in his speech the prime minister hinted more tax relief could be forthcoming if the economy doesn't improve
in order to deal quickly with changes in economic and financial conditions and in accordance with the international state of affairs it is only natural that we consider fiscal and tax measures deemed necessary he said
the cabinet's approval ratings have fallen to around 35 percent according to recent newspaper surveys down from well over 50 percent two years ago when hashimoto took office
despite the apparent drop in public support hashimoto faces no immediate danger of losing his grip on power his liberal democratic party has a majority in the powerful lower house of parliament and no challenger has emerged from within the party cd-jc

the russian investigator handling the case ruslan tamayev said a letter seeking kozlyonok's extradition was sent to greek authorities friday the interfax news agency reported

russian government claims golden ada sold the metals and gems without permission and used the money to bankroll a buying spree that included property yachts luxury cars and a mansion some of the property was seized by the us internal revenue service

an armed gang attacked a village outside algiers and slaughtered dozens of people overnight most of them in a movie theater while dozens more died in an attack on a nearby mosque hospital sources said monday
from 70 to 100 people were reported killed
the two separate attacks sunday about 20 kms 12 miles from algiers were the bloodiest in the region of the capital since a series of attacks in august and september that left hundreds dead
there was no immediate claim of responsibility for the latest attacks centered on a movie theater in sidi ahmed and a mosque in nearby haouche sahraoui but suspicion fell on islamic insurgents whose battle to topple the military-backed government was moving into its seventh year
more than 75000 people have died in the conflict at least 1000 alone since the start of the holy month of ramadan on dec 30 prompting international calls for an investigation
the attack in sidi ahmed in the so-called triangle of death began shortly after evening prayers according to survivors hospitalized in algiers and the newspaper liberte in a report on the attacks
as the cinema began screening a film a gang leader yelled you should be in the mosque for the prayer of the taraouih a ramadan prayer the survivors recounted on condition of anonymity
the gang of about 100 men broke into three groups the largest of which attacked the theater shooting slashing and hacking their victims the witnesses said
another gang concentrated on the mosque in haouche sahraoui several kilometers away where a bomb exploded killing many of the faithful inside those managing to flee the mosque were met outside by automatic gunfire witnesses said
about 40 of the dead were at the morgue at zenirli hospital in suburban algiers and about 30 at algiers' mustapha hospital medical sources said
but survivors and hospital sources reported even more dead _ up to 100
most of the victims were young said a nurse at mustapha hospital

dow jones newswires quoting an unidentified source at peregrine reported monday that it will shut down nearly all operations after failing to find a buyer
on friday there was a sharp decline on wall street because of growing concern over asia's economic turmoil which began last summer and has since forced the imf to give large bailout loans to thailand indonesia and south korea
in new york the dow jones industrial average plummeted 282 percent or 22020 points closing friday at 758042 its fourth-worst single-session point loss in history
such concerns prompted stanley fischer the imf's first deputy managing director to begin talks sunday with officials in indonesia on its dlrs 40 billion imf-led rescue package
last week the bailout came close to stalling when the government unveiled a budget short of reforms the plan required
but fischer emerged from two hours of talks with president suharto on monday hopeful that indonesia would soon announce strong reforms to overcome its economic crisis
i expect that within a few days the government of indonesia will show in a very strong way its commitment to carrying out the program and undertaking a variety of measures that should restore confidence in the economy fischer said
also monday deputy us treasury secretary lawrence summers was to arrive in jakarta to stress the need for the sweeping reforms summers who also will visit thailand malaysia china south korea and japan began his journey in singapore on sunday

russia's top prosecutor pledged monday to complete a probe into the so-called book scandal which implicated senior government officials including first deputy premier anatoly chubais
prosecutor general yuri skuratov said chief figures in the affair already have been questioned and experts at present were working on some technical details the interfax news agency reported
the shady book deal led president boris yeltsin to fire three officials close to chubais last november
the president said he would keep chubais his government's chief economic policymaker but ousted him from the less important post of finance minister
chubais headed russia's unpopular post-soviet privatization program which many russians view as enriching kremlin insiders at the expense of ordinary citizens
the scandal erupted last fall when it became known that the officials chubais included had accepted advances of dlrs 90000 each for an unfinished book about russia's privatization program
the payments came from a publisher linked to oneximbank a major russian bank that won two key privatization auctions last year that victory had set off a firestorm of criticism from the losing bidders who charged that the auctions were rigged
communists and other critics then alleged that book payments to chubais and others were effectively bribes
chubais denies legal wrongdoing and has filed libel suits against two journalists who reported on the case
skuratov the prosecutor said experts plan to examine the manuscript of the book in question to determine its literary value

the destruction from saturday's earthquake in hebei province north of beijing was worse than initially reported although the casualty count held steady _ 50 dead 11440 people injured 1200 of them seriously _ estimates of damage to homes soared as rescue workers reached more communities in the hilly remote region
disaster relief officials in hebei reported that the 62 magnitude quake flattened 103000 houses and a provincial spokesman said another 130000 houses were too damaged to live in the state-run xinhua news agency said some 542000 people had been injured or left homeless by the quake
state television showed people sleeping on straw under thick quilts in large canvas tents with campfires burning outside as nighttime temperatures dropped to minus 20 celsius minus 4 fahrenheit
in many villages yet to receive relief supplies families too scared to return to their cracked or listing mud stone and brick homes slept in haystacks or under makeshift lean-tos
doctors were struggling without adequate medicine or medical facilities to treat the injured xinhua said many suffered broken limbs or were burned or scalded by fires caused by the quake
more food also was needed it cited the civil affairs ministry as saying

the leaders of japan and germany both telephoned their concerns monday adding to pressure on indonesia to honor promises to reform its shattered economy under the terms of a multibillion-dollar international bailout
also monday a special us envoy arrived in jakarta to press for economic reform after president suharto met with the deputy chief of the international monetary fund
japanese prime minister ryutaro hashimoto and german chancellor helmut kohl both telephoned president suharto about indonesia's economic crisis and plunging currency state secretariat minister murdiono said
in tokyo hashimoto said suharto told him that jakarta will comply with the economic reforms required by the imf-led bailout plan
suharto repeated his pledge in a meeting earlier with imf deputy chief stanley fischer according to murdiono the government's main spokesman
president clinton stressed the need for reform in a telephone conversation with suharto late last week when the rupiah plunged to a record low australian prime minister john howard did the same during the weekend
fischer emerged from talks with suharto hopeful that indonesia would soon announce strong reforms to restore market confidence
he stressed however that much more work with indonesian officials must be done in coming days to strengthen and accelerate the dlrs 40 billion imf rescue program financially backed by friendly governments
i expect that within a few days the government of indonesia will show in a very strong way its commitment to carrying out the program and undertaking a variety of measures that should restore confidence in the economy he said after meeting with suharto for about two hours
but there are many things going on at any particular time you can never be absolutely certain that you can turn confidence around in two minutes he told reporters
the imf bailout in response to indonesia's economic meltdown late last year came close to stalling last week when the government unveiled a budget lacking in reforms required under the plan
but i think the critical steps will be taken very soon too that should restore confidence to begin to restore confidence fischer said
hours later deputy us treasury secretary lawrence summers arrived in jakarta to stress the need for sweeping reforms
fischer said further details of indonesia's plans would probably be announced after imf boss michel camdessus confers with suharto on thursday
finance minister marie muhammad described suharto's meeting with fischer as constructive later he posed for cameras holding a sign that read i love the rupiah at a money-changing ceremony with dozens of business people
they came to the office of indonesia's central bank and changed thousands of dollars in a demonstration of solidarity with government attempts to turn the currency around people doing the opposite buying dollars with rupiahs have sent the rupiah lower
on another side of town hundreds of people lined up for hours at a local market to buy cheap subsidized cooking oil from the back of government supply truck
i've been queuing since dawn one woman said
the government has been selling cheap food recently to counter big price rises following the rupiah's plunge which also triggered a wave of panic buying that emptied markets and stores last week
the imf put together its economic rescue program in october after big falls in the value of the rupiah but it failed to stop the slide
the currency sank to a record low of 10550 rupiahs to the us dollar last week amid fears that the package was coming unglued because indonesia had failed to live up to promises to overhaul its financial system and meet other agreed reforms
the rupiah was quoted at 8600 rupiah to the dollar in midday trading monday down from its friday close of 8075

georgian president eduard shevardnadze on monday called on the international community to use force to end the five-year old conflict in the breakaway province of abkhazia as it did in bosnia
if the negotiation process does not bring any results and no results have been achieved during the last five years then the use of force to ensure peace would be absolutely justified shevardnadze said in a regular radio address
bosnia where concrete results have been achieved could serve as an example he said
the statement which followed years of fruitless talks with abkhazian separatists pushing for full independence appeared aimed at forcing them to make concessions and agree to bow to some degree of georgian control
abkhazian rebels seized the lush black sea province in a bloody 1992-1993 war which turned some 300000 ethnic georgians into refugees only about 30000 to 40000 refugees have been able to come home as abkhazian officials have balked at their return and shevardnadze has been under strong pressure to solve the crisis
georgia has urged russia which has deployed a peacekeeping force in the region to intensify its mediation efforts western nations so far largely have left it to russia to mediate in the conflict although an international council to deal with the crisis was set up in geneva last year
in his radio address shevardnadze called on the united nations' security council to provide legal framework for steps to help establish peace in the secessionist region
in bosnia the international community has demonstrated that it would not reconcile with aggressive separatism and its temporary victory' he said the actions of separatists in abkhazia amount to a cynical attack against the international community
shevardnadze said that unlike bosnia abkhazia should not be divided into ethnic enclaves
last fall the leaders of georgia and abkhazia held several unprecedented meetings in what was most serious attempt since the war to reach a peace settlement
there has been little progress however on the key issue of abkhazia's status the separatists demand sovereignty while the georgian government says abkhazia should settle for broad autonomy as part of georgia

peregrine's efforts to find a buyer failed and that became clear last week when zurich centre investments ltd abandoned plans to take a 24 percent stake in the troubled company
hong kong's chief executive tung chee-hwa on monday called peregrine another victim of asia's financial turmoil

such concerns prompted stanley fischer the imf's first deputy managing director to begin talks sunday with officials in indonesia on its dlrs 40 billion imf-led rescue package
last week the bailout came close to stalling when the government unveiled a budget short of reforms the plan required
but fischer emerged from two hours of talks with president suharto on monday hopeful that indonesia would soon announce strong reforms to overcome its economic crisis
i expect that within a few days the government of indonesia will show in a very strong way its commitment to carrying out the program and undertaking a variety of measures that should restore confidence in the economy fischer said

wall street's plunge friday also had little effect on manila shares as investors were too busy picking up oversold stocks
as to whether this is sustainable or not i really doubt it since nothing has changed said garcia
garcia said the philippine economy continues to be hounded by political uncertainty as may 1998 elections near bleak economic prospects with fears of massive layoffs high interest and inflation rates and an unstable currency
the continued strength of the peso against the dollar monday provided some solace to manila shares the peso averaged 44073 pesos per dollar compared to 44558 pesos friday
dealers said the thai baht's record low against the dollar monday had relatively little impact on the peso
monday was the third consecutive trading day of gains for the peso after the central bank implemented currency risk protection for unhedged corporate dollar borrowers prior to the start heavy speculative demand for dollars pushed the peso to new lows against the us currency
under the new so-called non-deliverable forward facility corporate borrowers can lock into a pre-determined exchange rate traders said the system has substantially reduced demand for dollars from corporate borrowers
thousands of protesters on monday headed into the capital of montenegro where a top us envoy was also expected to try and defuse a conflict that could lead to yet more bloodshed in the balkans
tensions have soared in montenegro since milo djukanovic won presidential elections last october current president and bitter foe momir bulatovic has said he doesn't recognize the result and called for mass open-ended protests against it
waving flags and chanting slogans bulatovic supporters monday answered that call to block the official handover of the presidential post due on thursday thousands were reported en route from towns all over the republic
security was tight and the police _ mostly loyal to djukanovic _ checked incoming buses thoroughly for weapons police had earlier warned they would react if threatened by the crowd and told bulatovic and his followers they would be responsible for any violence
bulatovic enjoys the support of yugoslav president slobodan milosevic and has threatened to leave his job to the people not djukanovic hinting at mass unrest
the top us diplomat for the balkans robert gelbard is expected in podgorica on monday to meet with both rivals
the dispute has shaken the rump yugoslav federation which shrank to just serbia and much smaller montenegro after the bloody breakup of the old yugoslavia from 1991
now the serbia-montenegro link could be in jeopardy
djukanovic has won international recognition as elected future president of montenegro but his demands for reform have angered milosevic who as yugoslav president must formally pay equal heed to demands from serbia and from montenegro
milosevic could intervene in montenegro with army or special police
milosevic's state-run media have run a virulent campaign against djukanovic relations between many serbs and montenegrins once considered virtually the same nation have worsened
federal courts based in the serbian and yugoslav capital of belgrade have ruled that djukanovic's victory was invalid this incensed montenegrins who resent domination by milosevic and serbia
this has split montenegro and its 650000 people in two with djukanovic backers increasingly favoring independence and bulatovic supporters still loyal to milosevic and serbia
bulatovic supporters mostly live in northern montenegro next to serbia they have hinted they might eventually split montenegro and join serbia

a syrian who passed information to an israeli spy accused of fabricating some reports has been jailed in his home country an israeli newspaper reported monday
the man was picked up in an arrest sweep the haaretz daily said
the haaretz report based on unidentified foreign sources said the syrian had worked with yehuda gil a mossad agent awaiting trial for fabricating reports that syria was preparing for war with israel
according to the haaretz report gil said the false information came from the source now under arrest in syria
haaretz said the syrian contact was close to the syrian government and met with gil several times in europe over the past 21 years
gil who had served in the mossad for 19 years and retired in 1989 has reportedly said the mole was a high-ranking official in the syrian government who in 1975 provided israel with vital information
at some point gil allegedly began making up information instead and keeping the payments because he felt the need to continue to prove himself after his retirement
gil 63 was arrested two months ago and has been indicted on charges of fraud embezzlement and passing information to the israeli spy agency with intent to damage state security
twice gil's false information reportedly sparked tensions between the two countries once in 1980 and again in 1996 when gil claimed that syrian military maneuvers were preparations for a syrian retaking of the strategic golan heights
israel captured the golan in the 1967 mideast war and syria wants it back in exchange for any peace deal between the two countries
raising a red and white sign that read i love the rupiah indonesia's finance minister swiveled on his feet and grinned monday amid a crush of television cameras

finance minister marie muhammad and prominent business tycoons some in dark suits and others in colorful open-necked batik shirts showed up at the central bank headquarters a number of them pulled sheaves of dlrs 100 bills from their wallets
if each of us doesn't chip in we will be in big trouble said bambang rachmadi head of the mcdonald's restaurant franchises in indonesia who changed dlrs 30000 into rupiah
his eateries are already cutting costs striking french fries from the meal combination offers because the potatoes are imported and must be bought with dollars
a senior official of the international monetary fund met president suharto in jakarta on monday to discuss tough economic reforms linked to an imf-led dlrs 40 billion rescue package
deputy us treasury secretary lawrence summers was also in town to push for reform
the rupiah has been slipping since a southeast asian currency crisis mushroomed last year after thailand floated its currency the baht the indonesian currency sank to a record low of 10550 against the dollar last week setting off panic-buying and rumors of social unrest

it is unclear whether it will take hold in the nation of 202 million people many upscale hotels accept only dollars and most property owners demand that foreigners pay two or even three years of rent in dollars up front
our guess would not be far off the mark if we presumed that even before the floating of the baht last july our moneyed classes had already been buying dollars and on a large scale the indonesian observer said in a recent editorial
many foreign companies are already downsizing taking their dollars with them some executives are even storing their belongings just in case they have to leave indonesia in a hurry
president fidel ramos said monday he has canceled trips to switzerland and the united states to deal with economic hardships at home caused by asia's financial crisis
ramos has come under increasing attack by opposition politicians for making frequent high-profile foreign trips particularly at a time of economic turmoil
delegates at a development conference at the presidential palace applauded loudly when ramos announced the cancellations
he said he was calling off the trips to make sure the guiding hand of the president is present in consultations and decisions made in response to the financial turmoil since july the philippine peso has plunged about 40 percent against the us dollar

wailing and beating their chests over a cluster of enshrouded corpses thousands of shiite muslims said their final prayers monday for the victims of a mass killing
a militant sunni muslim group had claimed responsibility for sunday's massacre of 28 worshipers kneeling in prayer at a lahore cemetery
the dead wrapped in plain white shrouds lay on the dew-wet grass of nasir bagh park in central lahore outside a crowd of shiite muslims battled police attacked government buildings and vowed revenge
mourners burned tires and pelted police with stones shots were fired in the air tear gas billowed through the crowd sending people scurrying for cover
at least 15 people were injured some critically said eyewitnesses
after the final prayer taquir shah a shiite muslim leader mounted a truck and pleaded with his followers to go home
we don't want violence leave the buildings alone he shouted but many of his followers some brandishing automatic weapons ignored him
dozens of young shiite muslims bared their chests and dared police to fire
we're not afraid kill us they screamed at police who had taken up positions outside the building inside government workers cowered from today we will fight we will not spare anyone who kills our brothers
the crowd set fire to the sprawling brick provincial courthouse built before the subcontinent gained its independence from britain in 1947
black smoke billowed skyward as dozens of workers inside fled the burning building firefighters at the site said everyone managed to escape
eyewitnesses said 50 vehicles were smashed or set on fire before police dispersed the crowd the lahore deputy commissioner's office was ransacked and set on fire they said
there was no immediate comment from the government but prime minister nawaz sharif and his cabinet were meeting in the federal capital of islamabad to devise a strategy to curb the rising sectarian violence
warriors of jhangvi a secretive group named for a sunni muslim militant killed years ago claimed responsibility for sunday's massacre and warned of further attacks on pakistan's minority shiite muslim community

cambodian leader hun sen said monday that the country's southeast asian neighbors are in no position to preach democracy or human rights and that he would reject their advice
the association of southeast asian nations indefinitely postponed cambodia's planned entry as a member last july after hun sen deposed his co-prime minister prince norodom ranariddh in a bloody coup
speaking at a seminar on good governance hun sen said monday that representatives of asean's committee on cambodia _ comprising indonesia the philippines and thailand _ were scheduled to visit soon to seek a solution to the country's turmoil
they can come but i don't have anything to discuss with them hun sen said since i am not an asean member i don't need to welcome the asean troika
hun sen said asean's record on human rights was no better than that of cambodia pointing to corruption in thai elections the brutal military regime in burma the former marcos dictatorship in the philippines and the possible threat of a coup in indonesia
hun sen criticized indonesian foreign minister ali alatas _ who was instrumental in bringing a respite to cambodia's civil war that led to elections in 1993 _ as a meddler who talks too much about cambodia and acts sometimes like our foreign minister
none of these countries can be teachers to cambodia hun sen said we don't want them to come and teach us about human rights and democracy they cannot do it but they want to teach it
other asean members include brunei laos malaysia singapore and vietnam
hun sen's takeover shattered the tense dual premiership installed by the un-organized elections in 1993 at least 43 ranariddh supporters were executed by hun sen's followers in the weeks that followed
forces loyal to the prince have since been waging armed resistance in northern cambodia hun sen has scheduled elections for july 26 in a bid to restore international legitimacy and win back foreign aid cut in protest of his takeover
asean has said it will keep watch on cambodia to ensure that elections are free and fair they are considered a litmus test for cambodia's eventual membership in the organization
to comments from asean members that cambodia's troubles have affected regional peace and stability hun sen said asia's economic crisis had been far more harmful _ and that cambodia had only been slightly affected
please take more of your time to solve your own economic crises and not allow your own economic problems to turn political and affect cambodia hun sen said

just two soldiers were killed sunday in a daylong battle that also was fought on the ground near nyambuye village 30 kilometers 20 miles northeast of bujumbura col isaie nibizi told independent studio ijambo

although they make up 14 percent of the population of 6 million tutsis have traditionally dominated the government army and economy hutus make up 85 percent
the latest spacewalk by two russian cosmonauts has failed to fix an air leak from the mir orbiting station's exit hatch space officials said monday
during their trip into open space friday cosmonauts anatoly solovyov and pavel vinogradov discovered that one of the 10 main locks on the hatch door was broken which prevented a tight seal
the hatch on the mir's kvant-2 module had failed to close properly after a spacewalk in november resulting in a partial loss of pressure in the module but that only affected the kvant's docking chamber sealed off from the rest of the station
the cosmonauts attempted to lock the chamber tightly by using the hatch's 10 auxiliary locks only five of which were latched after the spacewalk in november
but pressure in the exit hatch has dropped by 100 millimeters to the level of 560 millimeters since the latest spacewalk according to russia's mission control deputy chief viktor blagov
mission control spokeswoman vera medvedkova said experts have decided that further repair efforts should be postponed for the time being as the mir's russian-american team would face more pressing matters in the near future
these include a spacewalk later this week the planned docking with the us shuttle endeavor on jan 25 and the arrival of a russian-french team on jan 30 she said
during the next spacewalk planned for wednesday night solovyov and nasa astronaut david wolf would collect some us scientific experiments attached to the mir's outer hull it would be the american's first walk in space
mir the world's longest-flying orbiter will mark its 12th anniversary in orbit next month though it only had been expected to last for five years
despite continuing computer breakdowns the latest of which occurred this month the space outpost has been relatively quiet recently after a string of accidents last year
russia will receive its delayed credit of dlrs 670 million from the international monetary fund imf sometime in the next few days a news agency reported monday
interfax quoted a senior finance ministry official as saying the tranche ordered released by the imf last month should be in russian coffers early in the week
the imf held up disbursement of the tranche last autumn because of the government's sagging tax collections but an imf mission recommended in december that the credit be disbursed when authorities detailed their new revenue-collection plans
an imf team is expected in moscow in late january for its regular review of the government's compliance under its dlrs 10 billion loan program that review would focus closely on the government's tax collection efforts said the itar-tass news agency
the russian government undergoes quarterly reviews of performance under the loan agreement and the imf has repeatedly withheld funding because of concerns about low revenue collection
south korean president-elect kim dae-jung said monday he would push through legislation making layoffs easier despite threats of nationwide strikes by militant labor unions
kim made the remarks when he met with michel camdessus head of the international monetary fund layoffs are a key condition of the imf's record dlrs 57 billion bailout of the sinking south korean economy currently saddles with inefficiencies
under current korean laws layoffs are virtually impossible without the consent of labor unions
kim's single five-year term will not begin until feb 25 but under public pressure he has become actively involved in moves to save the economy
what is clear is that the situation we are in makes it inevitable to accept layoffs kim said
parliament is expected to approve the pro-layoff bill in an extraordinary three-day session scheduled to begin thursday
a maverick labor group that forced the government to retract a similar proposal in early 1997 declared in a statement monday that it would organize nationwide strikes to oppose the bill
we demand that punishment of those responsible for the economic crisis and an overhauling of chaebol conglomerates should come first said the group the korean confederation of trade unions
the confederation which claims a membership of 500000 in auto shipbuilding steel and many other key industries is responsible for many violent street protests in the past
the mainstream federation of korean trade unions which claims 15 million members mostly white-collar and small business also opposes layoffs but it has been pro-establishment
with little public support for any radical labor protests in the midst of an economic crisis it is unclear whether the militant unions would be able to organize effective nationwide strikes
during their 80-minute luncheon meeting kim also told camdessus that south korea's family-oriented conglomerates should change bringing their business practices up to international standards
reform promises south korea has given the imf ban cross-funding and cross-repayment guarantees among conglomerates' subsidiaries _ a move experts say would lead to dismantling their closely knit business empire
those inefficient bookkeeping practices have helped conglomerates grow some of those conglomerates have collapsed under huge debts in the past year saddling banks with billions of dollars in bad loans and fueling a financial crisis
camdessus said he plans to meet both business and labor leaders tuesday to persuade them to make concessions to save the korean economy
upon arrival in seoul earlier monday the imf chief said he was satisfied with reforms made so far by south korea as conditions of the imf's bailout
it was his second visit to seoul since early december when the imf agreed to rescue south korea's economy his visit this time is to review south korea's performance
the imf among other things has demanded that south korea cut government spending keep interest rates high and liquidate shaky financial institutions
south korea so far has received dlrs 198 billion of the imf package
meanwhile james harmon president of the us export-import bank said in seoul monday that his bank would expand credit support for south korean importers
i have a lot of confidence like many others in washington that korea will make its way through in time and recover from its current crisis he told a news conference before ending a two-day visit
harmon said the bank's funding to south korea had almost reached the country's limit but he would ask the bank's board to expand credit support to korea
in fiscal year 1997 the us ex-im bank authorized dlrs 7546 million in financing to support us exports to south korea
he said ex-im bank had been taking a relatively smaller role in south korea in the past as us commercial banks had been taking care of most of the business
but now that us commercial banks are reluctant to resume normal business with south korea due to its current instability ex-im bank is prepared to expand its support to the country he said
an armed gang attacked two villages outside the capital slaughtering up to 120 people in a movie theater and in a mosque hospital sources and witnesses reported monday
the two separate attacks sunday evening about 20 kms 12 miles from algiers were the bloodiest in the algiers region since a series of attacks in august and september that left hundreds dead
violence around algeria stepped up with the start of ramadan the muslim holy month on dec 30 at least 600 people were reported killed in two waves of attacks in mountain hamlets in western algeria
according to medical sources at several algiers hospitals 120 people were killed and 100 others injured in the sunday night attacks in a public room used to show movies in the village of sidi ahmed and in a mosque in haouche sahraoui
there was no immediate claim of responsibility for the latest attacks but suspicion fell on islamic insurgents whose battle to topple the military-backed government was moving into its seventh year

public transit employees walked off the job in belgrade on monday leaving buses and street cars idled and commuters stranded
trying to alleviate the effects of the first such strike in the serbian capital in more than 50 years the municipal government went into emergency session and promised to send in buses from other towns a meeting between strike leaders and transport company management also was scheduled
the strike was initiated by the independent union of bus drivers and city carriers demanding half a year's back pay
rajiv gandhi's widow avoided the topic of blame for his death in her first election speech but his congress party said monday that the issue _ which brought down the governement _ remained high on its agenda
a government-commissioned report in november identified the dravida munnetra kazhagam party as a longtime supporter of sri lankan tamil rebels believed responsible for the 1991 assassination of rajiv gandhi
sonia gandhi making her first campaign appearance sunday in the town where her husband was killed avoided the controversy surrounding the regional party governing tamil nadu state
asked to explain mrs gandhi's omission top party leader madhavrao scindia would say only that it was an emotional issue _ but emphasized it remained a priority
culprits who performed this barbarous act should be brought to book he said
following the release of the assassination report congress which supported prime minister inder kumar gujral's united front government from outside pulled it down when gujral refused to dump the party from his 14-party coalition
in tamil nadu local leaders say the report was an affront to the tamil people
sonia gandhi's appearance kicked off congress's campaign for parliamentary elections that will be held on four days between feb 16 and march 7
the congress party has dominated indian politics for most of the country's 50 years of independence but it has been weakened in recent years by corruption scandals and infighting
its main rival the hindu nationalist bharatiya janata party is expected to win the most seats in voting next month for the 545-member parliament
the bjp's parent party accused the congress party of slave mentality to the gandhi family name for asking the italian-born widow to lead campaigning
she is a foreigner and a girl with fair skin who happened to enter into wedlock with an indian the indian express newspaper quoted rajendra singh head of the rashtriya swayamsevak sangh as saying at a public rally near bombay on sunday
mrs gandhi is not running for office

a no-confidence vote against prime minister benjamin netanyahu was to go on as scheduled monday afternoon at the knesset but the prime minister canceled all his morning appointments and was working out of a hotel room in tel aviv
a rare holiday mood prevailed in the streets of jerusalem where bomb scares and frustrations over the stalled mideast peace process often lead to a tense and angry atmosphere people picked their way about on foot cameras in hand
orthodox jewish women in their long skirts cavorted decorously in the snow on the mount of olives palestinian youths in their red-and-white keffiyehs _ so often captured in news photographs hurling rocks at soldiers _ tossed snowballs instead
at an israeli army checkpoint between jerusalem and the west bank town of ramallah two straight-faced israeli soldiers stopped arab motorists as usual _ then broke into grins as they pelted them with snowballs
by midday monday main roads were cleared and public transportation was resuming only a few scattered power outages were reported and ben gurion airport outside tel aviv remained open
the train from lower-lying coastal tel aviv _ which got freezing sleet and hail instead of snow _ was packed with families who brought their children to jerusalem to see the sight

a beneficiary of a huge paternity settlement with the estate of the founder of dhl worldwide express plans to move to the united states and invest in burger shops and other businesses her lawyer said monday
four children from southeast asia have won at least dlrs 90 million each in the settlement with the estate of larry hillblom the american founder of the air courier giant said luz manlapaz a lawyer for one of the children
she's so happy manlapaz said of mercedes feliciano the child's mother this is a classic rag-to-riches story
manlapaz said her clients plan to move to the united states fearing frequent kidnappings in the philippines
feliciano a former dancer in a manila bar plans to send her child mercedita to good us schools so she can become a lawyer she also plans to open branches of a popular philippine drug store chain and hamburger shops there manlapaz said
the eccentric hillblom who died in a 1995 plane crash allegedly fathered the children during a quest for sex with virgin teen-age girls from southeast asian and pacific nations
feliciano is one of two filipino girls who won the settlement they were joined by a vietnamese boy and a palauan teen-ager all children of four young women who claimed that hillblom impregnated them
manlapaz said a settlement of the children's claims on hillblom's estate was reached in september and approved by a probate court on dec 17 in saipan the western pacific island where the tycoon lived at the time of his death in a plane crash
the deal ended a two-year probate battle that had roiled dhl and threatened one of the biggest bequests in the history of the university of california at san francisco one of the beneficiaries named by hillblom in his will
manlapaz said feliciano would get about half of the dlrs 90 million because of tax deductions and other expenses
the estate includes huge blocks of stock in dhl and continental airlines as well as homes condominiums golf courses and land in france california hawaii vietnam and throughout micronesia
a spokesman for dhl has said the settlement would not affect ownership of the closely held firm because the other principals had the right to buy back hillblom's stock from his heirs
hillblom's decade-old will made no bequest for any children but under us law applicable to saipan illegitimate children can share in a parent's estate unless specifically written out of the will
at least eight young women from throughout southeast asia filed claims each contended that as a teen-ager she had met hillblom in a bar had a brief affair with him become pregnant and then been abandoned by him
because hillblom's body was lost at sea there was no ready source of the tycoon's dna for testing to establish paternity so attorneys for the children agreed to do what is known as sibling testing dna tests to determine whether the children had a common parent four of the eight proved to be siblings according to david lujan attorney for larry junior hillblom 13 of palau an island southeast of the philippines

undeterred by a blanket of snow that paralyzed much of jerusalem israeli legislators made their way to parliament monday for a no-confidence vote that was expected to hurt but not topple prime minister benjamin netanyahu
monday's vote was the first since the foreign minister david levy's resignation last week reduced the size of the ruling coalition from 66 to 61 in the 120-member knesset
the whip of netanyahu's likud party zeev baum said the opposition could win the vote by 55-54 but noted that this was not enough to bring down the government still baum said such a victory would be a blow to the coalition's morale
under an electoral law introduced in 1995 an absolute majority of 61 lawmakers is needed to topple the ruling coalition
votes of no confidence are part of israel's parliamentary routine however monday's balloting was the first one since levy's resignation and he and four other legislators belonging to his gesher party were expected to vote against the government
in addition three coalition legislators are abroad and three likud rebels _ former cabinet ministers dan meridor and benny begin as well as legislator david reem _ were expected to abstain to show their displeasure over netanyahu's policies

politicians faced the shadow of violence and a tight deadline as they resumed the search for a northern ireland peace settlement monday
britain ireland and eight local parties gathered monday at stormont the center of british administration in east belfast where negotiations began in june 1996 under the direction of former us senate majority leader george mitchell
when they last met dec 16 politicians remained stuck at the first hurdle despite weeks of talks about talks they couldn't agree even on an agenda outlining what participants should talk about
everyone hoped a new year might bring new attitudes with attention focused on the british and irish governments' may deadline for a settlement to be reached
negotiators realize that the time is now short the clock is ticking said britain's no 2 minister here paul murphy as he arrived
we failed before christmas to come to any sort of reasonable agreement on the topics to be discussed he added noting that realistically we have about 10 or 12 weeks to reach an accord
british prime minister tony blair completing a visit to tokyo phoned several key players in the talks overnight _ including gerry adams leader of the ira-allied sinn fein party and david trimble leader of the main pro-british protestant party the ulster unionists _ to appeal for constructive attitudes
outside stormont sinn fein chairman mitchel mclaughlin said the resumption of talks presented presents both an opportunity and a challenge but he blamed protestant politicians for conspiring to block progress and called on the british and irish governments to push matters along
the negotiating environment has worsened because of rising violence from renegade gangs on both sides and protestant politicians' threats to withdraw from talks
the irish government released nine irish republican army prisoners dec 19 hoping to show sinn fein supporters that the ira's july cease-fire delivers results
the gesture instead upset northern ireland's two main pro-british paramilitary groups they have officially observed a cease-fire since october 1994 and joined the peace talks 15 months ahead of sinn fein but haven't been won similar concessions from the british government
both outlawed groups the ulster defense association and ulster volunteer force warned they might withdraw from talks
analysts paid little attention to that threat until an ira splinter gang killed the leader of the loyalist volunteers a renegade protestant gang opposed to the talks gunmen from that group _ among them disgruntled members of both the uvf and uda _ have since attacked three catholic social venues killing three men and wounding eight
northern ireland secretary mo mowlam temporarily secured that truce by visiting both groups' commanders inside the maze prison friday and promising them that prisoner releases would form part of a peace settlement
if politicians can't strike an accord by may the british and irish governments warn they may present their own peace plan in referendums to voters in northern ireland and the irish republic anyway
the governments' preferred settlement outlined in 1995 would maintain northern ireland's union with britain but eliminate the system of direct rule from london instituted in 1972 instead belfast would have a new regional assembly where protestants and catholics share power
to address catholics' demands for formal political links with the rest of ireland new committees composed of belfast and dublin lawmakers would coordinate policy in areas of agreed interest such as tourism and agriculture
sinn fein opposes creating any northern ireland assembly since it wants the state abolished protestant leaders oppose cross-border committees with even token powers fearing these could lead to irish unity
thousands of supporters of a protege of yugoslavian strongman slobodan milosevic headed into the capital of montenegro on monday and a top us envoy was expected to try and defuse a conflict that could lead to more bloodshed in the balkans
tensions have soared in montenegro since milo djukanovic won presidential elections last october incumbent momir bulatovic has said he doesn't recognize the result and called for mass open-ended protests against it
waving flags and chanting slogans bulatovic supporters monday answered that call to block the official handover of the presidential post due on thursday thousands were reported en route from towns all over the republic
security was tight and the police _ mostly loyal to djukanovic _ checked incoming buses thoroughly for weapons police had earlier warned they would react if threatened by the crowd and told bulatovic and his followers they would be responsible for any violence
bulatovic enjoys the support of milosevic and has threatened to leave his job to the people not djukanovic hinting at mass unrest
the top us diplomat for the balkans robert gelbard is expected in podgorica on monday to meet with both rivals
the dispute has shaken the rump yugoslav federation which shrank to just serbia and much smaller montenegro after the bloody breakup of the old yugoslavia from 1991
djukanovic has international recognition as the president-elect but his demands for reform have angered milosevic who as yugoslav president must formally pay equal heed to demands from serbia and from montenegro
federal courts based in the serbian and yugoslav capital of belgrade have ruled that djukanovic's victory was invalid incensing montenegrins who resent domination by milosevic
milosevic could intervene in montenegro with troops his state-run media have run a virulent campaign against djukanovic relations between many serbs and montenegrins once considered virtually the same nation have worsened
djukanovic backers among the 650000 montenegrins increasingly favorindependence and bulatovic supporters remain loyal to milosevic and serbia
bulatovic supporters mostly live in northern montenegro next to serbia they have hinted they might eventually split montenegro and join serbia

peregrine is heavily exposed in indonesia where it lent a substantial amount of money to a company whose ability to repay it was thrown into doubt following a massive decline last week in the value of the indonesian currency the rupiah
peregrine's efforts to find a buyer failed and that became clear last week when zurich centre investments ltd abandoned plans to take a 24 percent stake in the troubled company
hong kong's chief executive tung chee-hwa on monday called peregrine another victim of asia's financial turmoil
on friday there was a sharp decline on wall street because of growing concern over asia's economic meltdown which began last summer and has since forced the imf to sponsor large bailout loans to thailand indonesia and south korea
new york's dow jones industrial average plummeted 282 percent or 22020 points closing friday at 758042 its fourth-worst single-session point loss in history
such concerns prompted stanley fischer the imf's first deputy managing director to begin talks sunday with officials in indonesia on its dlrs 40 billion imf-led rescue package
last week the bailout came close to stalling when the government unveiled a budget short of reforms the plan required
but fischer emerged from two hours of talks with president suharto on monday hopeful that indonesia would soon announce strong reforms to overcome its economic crisis
i expect that within a few days the government of indonesia will show in a very strong way its commitment to carrying out the program and undertaking a variety of measures that should restore confidence in the economy fischer said
deputy us treasury secretary lawrence summers arrived in jakarta on monday to stress the need for the sweeping reforms summers who also will visit thailand malaysia china south korea and japan began his journey in singapore on sunday

share prices on the korea stock exchange closed higher with the benchmark index at 45620 up 1542 points or 243 percent

final profit figures for the year have not been released earnings in 1996 were 116 billion yuan dlrs 14 billion up from 105 billion yuan dlrs 13 billion the previous year
we have extensive operations overseas an official of the bank told dow jones newswires speaking on condition of anonymity some of these parts haven't fared well

the volume of such transactions was dlrs 1398 billion in 1997 according to the official xinhua news agency it said about 60 percent of bank profits in 1997 were from overseas operations

after five olympic team gold medals jenny thompson of the united states finally cracked the big time on her own at the world swimming championships monday winning the 100-meter freestyle
in other finals monday fred deburghgraeve of belgium the world record holder and atlanta gold medalist who came into the meet low on form won the men's 100-meter breaststroke gold medal in one minute 134 seconds more than a second off his world mark
chen yan of china won the women's 400-meter individual medley and michael klim of australia made amends for not making the atlanta oymmpic 200-meter freestyle final by winning gold over that distance
although klim had hoped to break italian giorgio lamberti's world record of one minute 4669 seconds _ set in 1989 and the longest-standing men's record _ the australian had to settle for 14741 about eight-tenths of a second slower
after 150 meters klim was inside lamberti's time but faded in the stretch
i knew the time but i really didnt care said klim who punched his arm high in the air after his win i just wanted to win
massi rosolino of italy won the silver nearly a second behind klim while pieter van den hoogenband of the netherlands was third
thompson was thrilled with her win
the time wasn't the greatest but i'm really happy with the gold medal for our team thompson said of her 5495-second time well outside le jingyi of china's world record of 5401 it's just one step closer to winning gold in 2000
martina moravcova of slovakia who has trained for three years at southern methodist university in dallas texas was second in 5509 and shan ying of china third in 5510
sandra voelker of germany and amy van dyken of the united states were one-two after 50 meters but the american faded to fourth and voelker to fifth
when asked whether her win over a chinese swimmer was any more noteworthy because of the drug scandal facing the chinese team thompson said let's just say that's one clean win
though an interpreter shan said the local media has been unfair to our swim team it's affected our training and life here as an athlete i say they've gone too far
zeng qiliang of china was second in the men's 100-meter breaststroke and kurt grote of the united states third for the bronze
i trained as hard and as much before atlanta but i wasn't motivated said deburghgraeve after the win on a sultry night at the outdoor challenge stadium my life changed so much after atlanta and it was much harder for me to concentrate on the competition
grote's medal was his first at a world championship
that went exactly how i planned said grote a 24-year-old medical student i just want to go out now and celebrate with my dad if i can find him
earlier china won a gold medal in the men's three-meter synchronized dive and took silver and bronze in the 10-meter platform

turkey's constitutional court on monday froze dlrs 6 million of government funds designated for an islamic party on trial for anti-secularism
the unanimous ruling came only two hours after the chief prosecutor requested the freeze accusing the welfare party of planning to ignore its legal obligation to return the funds to the treasury while the constitutional court considers shutting the party down
each political party gets annual state subsidies determined by the votes they get in most recent elections
the welfare party the top vote-getter in 1995 parliamentary elections is eligible for the largest share in 1998 _ 1236 trillion turkish liras about dlrs 6 million
we have received credible intelligence that welfare is making plans to avoid returning the money to the treasury in case of closure prosecutor vural savas told reporters
the assets and cash reserves of any political party ordered closed by the constitutional court are confiscated by the state
savas asked the court which resumed its deliberations monday to order welfare's funds withheld until it reaches its decision expected within weeks
the court was expected to debate a new brief submitted by party officials friday arguing that the current pro-secular government shares some of welfare's allegedly pro-islamic practices
savas' indictment cites as evidence of anti-secular activity the adjustment of working hours to fasting times during the islamic holy month of ramadan during welfare's term in office last year
welfare says several current government agencies have also recently changed working hours during ramadan
turkey's military which sees itself as the guardian of the country's secular traditions pressured welfare out of power last june
welfare gained 21 percent of the votes in the 1995 elections and currently holds 150 of the 550 seats in parliament
a senior russian legislator said monday that parliament was unlikely to ratify the start ii nuclear arms treaty in the first half of 1998 a development that could complicate plans for a us-russia summit early this year
the state duma parliament's lower house has no plans to discuss the issue during its upcoming spring session deputy duma speaker vladimir ryzhkov was quoted as saying by the itar-tass news agency
us president bill clinton said last month that he would prefer to wait until the duma ratifies the nuclear arms reduction treaty before he makes a visit to russia
officials in both russia and the united states have been pointing toward a spring summit but the timing could be complicated if the treaty remains unratified by russia the treaty has already been ratified by the us senate
clinton said he and russian president boris yeltsin agreed it would be better to meet after the russian ratification so they could use their summit to start work on start iii which would cut nuclear weapons even further
the kremlin has made the same point at the same time voicing hope that the treaty would be ratified soon
the duma which is dominated by communists and other hard-liners has balked at ratifying the 1993 agreement some lawmakers argue that start ii could hurt russia's security and that the nation does not have the money to destroy the long-range nuclear missiles as required under the treaty
the fate of start ii is still unclear ryzhkov said monday adding that there have not been clear answers so far to the numerous questions which parliament members are asking
lazio is mounting pressure on river plate to obtain the transfer of chilean striker marcelo salas to italy
milan's sports daily gazzetta dello sport reported monday that nello governato manager of the italian first-division club flew to argentina to carry on negotiations with river plate officials
gazzetta said governato trip was intended to pave the way to a final effort by lazio's owner industrialist sergio cragnotti
cragnotti was expected to join governato in argentina within a week according to published reports which were not immediately confirmed by the roman club
salas one of the most popular and prolific south american strikers has been long sought by lazio
the roman club which already owns such good strikers as croat international alen boksic and italian stars pierluigi casiraghi and roberto mancini is currently fifth in the italian first division standings with a record of 7-7-4

legislators pressed the hong kong government monday to say whether it plans further steps against an outbreak of bird flu that has killed four people
leung wing-lup the government's deputy health and welfare secretary told legislators that further tests were needed and that the government lacked information to make further plans
we have to consider many factors before we set our next step we are worried that we'd be sending out the wrong message if we make our decision prematurely leung said
the deadly flu which is believed to have spread to humans from chickens has killed four people and sickened 13 others
to contain the virus the government killed all of hong kong's 13 million chickens two weeks ago no new human cases have been reported since the slaughter and officials say they will know wednesday whether the killing succeeded in containing the virus
but legislators have accused the government of reacting too slowly and haphazardly to the outbreak
legislator and doctor leong che-hung said it was ridiculous that the government has no plans at all to take further steps
concerns mounted last week that ducks might also have to be slaughtered after health officials confirmed that some duck excrement samples carried a flu virus tests are under way to determine whether the virus was the same as that in chickens
officials expect results next week
boxing legend sugar ray leonard cast doubt over the continuation of his comeback by pulling out of a promotion scheduled for sydney next month
leonard 41 the first man to win a world title in five divisions was scheduled to fight fellow american and no3-ranked world boxing association junior middleweight contender tony menefee at the sydney entertainment center
on feb 15
a satellite television press conference had been set up for tuesday to announce the bout but leonard's american promoter mike acri on monday informed australian promoter bill mordey his boxer had withdrawn

whatever the reason the three olympic torches slowly making their way across japan to nagano where the winter games are to open feb 7 just can't seem to stay lit
and olympic officials are in the dark over what to do
first we have to figure out what the cause is masato tachibana of the organizing committee's torch relay division said monday we really don't know yet
in just one week since the relay began the flames have gone out seven times including one unexpected fizzle monday and two sunday that did not go unnoticed by japan's major newspapers
it happens yet again said one typical headline monday sacred flame goes out
tachibana said nagano officials are asking the designers of the torches to investigate that company however has already denied the torches themselves are to blame
the fault is not with the torch kenichi akamatsu of katsura co said after sunday's problems but just to be sure katsura sent its experts to kochi 620 kilometers 390 miles southwest of tokyo after a torch went out there saturday
organizers on sunday cited the weather as the main culprit
on the relay's second day runners carrying the flame in northern japan had to stop after it went out in a blizzard and winds were strong during at least one of the extinguishings sunday
tachibana acknowledged that monday's burnout however came in only a light rain
the weather doesn't appear to have been a factor he said
if not the weather organizers say relay officials might not be properly tightening the screws on the propane gas tank that sits inside the torch's handle
organizers stress that back-up flames follow the torches wherever they go and there is thus no danger of any part of the relay not reaching the opening ceremony
without naming names they also say it is not the first time the olympic flame has gone out before making it to the games a popular sports newspaper last week said there were similar problems before the 1964 tokyo summer games and the 1988 olympics in seoul
even so nagano's torch problems are the latest in a seemingly unending series of embarrassments organizers have had to deal with as the feb 7-22 games draw near
after averting a war with skating officials over allegedly sub-standard hotel accommodations in nagano organizers in december put to rest a 5-year-old dispute with the international ski federation over the men's downhill course
but almost as soon as that dispute cooled down international olympic committee officials began wondering aloud whether nagano's venues would get enough snow
then when the snow came last week it came in blizzards
nagano's torch relay got off to a dubious start as well
the flame was kindled last month between temples to the goddess hera and zeus in olympia the ancient greek birthplace of the games in rain and nearly freezing temperatures
still sponsor coca-cola co has gone to great lengths to make the most of the event
the aluminum 15-kilogram 3-pound torches are being carried by 1150 torch-bearers including baseball players movie stars and even a 7-year-old boy who completed his turn sunday
each runner will only carry the torch about a kilometer less than a mile and be accompanied by a gaggle of escorts
all told some 7000 people will be part of the relay and the three routes will bring the olympic flame to all 47 japanese prefectures states and every city town and village in nagano prefecture
nagano city population 360000 is the capital of is nagano prefecture and is in the japan alps about 180 kilometers 115 miles northwest of tokyo et
a german man accused of plotting with islamic militants to carry out a terrorist attack in israel on monday was ordered held until the end of his trial
stephan josef smyrek wearing a red sweatshirt and sweat pants was escorted into court by two armed policemen and did not speak to reporters smyrek 26 from the german town of braunschweig has been detained in israel since nov 28 but his arrest was only made public when he was indicted dec 25
in a closed-door hearing a tel aviv district court judge ruled that monday that smyrek should be held until the end of legal proceedings the defense had asked that he be released on bail
smyrek's lawyer dan assan said the state's case was weak
i don't believe there is enough evidence of an act of conspiracy with hezbollah and no evidence of the planning of a suicide bombing attack in the foreseeable future assan told the associated press after the hearing
smyrek is accused of conspiring to carry out an attack in israel harming state security and membership in a terror organization _ the iranian-backed hezbollah group which is trying to drive israeli troops out of southern lebanon
each charge carries a maximum sentence of life imprisonment
assan said the court made its decision based on a confession smyrek gave to israeli interrogators the lawyer said he believed the confession was extracted by force and that he planned to contest it
no trial date has been set dl/kl
an iranian official signaled on monday that his country is not yet ready to receive a visitor from the us congress
mahmoud mohammadi spokesman for the foreign ministry was quoted by state-run tehran radio as saying that iran has no plans for a visit by us rep tom lantos
mohammadi said lantos had expressed a personal interest in visiting tehran
efforts to determine if mohammadi's statement constituted a formal rejection of lantos' request were unsuccessful
lantos a nine-term california democrat wrote to iranian president mohammad khatami last week saying he was interested in visiting tehran to see whether there was a basis for improving us-iranian relations
lantos sent his request a day after the american cnn aired an interview with khatami in which he called for cultural exchanges with the united states but khatami stopped short of urging an official dialogue
it was the first time an iranian leader had reached out to america since the islamic revolution in 1979
ties between tehran and washington were broken after the revolution and there has been only limited political contact since most government-to-government contacts have occurred through the swiss
lantos who is a member of the house international relations committee last visited iran as a university professor in 1978 fsa-eap
wailing and pounding their chests over a cluster of enshrouded corpses thousands of shiite muslims said their final prayers monday for the victims of a mass killing
a militant sunni muslim group had claimed responsibility for sunday's massacre of 24 worshipers kneeling in prayer at a lahore cemetery
the dead wrapped in plain white shrouds lay on the dew-wet grass of nasir bagh park in central lahore outside a crowd of shiite muslims battled police threatened to storm a government building and vowed revenge
mourners burned tires and pelted police with stones shots were fired in the air tear gas billowed through the crowd sending people scurrying for cover
at least five people were injured some critically said eyewitnesses
after the final prayer taquir shah a shiite muslim leader mounted a truck and pleaded with his followers to go home
we don't want violence leave the buildings alone he shouted but many of his followers some of whom were brandishing automatic weapons ignored him

my party is in a position to seek an equal revenge against the terrorists said mohammed agha ali mausvi a spokesman for ther movement
the shiite community does not want to bury more people he said but added that the government has failed to stop sectarian violence in pakistan
almost 300 people have died in religiously motivated attacks in pakistan during 1997
most of the killings occurred in the punjab province home to 60 percent of pakistan's 140 million people most of whom are sunni muslims who hold no grudge against their shiite brethren
small well-armed militant groups have emerged however and the two sides routinely clash
sunday's attack began as prayer leader allama aktar abbas najvi paused to offer a warning we must be very cautious he said we are not safe here in pakistan
moments later gunmen on a motorcycle roared up to the service and turned their rifles on the mourners killing 24 people and injuring more than 30 in an attack officials believe was religiously motivated
the punjab government called an emergency meeting of law enforcement officials and ordered a judicial inquiry
we will find these terrorists whoever they are chief minister shahbaz sharif said
prime minister nawaz sharif called the attack inhuman
shiite leaders called for sharif's resignation saying he had failed in his duty to protect them

the philippine house of representatives on monday passed an oil industry deregulation bill that will replace a law declared unconstitutional by the supreme court in november
the senate passed its version of the bill saturday a conference committee of the two chambers must now hammer out a compromise version which must be submitted for ratification when the house and senate meet again jan 19
oil companies have suffered major losses since the supreme court imposed a price freeze in early october while it considered the law's constitutionality virtually all of the philippines' petroleum needs are imported and oil companies must pay for those imports with a sharply weaker peso because of the asian currency crisis
the bill will allow oil companies to once again set their own prices it also will compensate them for a portion of their losses since october
the bill passed by the house provides for a transition period of six months before the industry's complete deregulation that could be accelerated or extended for another six months by the president if public interest so requires
during the transition period the government would set retail prices of petroleum products using an automatic pricing mechanism
the previous law which took effect last february was declared unconstitutional because of several provisions that the court judged unfair one set higher tariffs on imported refined oil products than on imported crude oil in an attempt to encourage companies to build refineries in the philippines
a new oil deregulation law is seen as a prerequisite for the philippines' exit from 35 years of economic supervision by the international monetary fund to avoid government deficits while the industry was regulated the government attempted to protect consumers from price fluctuations with a costly oil price stabilization fund
warned by bosnia's top international envoy to act swiftly or face harsh consequences serb lawmakers convened monday in a new attempt to elect new premier and government
the parliament session in the eastern town of bijeljina followed weeks of fruitless negotiations between feuding serb factions over who should be the new premier
hardline deputies loyal to war crimes suspect radovan karadzic have been blocking election of a moderate proposed by president biljana plavsic and supported by the international community
plavsic and karadzic followers are locked in a bitter power struggle that has divided bosnian serbs and blocked functioning of their statelet comprising half of bosnia
the top international official in bosnia carlos westendorp warned of consequences on sunday unless bosnian serbs stop stalling and elect a government that would support the dayton peace accords which ended more than three years of the bosnian war westendorp has the power to appoint a temporary government if the lawmakers fail to agree
but the session was stalled shortly after it began monday with a recess called after aleksa buha the leader of the pro-karadzic faction demanded live broadcast of the proceedings to all parts of the serb substate
many of those in the eastern part loyal to karadzic have not been able to see live broadcasts since transmitters of the television outlet run by karadzic loyalists were yanked off the air last year by the nato-led peacekeeping force for allegedly biased reports
the bosnian serb parliament was elected in elections last november the vote for the first time broke karadzic supporters' grip on power but the hardliners responded by blocking the pro-western forces
the first post-election parliament session ended in disarray last month after the two factions failed to agree on a wide range of issues
karadzic's party and the allied ultranationalist radicals hold 39 seats in the 83-member assembly plavsic's party holds 15 seats but has support from two smaller serb parties and also hopes for backing from 18 deputies representing muslims and croats who fled what is now the bosnian serb substate during the war that would give her 44 seats and enough to have her way on the question of the premiership
but muslim and croat support for plavsic would be exploited by her opponents who already brand her a traitor to the serb cause so she is not keen to enlist their backing on her choice of premier
westendorp on sunday indicated he would make use of his authority to appoint a temporary government if serb lawmakers continue to disagree westendorp supports plavsic's choice for premier 39-year-old economist mladen ivanic
karadzic loyalists reject ivanic's candidacy because he is a moderate who is ready to cooperate with bosnia's muslims and croats and international officials in bosnia
the western countries have promised economic aid for the serbs if they support ivanic and his government westendorp warned the international community would not tolerate more delays
it is necessary that the situation is solved as soon as possible that is to say tomorrow westendorp said after meeting ivanic in banja luka sunday

french foreign minister hubert vedrine braved a snowstorm on monday to travel to jordan for talks with king hussein
his trip to the middle east came as the region was hit by a heavy snowstorm that stopped traffic and cut power in a number of countries including jordan lebanon and syria

germany will introduce a new 50-mark bill next month designed to foil counterfeiters completing a security upgrade for larger denominations the central bank said monday
the new design adds a small silvery emblem to the front of the bill that shows different images when viewed from different angles it is supposed to be difficult to reproduce new versions of the 100- and 200-mark bills were introduced in august
adding the emblems is the second adjustment for germany's paper money this decade in the early 1990s germany entirely redesigned paper money that had been in circulation for 30 years
critics complained that change was unnecessary because of the approaching launch of europe's common currency the euro on jan 1 1999 central bankers argued that the new design with its embedded aluminum stripes was needed to outsmart counterfeiters
but technology helped counterfeiters get smarter they soon began producing decent fakes using the latest color photocopiers so the bundesbank devised new security features for the top three denominations adding the iridescent emblem and a vertical band of small squares
police officials deemed the new design an improvement but cautioned the bills still won't be entirely counterfeit-proof the bundesbank says each one costs about an extra pfennig a little under two-thirds of a cent to print
the new 50-mark bill debuts feb 2 older versions of the 50- 100- and 200-mark bills are still in circulation the bundesbank said

one took gold another umbrage over the chinese drug controversy and a third grabbed a place in the record books
on the opening day of the world swimming championships chinese swimmers were where they were expected to be _ in the spotlight
chen yan the 16-year-old world record holder in the 400-meter individual medley launched what is expected to be a run of chinese gold medals with victory in the event
her time of four minutes 3666 seconds was well outside the world record of 43479 she set at the chinese national titles in shanghai last october
earlier compatriot shan ying was third behind five-time olympic gold medalist jenny thompson 5495 seconds of the united states in the 100-meters freestyle shan's time of 5510 was also well outside her best effort in 1997
both chen and shan said the furore surrounding the discovery of 13 vials of growth hormone in the luggage of a chinese swimmer en route to the championships had a detrimental effect on the team
the incident certainly affected us said shan 19 from zhejiang who
complained about media coverage in particular in australia
speaking through an interpreter she added the local media has been unfair to our swim team
it's affected our training and life here as an athlete i say they have
gone too far

a jubilant thompson was asked within minutes of her race if it was more satisfying to have beaten a chinese swimmer
she responded let's just say that's one clean win

despite protests from the local car industry the government will proceed with plans to raise tariffs on cars assembled in the philippines out of imported parts an official said monday
trade and industry undersecretary melito salazar said the tariffs would be increased from 3 percent to 7 percent this year and then to 10 percent in the year 2000
philippine car assemblers had appealed for a delay in the tariff increase saying it would force additional price increases at a time of declining sales car sales fell 15 percent last year in part because of sharply higher interest rates according to industry figures
in private discussions the car manufacturers have let us know that it is manageable to have a 30 percent tariff differential between locally assembled and imported cars salazar told dow jones newswires
the tariff on completely built imported cars will remain 40 percent much lower that for most other countries in the region that are trying to encourage local car industries
salazar said the increased tariff on imported car assembly kits is an attempt to encourage production of auto parts in the philippines the alternative _ to put individual tariff rates on each auto part to protect those that could be assembled locally _ would be far too cumbersome he said
he added that the government plans to introduce special incentives for production of auto parts as part of its investment priority plan for 1998 but did not specify what the incentives would be

he is still in detention and will be charged sgt vivienne phillips said
as staggie was taken away other gang members fired shots and threw petrol bombs at police but no one was injured
cape town has seen a bloody start to 1998 with a wave of gang violence in the city's black and mixed-race cape flats townships
police say the violence is a mixture of gang warfare and clashes with the anti-crime vigilante group people against gangsterism and drugs pagad
no one from pagad was immediately available for comment but the organization has denied involvement in the recent violence
staggie's twin brother rashaad was murdered by pagad supporters in 1996 when they set him on fire and shot him during an anti-crime protest march
that death triggered off a wave of violence that appeared to be subsiding but in recent weeks shootings and killings have again become an almost daily occurrence raising fears that the city's lucrative tourist industry could suffer
since jan 1 there have been a spate of drive-by shootings on the houses of alleged drug dealers the most recent occurred sunday in cape town's woodstock suburb killing one man
most of the gang violence occurs far away from the beaches and night clubs popular with tourists but the killings last week of american edward keim iii and local businesswoman marilese van der merwe by a gang who abducted them in their car drew worldwide attention
the killings were among 19 murders already this year in the cape town area exact figures for last year were not immediately available but police said they were much lower in 1997
in an indirect challenge to president slobodan milosevic yugoslavia's senior military officer urged closer ties to nato in comments published monday
the chief-of-staff gen momcilo perisic told the vecernje novosti newspaper that yugoslavia should join partnership for peace nato's program for non-member nations likely to join later if it doesn't yugoslavia will be isolated and faces further destabilization he said
his comments represented the bluntest call so far for yugoslavia _ now formed of serbia and montenegro _ to move closer to the western military alliance that is traditionally considered hostile to the serb cause
intense nato air attacks forced bosnian serbs to cave in and agree to peace in 1995 since then hardline bosnian serb leaders who have links to milosevic have vilified the nato-led bosnian peace force as having an anti-serb bias
perisic hedged his support of nato saying moving closer to the alliance would not increase yugoslavia's national security but would certainly prevent some incidents that nato may try to provoke
still his views are unlikely to find favor with milosevic an authoritarian leader with a communist past who fears that closer ties to democratic west-oriented organizations like nato would curb his influence
perisic said that if yugoslavia doesn't join the world trends it may face ethnic clashes in its albanian-populated province of kosovo and further economic decline
wider social upheavals are quite likely if the economic situation is not improved perisic said
four german professors filed a lawsuit monday in the country's highest court in hopes of postponing the introduction of the euro the single european union currency planned to start on jan 1 1999
the academics a lawyer and three economists say the currency union is bound to fail because germany and other prospective members cannot meet strict fiscal requirements such as debt reduction
their 352-page lawsuit asks the karlsruhe-base court to issue an injunction barring the government from going ahead with the project
many germans fear replacing the strong deutsche mark with the euro will water down the value of their money but chancellor helmut kohl's government insists the euro will be as stable as the mark
the main debate has centered on countries' ability to meet the treaty's target limiting budget deficits to 3 percent of gross domestic product _ which the professors say is impossible
a constitutional law expert in the group karl-albrecht schachtschneider wrote in an article for saturday's frankfurter rundschau newspaper that the debt of eu countries hoping to join the euro has risen an average of 20 percent since the euro requirements were finalized in 1992
he also said that germany's debt will continue to be burdened for decades to pay for reunification with eastern germany where the economy lags far behind that of the western states
today we know that the monetary union has no chance schachtschneider said
in 1993 the constitutional court ruled that the euro criteria laid down in the eu's maastricht treaty cannot be softened
most of the would-be participants including germany have struggled to meet the 3-percent target using what has been derisively called creative accounting _ speeded-up privatizations pension fund transfers and other maneuvers _ to raise money
critics say those solutions bring only temporary results
it is clear that there have been one-off efforts or what the english call window-dressing to meet the criteria said one of the plaintiffs university of tuebingen economics professor joachim starbatty
that which the treaty demands _ a sustainable fiscal situation _ hasn't been achieved he said
the court has no deadline for deciding whether to accept the case but it would have to act quickly if it wanted to stop the process
eu governments are to make the final decision on which countries qualify for inaugural membership on may 2 based on 1997 economic data most economists now see a large group of around 11 countries joining the euro from its launch
a national migrants' group on monday blamed turkey's inability and unwillingness to solve its kurdish problem as the main reason for the recent explosion in illegal immigration of kurds to europe
two boatloads of kurds from turkey and iraq caught off italy's shore recently alarmed european capitals which have put pressure on turkey to stop the exodus turkish authorities responded by arresting thousands of foreigners _ including iraqi kurds pakistanis and bangladeshis _ suspected of plotting to sneak into western europe
in the latest operation the police apprehended 73 europe-bound iraqi kurds in istanbul on saturday the anatolia news agency said monday
but many have criticized the turkish government's crackdown as a cosmetic show of force targeting the wrong issues
the problem is directly related to the kurdish problem said mahmut ozgur president of the migrants cooperation association as long as conditions forcing kurds of their homes in the southeast are not solved fleeing west will continue
ozgur's group works with thousands of kurds who migrated to turkey's western cities when their villages were evacuated by security forces since 1991 some 2 million kurds from 2500 villages have been forced to relocate the 13-year-old war between kurdish rebels and turkish forces has claimed over 27000 lives
one kurd who accompanied ozgur during a press conference monday said harsh economic conditions and continuing political repression here were forcing them to look toward western europe
if i can't return to my village i can't survive here any longer _ i'll go to europe zubeyir degirmen said
turkish authorities claiming the war on the rebels has been mostly won say kurds can return home but few have ozgur said the war was going on security was still a problem and pressure on villagers had not been eased
china delivered a sharp protest to the philippine government monday after a surprise visit to manila by taiwan's premier
taiwanese officials said premier vincent siew's trip was part of taiwan's efforts to help neighbors stricken by asia's financial crisis
siew visited the manila headquarters of the asian development bank of which taiwan is a member a leader of a chinese-filipino businessmen's association announced at a dinner for taiwanese businessmen that siew had also met with philippine president fidel ramos but philippine officials denied that any such meeting occurred
there was a request by siew for an audience with the president but we turned it down ramos' appointment secretary apolinario lozada said
in the visa given to siew it was specified there should be no meeting with any philippine government official and no visit to any government agency he said
china's ambassador delivered a sharp protest to the philippine government over siew's visit embassy spokesman hao yinbiao said
we have made a severe representation this is a very unfortunate event hao said we strongly oppose any kind of official contact between countries that have diplomatic relations with the people's republic of china and taiwan
china claims taiwan as a breakaway province with no right to its own foreign relations the philippines like most countries has diplomatic relations with beijing but maintains strong unofficial ties with taipei
taiwan has been relatively unaffected by asia's financial crisis in part because of its large foreign currency reserves
china claims taiwan's offer of aid to its stricken neighbors is simply a pretext to upgrade relations with southeast asia
beijing expressed displeasure in november when siew held brief airport meetings with singapore prime minister goh chok tong and malaysian prime minister mahathir mohamad to discuss the asian financial crisis
in 1994 taiwan president lee teng-hui made an unannounced private visit to the philippines and briefly met ramos at the subic bay industrial complex north of manila said eddie yang information chief of taiwan's de facto embassy
yang said siew also made a private visit to the philippines in 1996 when he was still a member of the taiwan's legislature
taiwan on sunday sent economics czar chiang pin-kung to the philippines at the head of a high-powered business delegation that will also travel to thailand malaysia and indonesia
yang said chiang and the 80-member trade delegation are in the philippines to look for potential investments and demonstrate taiwan's willingness to help southeast asian countries overcome their current financial woes
we are willing to cooperate and to help in whatever way we can he said
siew's spokesman david lee said the premier would return home tuesday morning
taiwan's leaders often must travel abroad in semi-covert fashion to pre-empt protests from china that could force the cancellation of their visits
french president jacques chirac on monday called for an international ban on human cloning hours before 21 european nations were to sign an agreement to prohibit the genetic replication of humans beings
chirac's speech came two days after us president bill clinton blasted a chicago physicist's intention to clone humans as untested and unsafe and morally unacceptable and urged the us congress to outlaw human cloning
chirac told a meeting of members of the european national ethics committee that it is on the international level that one must ban cloning and the genetic manipulation susceptible to altering the character of the human species
the july 1996 presentation of dolly the sheep the world's first cloned mammal set off a storm of international outcry over the implications for human biology
many us and international leaders renewed their condemnation after chicago scientist richard seed said jan 7 that he planned to begin working on human cloning using a newly developed technique
we would resolve nothing in banning certain practices in one country if the doctors and researchers can develop them elsewhere said chirac it is thus how one should stop the worrying trend that some people have publicly foreseen in the united states chirac said
representatives from 21 members of the council of europe later monday planned to sign a protocol that would commit their countries to prohibiting all use of cloning techniques aimed at creating genetically human beings
the 40-member council of europe was founded in 1949 to promote democracy human rights and the rule of law
the cloning protocol agreed to by european heads of state at a summit last october will not include two of europe's biggest countries among others
germany claims the measure is weaker than a current german law that forbids all research on human embryos _ a legacy of the nazis' attempts before and during world war ii to conduct genetic engineering of humans
britain with a strong tradition of defending the freedoms of scientific research also balked at joining the protocol
most british veterans' associations on monday rejected as an insult an apology by japan for brutal treatment of world war ii prisoners and hinted at trouble during a spring visit by japan's emperor
however one association which is not seeking financial compensation the royal british legion welcomed the apology and said its leaders will visit japan
japanese prime minister ryutaro hashimoto expressed deep remorse monday to visiting british prime minister tony blair and offered trips for veterans and scholarships for their descendants reportedly worth 800000 pounds dlrs 13 million
the wording of the apology was the same as a statement issued in august 1995 on the 50th anniversary of the war's end by then-prime minister tomiichi murayama the tokyo government said
to be offered 800000 pounds worth of reconciliation initiatives is an insult to the prisoners of war and internees said martin day lawyer for the japanese prisoners of war and internees association
at a time when germany is still paying billions of deutschemarks in compensation to survivors of the holocaust these offers are not enough added day
the association is suing in tokyo next month for 13000 pounds dlrs 21000 compensation for each of its 12000 members it said a british visit in may by japanese emperor akihito would be uncomfortable
arthur titherington secretary of the japanese labor camp survivors' association said japan was waiting for the veterans mostly in their 80s to die out so it can get away without apologizing or offering compensation
we were starved and beaten and tortured added titherington 76 a prisoner in japanese-occupied taiwan from 1942 to 1945 they were waiting for us to die then and they are waiting for us to die now
the association of british civilian internees far east regions said the emperor can now expect a less than enthusiastic response in may
the royal british legion said monday's apology was official unlike the one given when britain's previous prime minister john major visited tokyo in 1995
while we can understand the feelings of those people who are seeking compensation we welcome the initiatives about reconciliation the legion said we believe in looking forward not back
it has the ingredients for a nasty brawl as flamboyant entrepreneur richard branson and the world's top lottery boss guy snowden head into a libel trial based on sensational bribery charges
branson the briton who runs everything from airlines to music stores says snowden chairman of us lottery operator gtech corp tried to pay him off to stay out of the race to run the british numbers game
snowden denies trying to bribe branson though a spokesman has previously said the lottery chieftain doesn't remember exactly what was said during a lunch at branson's london office on sept 24 1993
the two sides were meeting privately with the judge sir michael morland at london's high court on monday with opening arguments to a jury tentatively scheduled for tuesday
it was unclear whether any type of late settlement could stop the trial both sides were staying mum _ as british law requires when court cases get under way
the dispute began nearly five years ago when branson and snowden were among the numerous business people seeking to run britain's national lottery
the license to run the numbers game was eventually won by a for-profit consortium known as camelot which includes gtech and the lottery began operating in 1994
branson had sought to run the lottery on a non-profit basis and claims snowden tried to bribe him to stay out
according to branson's account of the luncheon the gtech chairman said at one point i don't know how to phrase this richard there is always a bottom line i'll get to the point _ how can we help you
branson says he was so taken aback that he retreated to the men's room and wrote down snowden's words
snowden has labeled branson's charges grossly defamatory and totally untrue
once branson was accused of lying about the encounter he filed the libel suit against snowden gtech and robert rendine a gtech spokesman
snowden countersued branson saying he was seeking to restore my good name the two cases have been combined with both sides seeking unspecified damages
when the lawsuits were filed it emerged that also present at the lunch was john jackson chief executive of the british dry-cleaning and film processing company sketchley plc and a friend of branson's who has backed up branson's story
branson was involved in a similar libel scenario before in his old feud with british airways and its former chairman lord king
when british airways executives questioned branson's charges about a dirty tricks campaign aimed at branson's carrier virgin atlantic ariways branson hit back with a defamation suit
the case never went to trial _ british airways reached a settlement in which king issued a humiliating public apology to his rival branson kept up the pressure and king soon apologized again before long king had to retire early
the current dispute pits branson the best-known tycoon in britain with his virgin logo prominent on airlines trains music stores cinemas colas and financial services against snowden who is less of a well-known personality
snowden's influence is still vast as gtech based in west greenwich rhode island is involved in running 29 state and local lotteries in the united states as well as games in 49 other countries
the two sides have estimated that a trial could run between three and six weeks
thousands of supporters of a protege of yugoslavian strongman slobodan milosevic on monday headed into montenegro's capital city where a top us envoy tried to defuse a conflict that could lead to yet more bloodshed in the balkans
tensions have soared in montenegro since milo djukanovic won presidential elections last october incumbent momir bulatovic has said he doesn't recognize the result and he has called for mass protests against it
waving flags _some with communist red stars _ and chanting slogans bulatovic supporters monday answered that call to block the official handover of the presidential post due on thursday thousands were reported en route from towns all over the republic
serbian orthodox church patriarch pavle issued an appeal monday telling montenegrins to calm their passions lower their voices so words would not turn into armed conflicts
the patriarch also indirectly appealed to bulatovic to step down and hand over power without struggle in order to disprove that all those who hold power for a long time are not unchangeable
security was tight and the police _ mostly loyal to djukanovic _ checked incoming buses thoroughly for weapons police had earlier warned they would react if threatened by the crowd and told bulatovic and his followers they would be responsible for any violence
bulatovic enjoys the support of milosevic and has threatened to leave his job to the people not djukanovic hinting at mass unrest
the top us diplomat for the balkans robert gelbard arrived in podgorica on monday to meet with both rivals he first met bulatovic
the dispute 7th graf pvs
tom dolan suffers from severe asthma while china's shan ying is feeling the heat from the drug controversy surrounding her country at the world swimming championships tuesday both will be chasing gold
american tom dolan the reigning olympic and world champion and world record holder contests the 400-meter individual medley
the lanky dolan 21 enters the pool brimming with confidence
he spent three weeks training in perth this time last year with a university of michigan team and says the weather is a big help with his condition
i loved it here last year that is one of the things that has helped me a lot in training for this meet said dolan
the air was great i trained great i was able to see how the air was and how i dealt with it
dolan's olympic 400m medley gold medal at atlanta in 1996 made him the first american to win the event in 20 years
he is unquestionably the top male individual medley swimmer in the world
but at the us nationals and pan pacific championships in japan last year he suffered asthma attacks
he said the ailment has served only to strengthen his mental toughness
just to deal with the asthma and train at a high level i know in my mind that that gives me an edge over everybody because my body's been going through that much more pain and stress dolan said
his main rivals tuesday should be marcel wouda of the netherlands the top-ranked swimmer in both medleys in 1997 australia's matthew dunn and canadian curtis myden
china's shan ying third in the 100-meters freestyle monday contests the
200-meters freestyle tuesday olympic champion claudia poll of costa rica will also be among the top contenders
shan the fourth fastest in the world in the event behind compatriots chen yan wang luna and poll admitted monday that the furore over the discovery of growth hormones in a teammate's luggage has caused stress
the incident certainly affected us said shan the local media has been unfair to our swim team
wang will also contest the event but chen winner of the 400-meter individual medley monday night has not entered the 200 freestyle
the chinese women won 12 of 16 events at the last world championships in
rome in 1994 but were the centre of suspicion over the use of performance-enhancing drugs
renewed outrage has surfaced following the discovery thursday of growth hormones in the luggage of a chinese swimmer en route to the eighth world titles
australia's samantha riley the reigning world champion is expected to face south africa's penny heyns the olympic champion and world record-holder in the 100-meters breaststroke
hungary's agnes kovacs 16 the surprise 200m backstroke bronze medalist in atlanta will also prove a threat
the gold medals on the first day monday were evenly split with china united states belgium and australia each winning one of the four events staged
indonesia's two top islamic leaders voiced support monday for prominent opposition figure leader megawati sukarnoputri in her bid to run for president and said president suharto should end his 32-year-rule
but neither was optimistic about her chances despite economic turmoil under the 76-year-old leader
on saturday megawati said she was willing to run for president if no one else was nominated to replace suharto
abdurrahman wahid the leader of indonesia's largest islamic group nahdlatul ulama which has about 30 million members and amien rais the head of the 28 million-strong muhammadiyah group said they saw megawati's pronouncement more as a solid symbol for political change than a genuine bid for power
they noted she is without a recognized political party and without support in the nation's parliament and thus blocked constitutionally from becoming president
in our hearts we know suharto has to be replaced wahid more commonly known as gus dur said in a telephone interview
but the problem is there is a difference between our idealism and the realism of the situation
he compared megawati to maverick us presidential candidate ross perot who lost two presidential elections but could not be ignored
amien added that megawati has only a slight chance as she fights for the presidency from outside the system the newspaper jakarta post reported monday
amien recently said he also was willing to be nominated for the presidency
about 90 percent of indonesia's 202 million people are muslim making it the world's most populous islamic nation
wahid estimated that about 30 million voters supported megawati
suharto a retired army general dominates indonesia's tightly controlled political system
he came to power and replaced megawati's father indonesia's founding president sukarno after his troops crushed what was alleged to have been an abortive communist coup in 1965
suharto has been nominated by the ruling golkar party for a seventh consecutive five-year term but has yet to state publicly whether he will stand
presidential elections are not conducted by popular vote but are decided by an assembly made up of 500 suharto government nominees and a 500-member parliament dominated by golkar the parliament also includes 75 representatives of the powerful military
most analysts predict suharto will stand again however there have been growing calls for him to step down because of the effects of a dramatic slump in the rupiah that is expected to fuel unemployment slash economic growth and possibly lead to social unrest
international monetary fund and us officials are visiting indonesia this week to salvage an imf economic rescue program worth about dlrs 40 million the package was put together in october after big falls in the value of the rupiah
however the currency sank to a record low of 10550 rupiahs to the us dollar last week amid fears that the imf package was coming unglued because indonesia had failed to implement sufficient economic reforms
the rupiah closed at 8600 rupiah to the dollar monday down from its friday close of 8075
governments should take urgent action to prevent destruction of the world fish population britain's prince philip warned monday urging cuts in state subsidies to fishermen and the prohibition of fishing in certain international waters
governments are subsidizing the fishing industries to the tune of some dlrs 54 billion annually and of course the irony is the total fish catch is only worth about dlrs 70 billion dollars said the prince husband of queen elizabeth ii making an unusual public appearance to boost a campaign by the world wide fund for nature
among the other steps urged by environmentalists during the globally recognized international year of the ocean are dissuading tuna fishermen from practices that kill dolphins albatrosses and other marine life reducing the use of explosives and poisons near coral reefs in the south pacific and cutting quotas on big fish like tuna and swordfish whose populations are falling
the international year of the oceans presents a wonderful opportunity to initiate a campaign to ensure that there will be a reasonable stock of fish for future fishermen and a reasonable supply of fish for future consumers said the prince i believe that and delay in taking the necessary actions will amount to passing a rapidly devaluing buck to future governments by which time irreparable damage will have be done to one of the world's major renewable sources of food
as part of the worldwide fund's endangered seas campaign environmentalists are teaming up with businessmen to give consumers a green choice when they buy frozen fish by certifying that the products come from waters that are not over-fished
right now it is a free-fall situation where everyone just goes to the sea and takes out what they want said carl-christian schmidt project manager for the marine stewardship council the result is too many fishermen chasing too few fish that leads to depletion of the fishing stock
the council started last year has drawn support from such major companies as unilever british petroleum and the safeway sainsbury's tesco and asda supermarket chains in britain
according to un figures worldwide fish harvests boomed in the middle of this century but have leveled off or fallen in the 1990s because of over-fishing governments have banned fishing from certain areas to allow populations of cod and other popular food fish to recover
four iraqis have been detained in an assassination attempt on an iraqi diplomat in jordan government officials said monday
the four were apprehended thursday in a police raid on an amman apartment the officials said speaking on condition of anonymity they did not say why announcement of the arrests was delayed
on jan 3 a gunman fired at rahim taher _ a commercial adviser with the iraqi embassy _ as he was leaving his amman house for work the bullets hit taher's car missing him
one official said that the four men in custody implicated two other men in the attack including an iraqi diplomat he would not elaborate
another official said the four indicated the motive for the attack was financial and related to a family dispute he added that it was certainly not political
taher said in a recent interview that he did not know who shot at him but believed it was aimed at undermining iraq's ties with jordan
relations between the two countries soured in december when iraq executed four jordanian students convicted of smuggling car parts despite pleas from the jordanian government that they be spared

a cathay pacific 747 jumbo jet with 380 passengers on board was forced to return to hong kong on sunday morning after the pilot discovered an engine failure two and a half hours into its flight to london
flight cx251 took off from kai tak after midnight and the problem was discovered around 3am
immediately after low oil pressure in the plane's fourth engine was noticed the pilot alerted hong kong control tower and the boeing 747-400 flew back landing safely at about 6am
the passengers were transferred to another aircraft a few hours later and took off for london at 930am on sunday
a cathay pacific spokesman said one of the plane's engines had low oil pressure but they had fixed the problem
it was not a major problem _ we have already fixed the engine and it is now in use again we have not had this kind of problem before on this type of plane the spokesman said the engine problem on the 747 jumbo jet 400 series had nothing to do with the safety fears last year after two engines shut down in flight within a week
safety fears prompted cathay pacific to keep some planes within an hour's flying time of airports last may when a cathay airbus a330-300 was forced to make a single-engine landing at bangkok it was the fourth such incident involving a trent 700 engine in use by a hong kong carrier since november 1996

hong kong ducks are likely to escape a mass slaughter even though tests have shown those from the markets appear to have been infected with the killer bird flu virus
the chances of slaughtering the ducks will be very low michael suen ming-yeung acting chief secretary for administration said on sunday
the government has launched an urgent investigation into how ducks in market stalls were infected with the virus
mr suen was speaking after initial tests showed local farm ducks had not caught the disease while those in the markets had tested positive for the virus
in less than 10 days the government will receive a full report on the chicken slaughter and no decision on a duck cull could be made until then he said
a world health organisation official said the results of the tests on ducks should be carefully interpreted before any conclusions could be made
we will evaluate the data after proper examination has been done dr kouichi morita said
dr morita based in manila as regional adviser in communicable diseases at the who regional office for the western pacific also gave his support to the culling of chickens in hong kong to try to control the spread of the virus
hong kong health chiefs said they were confident the bird flu was under control as there have been no new cases for nearly two weeks
a department of health spokesman said last night the last recorded bird flu case among humans was on 29 december _ two days before the chicken slaughter was supposed to have officially finished
health chiefs said if there were no new human cases of bird flu within two weeks of the chicken slaughter it would have been a successful measure as the incubation period for the virus was one to about seven days
a department of health spokesman said the bird flu is still a mystery we must monitor because other factors may be involved he added that a three-year-old boy who was confirmed as having the virus had recovered and been discharged from hospital
from preliminary epidemiological data at the moment the main transmission mode is in the form of bird to human dr morita said it's reasonable to remove the source of infection from the public there are 17 confirmed h5n1 cases four deaths and one suspected case

although vanity is a characteristic found in almost every human a political act of sheer vanity and deceit can often backfire and lead to a further questioning of politicians' ethical standards
the house deliberation on the motion relating to the bomb threat incident against new aspiration party spokesman premsak phiayura was a case in point
premsak caused a stir about public safety last month when six tnt explosive devices were found on the grounds of his khon kaen home the outspoken mp lost no time turning the incident to his political advantage
while positioning himself as a victim of intimidation from the powers-that-be who he claimed were retaliating against his outspokenness premsak pointed an accusing finger at interior minister sanan kachornprasart for failing to maintain law and order
the bomb threat incident followed a number of verbal duals which has lead to increased tension and animosity between premsak and sanan in november for example the khon kaen mp filed a petition with police alleging that he received threatening messages from a person with the initial s
having a medical degree and good oratory skills premsak was not shy about projecting his public image as a responsible politician on a crusade against all political wrongs
he enjoyed playing the part of a crusading politician - until evidence circulated that he might be implicated in a political hoax aimed at boosting his image
judging from the house debate the nap spokesman may have wished that his party did not file the motion as democrat mps took turns to expose the deceit behind the instigation of the bomb threat
for a start the threatening messages premsak claimed to have received turned out to have originated from calls made from his mobile phone to his pager then the investigation of the bomb threat noted several tell-tale signs that the bombs might have been planted by someone close to him not a job allegedly done by his opponents
in a nutshell the incident was a shameful act done to attract attention and possibly to achieve political gains the crusading politician turned out to be no better but maybe worse than his pariah colleagues whom he is so fond of attacking
due to vanity premsak or people like him who used to enjoy the privileges bestowed on politicians might think they can get away with murder but deceit committed by elected officials begs further scrutiny about ethical standards
the memory of a public scam masterminded by taxi driver sompong luedtaharn is still fresh in the public's mind one can draw an analogy between the incident and the hoax associated with premsak
sompong became a national hero overnight in the wake of his prank phone call to a radio programme when he claimed to have returned bt19 million in cash and valuables to a departing foreign visitor
the public showered him with gifts and cash in recognition of his good samaritan act despite subsequent indications of a possible scam premsak insisted on awarding a gold ruler and throwing a lavish party for sompong a fellow hometown boy from khon kaen's ban phai district
confronted with mounting evidence sompong finally confessed to his prank and was later convicted of engaging in a public scam he is now incarcerated for his crime
the recipient of premsak's ruler set a shameful precedent in a bid to attract public attention both sompong and premsak have resorted to a deceitful ploy
the only difference between them is that sompong is an uneducated taxi driver acting on a whim to seek fame while premsak is a sophisticated legislator who made calculated moves to deceive the public
premsak should now be in need of another ruler to gauge his standards of conduct his public scam predecessor has been imprisoned should a similar verdict apply to the politician who committed a political hoax

hong kong's killer bird flu was a nightmare yet to happen when the leaders of 18 pacific rim nations agreed two years ago on an ambitious project to track down emerging infections that threatened the region
little did they know at the time that hong kong would soon fall victim to a disease so unusual it would threaten not only the region but the world as well
with four lives now lost to the killer flu and more victims in hospital hong kong has become the project's focus of attention
we're all watching it very closely there's so much concern said dr ann marie kimball who oversees the project
dr kimball director of community medicine at the university of washington said hong kong's bird flu scare has become a top issue for the project which was first set up to track down drug-resistant tuberculosis in the asia-pacific region
modelled on a similar operation by the european union the pacific rim project was launched by the 18-member asia-pacific economic co-operation forum apec as an information service for health officials from member countries hong kong china and the united states are all members of apec which is committed to free trade
dr kimball said a close network of health officials from apec could help prevent unnecessary quarantines isolation or border closures as a result of threats like the bird flu
she said countries were particularly interested in how emerging infections like the bird flu could spread through trade and travel within apec affecting food products and infecting populations
but dr kimball stressed at this point there was no talk of apec members considering moves to isolate hong kong

only 100 workers who have lost their jobs will benefit from the interior ministry's new life scheme this year in phetchabun's nong pai district deputy interior minister vatana asvahame said sunday
unemployed workers nationwide are eligible to apply for the scheme but those living in phetchabun and provinces nearby would receive top priority vatana's secretary man patthanothai said
the scheme implemented by the national housing authority would provide 688 rai of land in nong pai district for a new life community
of the total 200 rai would be used to develop infrastructure and construct public facilities such as training centres and 488 rai would be allocated to members of the community each family would receive three to four rai on which they could earn a living from farming
the nha would also provide 30-year housing loans with a maximum bt400000 per loan for community members
infrastructure development would consist of roads a drainage system buildings factories and public wells
man said the phetchabun community would also comprise industrial and small-scale family businesses and a general cooperative
private and government agencies such as the livestock and agriculture promotion departments the charoen pokphan group and the sri thai group would help train members of the community provide rice seedlings and livestock and assist them in marketing their produce he said
the second new life community is scheduled to commence in 1999 and would help 120 families
an interior ministry survey revealed that over 172000 workers from the provinces who had been laid off from jobs in bangkok had returned to their homes and there were 730000 unemployed workers in the agriculture sector and 139000 in the industrial sector
deputy permanent education secretary charat nongmak said a survey by the ministry showed that over 3000 laid-off parents were unable to pay tuition fees for their children half of which were secondary school students

the philippine government's over-sensitive screening of passengers from hong kong for symptoms of the bird flu has come under attack from the sar's tourism leaders
they says such screening is bound to create losses for the philippines and will have an indirect impact on hong kong's deteriorating image among international travellers
provisional legislator howard young who represents the tourist industry was disappointed by manila's move to screen all passengers from hong kong beginning last week
they are obviously overreacting as a member of the international community they should take note of the authoritative advice given by the world health organisation that there is no epidemic in hong kong mr young said
he said screening would reduce the number of visitors from hong kong and would slash the amount of foreign currency entering the troubled nation
they stand to lose a lot of money mr young said adding it was unwise for manila to shut its door on travellers at a time when the hong kong currency was in a strong position
he admitted that the screening would be another blow to hong kong's already ailing industry
the second half of last year saw a 20 per cent year-on-year drop in the number of visitors
the industry was also hit by claims that local hotels were overcharging japanese tourists
indirectly we are going to be hit further by this screening thing mr young said

the international monetary fund's imf conditions for its bailout package are flexible and can be adjusted to fit changing circumstances finance minister tarrin nimmanahaeminda said sunday
when the country accepted the assistance of the imf in august last year no one expected the current regional currency turmoil he said since then circumstances have changed we need to review the conditions tarrin said the focus of his visit to the united states from jan 19 to 21 will be to negotiate with imf officials for changes to monetary and fiscal policies
the tough fiscal and monetary austerity remedies agreed to in august include a requirement that the country maintain a budget surplus of one per cent of gross domestic product
the imf's macroeconomic prescription for asia has been under attack by top world economists who argue that the fund is prescribing too much austerity and will end up pushing recipient countries into severe recession
critics argue that higher interest rates less government spending and increased taxes will only make the patients even sicker
tarrin said he will discuss the matter with imf official lawrence summers who will arrive in thailand tomorrow
speaking on his return from singapore tarrin said he had urged the singaporean private sector to roll over loans to the thai finance and banking sector to help revive the economy
he told them the problems facing thailand differ from those of other regional countries such as indonesia the baht had not tumbled as deeply as the rupiah did last week
many agreed with me that we need to look at each country's problems not in terms of the whole region he said
tarrin also explained to foreign bankers the main principles of the establishment of good and bad banks which will be forwarded for cabinet approval this week
bank of thailand governor chaiyawat wibulswasdi said singaporean banks had expressed an interest in taking up equity in thai banks following the decision by the development bank of singapore to invest in thai danu bank
he told foreign bankers that thai banks would be strengthened as the central bank was restructuring the banking sector requiring banks to boost reserves and improve the quality of loansand by separating good banks from bad
in a meeting with british prime minister tony blair on monday japan's prime minister issued an official apology for his country's actions in world war ii
prime minister ryutaro hashimoto expressed the japanese government's deep remorse and heartfelt apology for the tremendous damage and suffering in world war ii said a spokesman for japan's foreign ministry
the wording of the apology was the same as a statement issued in august 1995 on the 50th anniversary of the war's end by then-prime minister tomiichi murayama said the official who spoke on condition of anonymity
a spokesman for blair however said the apology was different because hashimoto made it clear that it was an official statement backed by the japanese government
in britain most veterans' associations rejected the apology as an insult
hashimoto also announced three programs intended to help erase resentment in britain about japan's role in the war blair's spokesman said
japan will contribute funds for joint visits by japanese and british war veterans to world war ii battlefields and cemeteries in asia it also will help pay for scholarships for the grandchildren of british prisoners of war for study in japan and will expand a program that brings former prisoners of war and their grandchildren on tours to japan
it was not immediately clear whether the two leaders discussed the unresolved issue of direct compensation from japan for british former prisoners of war the japanese government has repeatedly refused to compensate individual war victims
blair also had an audience with emperor akihito and empress michiko at the imperial palace
the royal couple are expected to visit britain in may foreign minister keizo obuchi said monday
i hope the warm feelings and kinship which people in this country have and have expressed toward the people of the united kingdom will transcend and travel across the ocean to the united kingdom to herald the visit by their imperial majesties obuchi said
in london martin day lawyer for the japanese prisoners of war and internees association said to be offered 800000 pounds worth of reconciliation initiatives is an insult to the prisoners of war and internees
the association is suing in tokyo next month for 13000 pounds dlrs 21000 compensation for each of its 12000 members it said a british visit in may by emperor akihito would be uncomfortable
arthur titherington secretary of the japanese labor camp survivors' association said japan was waiting for the veterans mostly in their 80s to die out so it can get away without apologizing or offering compensation
blair arrived in japan friday for a five-day visit that also was to include discussions with japanese government and business leaders on trade and asia's financial turmoil
blair also met monday with international trade and industry minister mitsuo horiuchi and finance minister hiroshi mitsuzuka
blair and mitsuzuka talked about their worries about the indonesian economy and agreed to cooperate where possible to stabilize it a japanese finance ministry official said
blair told mitsuzuka that he welcomes the measures advanced recently by japan to reform its financial sector
in an interview on japanese television blair said japan could help lead asia in recovering from its economic woes
japan by setting an example with changes in its regulatory system and in its financial system can show the asian economies the right way to do it and the right way to gain credibility in the long run he said
the british prime minister also was scheduled to join talks with hashimoto and european commission president jacques santer on japan's future relations with the eu britain currently holds the rotating presidency of the eu
blair's trip to japan is the first by a british prime minister since john major visited four years ago blair last visited japan in january 1996 as leader of the then-opposition labor party tz
the united nations wants an rise of at least 100% in the value of partial iraqi oil sales during the current third phase which went into effect on january 8 a senior un official said monday
denis halliday un relief coordinator in iraq told dow jones that un and iraqi experts were reviewing the current oil-for-food programme which allows sales worth dlrs 2 billion in six months to enable the government purchase food medicine and other humanitarian supplies for its 22 million people
halliday said the discussions were to end this week and among the recommendations there will be a proposal to the un security council to take a decision which will increase iraqi revenues by 100% or even more
halliday said the boost was needed to rehabilitate iraq's drinking water facilities and upgrade the power grid
he said he would be forwarding the recommendations to un secretary-general kofi annan who is expected to put them before the security coucnil at the end of january for approval
halliday has said the current program has done very little to alleviate the suffering of the iraqis under the un trade sanctions imposed for iraq's 1990 invasion of kuwait
haliday said he was optimistic the security council would approve the recommendation
if approved iraq will pump about 16 million barrels per day bpd into an an already glutted oil market by february under the current program iraq plans to pump 800000 bpd
the exact volume of iraqi exports will eventually be determined by prices prevalent on the international markets but lower prices will mean a further increase in iraqi exports
meantime an iraqi oil official said monday they signed their first contracts under the third phase of partial oil exports the official requesting anonymity said french oil giants elf aquitaine and total will be the first to lift kirkuk's sour grade from the turkish terminal of ceyhan in a couple of days lb

results of environmental and economic impact studies on the controversial yadana gas pipeline will be released today and will end the controversy surrounding the matter industry minister somak thepsutin said sunday
the government suspended construction of the pipeline last week and ordered the studies because of intensified opposition by activists and villagers
somsak said the studies will be presented to prime minister chuan leekpai who will have a final say on whether construction of the pipeline will be allowed to resume
the studies were conducted by representatives of the project operator the petroleum authority of thailand ptt groups of environmentalists who oppose the project and non-partisan lawyers
the studies are expected to be complete on monday i believe the conclusion will be that there will be only a small impact on the environment and that it will please both supporters and opponents of the pipeline somsak said
several groups of environmentalists have claimed that a six-kilometre portion of the pipeline in kanchanaburi province which also is routed through burma's territory would destroy dense reserve forests and would be located too close to rural communities
the environmentalists repeatedly demonstrated against the pipeline while the ptt which is responsible for construction denied their charges
those conducting the studies also examined the contracts the ptt has with the subcontractors which are expected to be completed as soon as possible this is because if the suspension is prolonged the ptt will have to paycompensation somsak said
a reporter who was murdered last week once turned down a bribe of 150000 baht _ then worth dlrs 6000 _ to stop working on a corruption story one of his editors said monday

sayomchai was found shot to death in his car saturday in phichit town the provincial capital his wife reported she last saw him when he left their house friday night to meet a mystery caller
suwapong described sayomchai as a good and active journalist who loved to do in-depth stories and won the newspaper's award for outstanding local journalist in 1996
after sayomchai rejected the bribe to stop a story about corruption in the bidding for a construction project his car had been run off the road and his life threatened suwapong said
the newspaper issued a statement saying it believed that the cause of sayomchai's killing was his straightforward reporting
in a statement the newspaper called on the government to take responsibility for arresting the murderer as well as the person who ordered the killing
it also asked for measures to better ensure the security of journalists

with parents placing a high value on their children's education the demand for tutoring services remains strong despite the poor economy students queue up for hours to secure applications at the most popular centres which expect no slowdown in business reports kiattisak vorathaweethamrong
buoyed by parents' strong belief that education should be the top priority for their children several popular tutoring centres continue to see cash flowing in despite the prevailing economic turmoil
as competition to win a seat in prestigious universities remains as fierce as ever hundreds of students scramble to enroll in well-known tutoring centres
extra tutoring took root 17 years ago when students set up their own groups to study subjects in which they were weak but the growing competition for a place in prestigious universities has gradually made tutoring lucrative
at first most centres were located around rajdamnoen however over the past 10 years hundreds of centres have sprung up in more accessible areas such as siam square and victory monument
in fact only a few subjects attract a large number of students physics chemistry mathematics and english several centres have become renowned institutions because their students can successfully pass their entrance examinations
prakitpao thommachit a doctor and a general manger of applied physics a highly-popular tutoring school said that about 30000 students take special courses in his centre each year most students study in the science programme in bangkok's prestigious schools such as triam udomsuksa bodin decha suan kularb and thepsirin
there are also 500 to 600 upcountry students who normally enroll during summer vacation every year
even students at university level join us too he said
the centre has fared well since prakitpao's father established it in 1980 in the beginning the centre had only 50 to 60 students per year however applied physics gained popularity quickly and the centre has three branches siam square bang kapi and wisuthkasat
we have increased the number of classes too from one to two on weekdays and one to four on weekends said prakitpao who noted that march is the busiest month of the year as students have only a few weeks before they sit for their entrance examinations
many students try hard to study with us they camp outside through the night to get a place here he said
he added that his centre is popular because it gives students a thorough understanding of the subject instead of having them memorise texts and formulas
many children said that we make physics easy for them to understand for those who used to hate physics the subject has become their favourite some also said that they successfully passed the entrance exam he said
another tutoring company pure chem centre has four branches
the branches may all be crowded but safety considerations are paramount according to owner uraiwan siwakul
the places look so small that many think they are not safe but we do not overlook safety concerns she stressed
another popular tutoring centre owned by samai laovanich specialises in mathematics unlike other centres receiving thousands of children each year however samai who is also a university lecturer and a member of the mathematics association of thailand's committee is less commercial he has only 600 students per year and doesn't aggressively recruit business
i have been in this business for 28 years and i have never sought any form of advertising children who come here usually learn about us from others some are the children of my former students he said
samai declined to promote his centre by telling parents of students how many of his students had passed the entrance exams however he is almost certain that most of his students find what they learn from his class useful in their studies
itthiporn chuetraisorn a grade 12 student from satree witthaya who has been studying in various tutoring centres over the past six years said that these extra courses helped her improve her academic record
the centres are very useful for me they help me tackle difficult quizzes she said
as a student who will sit for the entrance exam this year itthiporn said she has been able to answer many difficult questions in the exams of previous years
currently itthiporn goes to only one centre which she declined to name she said it is so popular that many students queued up the night before the centre opened for applications
i went at 2 am in the morning when i arrived i saw students who had already been there since 10 pm the day before she said
itthiporn admitted that she has spent a lot on the extra courses but she thinks it is worthwhile
it's better than using the money for bad things i think i'm on the right track she said
narumol supawatthakul itthiporn's aunt agrees with her niece
i'm always ready to support her as far as education is concerned even though it takes more money i will do it to make sure that my children receive the best education she said

pattani - muslim community leaders in the south have called on the democrat-led government to work with local politicians many of whom are opposition members to put an end to the recent spate of violence
the majority of the leaders and academics interviewed by the nation said that since the democrat party does not have a strong hold in the southernmost provinces or the overall support of the local community it should work with muslim politicians such as the wadah group of the opposition new aspiration party to solve the problem
dr isma-ae alee director of prince of songkhla university's college of islamic studies in pattani said that the cooperation between democrat and new aspiration politicians though difficult will help solve the factionalism among all the state agencies operating in the area
many muslim leaders in pattani said that politics has divided local bureaucrats into factions that often attempt to undermine each other's power some times through violence
they however said that the problem has been blown out of proportion by the media and politicians and stated that such bickering does nothing to address it
local leaders said every time a violent incident occurs in the region leaders in bangkok tend to blame islam and believe that any muslim figure such as foreign minister surin pitsuwan and chularatchamontri the country's muslim spiritual leader sawasdi sumalyasak can solve the problem which is not religious in nature
the chularatchamontri is not a southern resident and does not enjoy the kind of popular support people in bangkok think he does also politicians should be aware that the muslim spiritual leader should not be drawn into political conflict since his job is of a religious nature
interior minister sanan kachornprasart last week said that he had invited sawasdi to accompany him on a trip to the deep south to create a better understanding with local leaders but sawasdi declined the invitation saying he plans to go there after ramadan the fasting month ends
local residents said politicians should not point their finger at malaysia for what they consider domestic problems plagued by political infighting mainly in bangkok
the interior minister obviously doesn't know what to do about the situation here so he threw this hot potato to foreign minister surin one academic said
in spite of his islamic faith few leaders here believe surin has the ability to relate to the muslim south they see him as a politician from the democrat party not a muslim leader elected by the people here to represent them
one leader pointed to the recent blunder sanan made when he gave the responsibility to surin by saying that the foreign minister will go to themalaysian border state of kalantan to talk to the governor about the alleged terrorist training ground there
earlier sanan had said that surin would visit malaysia to seek the cooperation of the kelantan governor to end the terrorism in southernmost thailand but surin later changed his mind
besides pointing the finger at malaysia for allowing itself to be a base for the southern muslim separatists will only worsen the two countries' relations malaysia in the past has cooperated with thailand the muslim leader said
prominent members of the wadah group are parliament president wan muhamad noor matha former deputy interior minister den tohmeena former deputy education minister areepen utarasin muk sulaiman and paisan yingsaman
another pattani scholar argued against blaming the failure on the intelligence work of the southern border provinces administration centre sbpac
sbpac's main job is psychological work and it has been successful in building trust with the people here in the past the agency settled disputes between local people and authorities but some of its officials were transferred out of the area it's possible that those troubled by the sbpac tried to create a situation that led to its closure the academic who sought anonymity said
soon after the latest wave of violence in the south the army altered sbpac's role on security and intelligence
the same source also warned against the plan to deploy military forces in the area as it would increase the tension between local communities and authorities pointing to the long and troubled history between the central government in bangkok and the muslim-dominated region
the military are outsiders and don't understand the people here and since the media as well as the bureaucrats often portray the region as a war zone trouble could easily rise and things could get out of hand the academic said
meanwhile interior minister sanan kachornprasert sunday expressed confidence that the situation in southern thailand would return to normal soon
the problem was created by a very small group of people who have never had the support of the majority in the region he said

more than 5000 people marched through the heart of bangkok sunday to encourage thais to fight the economic crisis by selling their us dollars and depositing baht in a display of national unity
the campaign organised by the army and the government's thais help thais committee saw dollars and small amounts of other currencies being traded to commercial banks sunday to the combined value of bt248 million
the rally with people from all walks of life started from lumpini park at 7 am and included government officials senators mps businessmen bank employees and state enterprise employees
heading the march was army commander in chief gen chettha thanajaro and pm's office minister supatra masdit who chairs the thais help thais committee
now is the time for all sections of the nation to unite and face the crisis together chetta told the rally
the demonstrators headed to the world trade centre via wireless road and ploenchit road
fourteen banks set up mobile exchange booths at the world trade centre to enable rally participants in selling their dollars
during the march participants sang the patriotic song rak muang thai loving thailand while waving national flags some carried placards depicting us$100 bills to urge other thais to support the baht by selling dollars some private firms' employees even wore colourful fancy suits
the baht last week hit a series of historic lows against the greenback sinking below bt50 to the dollar for the first time to close at bt5410 on friday
in the biggest show of public unity so far marchers stretched for hundreds of metres to draw the attention of both passers-by and motorists
supatra said the actual amount of dollars being exchanged sunday was not that important
what mattered was that thais were able to show their unity during this time of crisis supatra told reporters at the end of the march
the picture i have seen today has proved the thai people are united and have the cooperative spirit required to solve the country's difficulties we are not separated by our difficulties i am confident the thais-help-thais sell-dollar/buy-baht campaign will help salvage the situation supatra said each person who changed at least us$50 was awarded a thais help thais medal
asked why politicians had not contributed their money to the thais help thais fund supatra argued that the mps had already had their monthly allowances reduced by 20 per cent malee aviruth the corporate finance and accounting manager with international duty free chain king power won applause when she exchanged us$140000 us dollars and 1 million yen for about bt78 million

a group of soccer fans suspected of organizing violent clashes with rival hooligans will be charged with belonging to an organized crime gang authorities said monday
the 14 ajax amsterdam fans will appear in court in early march said stijna den haan of the amsterdam public prosecutor's office
as well as organizing fights by using mobile telephones and the internet the fans are suspected of dealing in drugs and illegally possessing weapons they face maximum five-year sentences if convicted
prosecutors believe the ajax fans arrested in police swoops last september and november are part of the amsterdam club's so-called hard core of supporters notorious for their violent behavior
an ajax fan was beaten and stabbed to death in a battle with fans of archrival feyenoord rotterdam last march the brawlers arranged the fight in advance so they could avoid police sent to soccer fields to control crowds
following the fight dutch interior minister hans dijkstal condemned the violence and said the participants should be punished to the full extent of the law
two feyenoord fans were convicted last september of homicide in the ajax fan's fatal beating and were jailed for four years

the newly-formed palang thai group of renegade palang dharma party mp sudarat keyuraphan emerged the biggest winner in sunday's city council elections for 14 bangkok districts winning 36 seats and beating the pdp democrat and prachakorn thai parties
the once invincible pdp suffered a humiliating loss having failed to win even a single seat pdp leader chaiwat sinsuwong blamed the defeat on sudarat and threatened to expel her as a party mp
about 2380 per cent or 262656 eligible voters came out to vote the bangkok metropolitan administration announced
the democrat party which was the champion in the last national election in bangkok winning 29 of 37 bangkok house seats came in second in sunday's election it won 28 seats while its arch rival prachakorn thai won 20 seats
a total of 100 seats in 14 councils in 14 districts were up for grabs sunday
the 14 districts are bang khen don muang chatuchak bang kapi lardprao bueng koom lat krabang min buri sai mai lak si wang thonglang saphan soong khan na yao and klong samwa
the mittraparp group of new aspiration party deputy leader sukhavich rangsitphol won 12 seats including all seven seats in klong samwa
a local group in min buri district called the min buri pattana won three seats in the district and chat pattana won a seat in sai mai district
following a long conflict with the pdp leader and the party's board sudarat formed the palang thai group which contested an election for the first time sunday sudarat has said the group would become a political party in the future
palang thai swept all seats in bueng koom bang kapi wang thonglang saphan soong and khanayao each of which has seven councillors the group won another seat in lardprao district the palang thai ran candidates in 10 of the 14 districts
sudarat said she considered the group has become successful enough to receive support from bangkokians she said the group would prepare for the next election of councillors in 30 bangkok districts in may
sudarat said she had numerous achievements while serving as a pdp mp but had been persecuted by her own party during the past year
i had no choice but to form this group as an alternative for the people i believe the people want to see a new group of politicians sudarat said
the democrat and prachakorn thai parties fielded candidates in all 14 districts while the chat pattana party which won a bangkok house seat for the first time in the last poll competed in four districts
the democrats swept all seats in chatuchak 8 and lak si 7 it won seven out of eight seats in bang khen two of seven seats in min buri and four of seven seats in lat krabang
after being officially launched in 1985 the pdp had nearly monopolised bangkok politics in both district councils and the bangkok assembly but its gripped started to weaken in the past few years due to the prachakorn thai and democrat parties
initially chaiwat said he would accept the decision of bangkok voters but later sunday he attacked sudarat
chaiwat said voters were confused between palang dharma and palang thai candidates he said he would discuss sudarat's action during a meeting of the pdp board on tuesday
i will definitely bring up this case concerning sudarat to be discussed by the board chaiwat said
however chaiwat said it would be difficult to take action against the party's sole mp because she was protected by the political parties act
by action she is no longer a pdp member but legally she is still a member chaiwat said
commenting on the low voter turnout city clerk prasert samalapa said the bangkok metropolitan authority bma could not be blamed for the low-level public relations campaigns
since the elections took place in only 14 districts we thought it would be a waste of money to launch pr campaigns on the tv and radio or throughout the city prasert said
legal experts said although the new constitution made voting mandatory among eligible voters there would be no legal action taken against those who did not vote sunday
the experts explained that the constitution left it to the election law to prescribe penalties but the law has yet to be enacted

eleven vessels were stopped and checked and 67 people on board were questioned in a massive nine-hour operation in hong kong waters over the weekend
police immigration customs and marine officers joined forces in mounting the operation against the illegal ferrying of people between hong kong and islands off the mainland
the drive against pleasure boats and other motorised vessels got under way at 5 pm on saturday and ended at 2 am on sundayday
among the suspected smuggled goods seized were eggs vegetables and rice
two of the 67 people questioned were handed over to the immigration department and three others to the customs and excise department for further investigation
a government spokesman said about 200 people took these boats daily to go to small islands off the south china coast
most of them go to buy cheap fishing tools and visit brothels he said
he said it was illegal to ride on these boats as their passengers left hong kong without going through proper immigration and customs procedures
operators and passengers of illicit ferries face a maximum fine of $120000 about 80 people have been charged in the past two years
the spokesman warned it was very dangerous to travel on these boats as they were not designed as passenger ferries
they lacked proper life-saving equipment and passengers were not covered by insurance
these boats tended to travel at very high speeds to avoid police detection
last year marine police stopped 549 vessels plying between outlying islands outside hong kong

of the many factors which have rekindled talk about a national government the biggest is a resurgence of reality - the knowledge that a politically fragile government must handle a national crisis of unprecedented magnitude
coalition manager sanan kachornprasert triggered a new round of speculation with his new year meetings with key opposition figures including former prime minister chavalit yongchaiyudh but the reaction only underlined a pervading pessimism which had been suppressed for two months by chuan leekpai fever
with the parliamentary weakness of the 207-mp chuan coalition having been frequently exposed and the controversy over the 12 cobra prachakorn thai mps nearing a potentially devastating climax the pro-democrat euphoria has given way to the inevitable uncertainties of thai politics
chuan heads a six-party coalition which includes the cobra faction withthe opposition chat pattana party waiting on the sidelines to be invited to join the government observers believe this is a good composition because fear that chat pattana could replace them keeps the small parties in line
but even the staunchest democrat supporters have started to question the small-but-strong merit of a government that has a thin 20-mp majority
as the economic crisis continues to deepen and with crucial bills are in the parliamentary pipeline the conventional school of thought that the bigger the better is creeping back to the centre stage
now the political circles are buzzing with the latest national government formula known as 1-2-3-4 it calls for an unthinkable alliance of the four biggest parties - new aspiration democrat chat pattana and chat thai - which between them have 338 mps
surprisingly support for the new formula has come from chat pattana which stands the best chance of being invited to join the government in the near future''true political stability cannot be achieved by bringing in chat pattana because the coalition would comprise too many parties said a chat pattana member
chat pattana sources have suggestions to resolve the looming question of the proposed national government's image chuan still enjoys much public support and should exercise this advantage by making tough demands regarding appointment of cabinet members they said
the whole idea is to have an overwhelming number of hands to support the government in parliament this is not about bringing back controversial people to the cabinet said one source
what we need to do urgently is to pass new effective laws and get rid of outdated ones the 1-2-3-4 formula however is far-fetched to say the least
the new aspiration party for example after all it has been through is most unlikely to support the democrats without some reward
chuan meanwhile prefers his small yet relatively more faithful allies over smiling rivals who may still be hiding knives behind their backs even if chuan wanted the 1-2-3-4 solution he would be in a dilemma because the mere suggestion of a reshuffle could alienate his present allies
and their revolt could trigger unwanted consequences he could lose control and then his rivals could gain the upper hand and double-cross him
chuan does not have to think too hard about the pros and cons of embracing the 1-2-3-4 formula all he has to do is look back a couple of months and review events that propelled him to the premiership that dramatic race gave all politicians the same lesson trust no-one

will the country make the turn soon which will reveal light at the end of the tunnel of financial gloom it has entered pana janviroj examines the immediate prospects
hope and anxiety have been moving in tandem during the first two months of the widely-supported and less-politicised chuan government
the government is on the threshold of major decisions which will greatly affect troubled banks that fail to raise their capitalisation action is expected by the end of this month
political will and public support are essential there is no alternative this final stretch of the reform process will not only make or break this government but also this country the dramatic fall of the baht is a stern warning that there is no time to waste
what is the government doing they should act now because it is already too late said one frustrated us broker after a series of meetings with thai authorities
his concern about the government's lack of focus despite its good intentions was real meanwhile the baht continues to slide
in fairness the frustration is widespread the conventional medicine dispensed by the international monetary fund - halting capital outflow high interest rates and a better trade balance as well as fiscal austerity - has not produced results
foreign creditors are still recalling loans made to thai banks and companies their confidence compromised by the deteriorating corporate situation resulting from the baht's tumble
as the vicious cycle worsens the non-performing loans of banks the general economic recession and the baht's plummet continue to bite the economy
in short it is the mathematics of excess outflow over inflow of foreign capital which is hitting the baht and killing thai companies
if this imbalance is not resolved then nothing else matters according to banthoon lamsam president of thai farmers bank
is there a way out how quickly can the chuan economic team achieve a turnaround what is at stake what is delaying concrete results
the solutions or sparks that everyone is waiting for are nothing other than balancing thailand's foreign capital outflow and inflow
this could come about through massive international borrowings matching the outflow by attracting long-term foreign capital through equities and through the sale of property and other assets to foreigners
the first option is virtually ruled out as neither the united states nor japan have shown any sign of coming up with a marshall plan for thailand
the second option is locked into a concern about nationalism or selling out thai assets to foreigners another obstacle is the slow process of passing essential laws in parliament to facilitate asset sales to foreigners who have the cash to invest
the debate on nationalism has been more subdued than vocal phatra thankit co a local investment bank warned several months ago that as a first step towards resolution the country must acknowledge that the problem is enormous and the following principles need to be accepted to resolve the financial crisis
failing businesses banks and finance companies must be allowed to go underthe government must sponsor the restructuring packageforeign ownership must be allowed to increasenew agencies and a legal framework need to be set up
to be fair this government and the last have put in place policies to tackle the financial crisis given these criteria
the chuan government has added precision and commitment without any confusion to the final steps to be played out in the next couple of weeks
it has set a timetable for banks to raise capital it has sponsored arestructuring package for good and bad banks it has endorsed increased foreign ownership of financial institutions it has appointed suitable people to run organisations set up to tackle the financial restructuring
what the country needs now is the execution of these policies only a few bank deals have gone through and they concern only smaller banks
the big deals still hang in the air as the fear of fire sales spreads
will citibank buy shares in first bangkok city bank at bt1 apiece at what price will thai farmers bank siam commercial bank or bangkok bank sell their new shares and what management control will they losewhy has the government been slow to boost the capital of state-owned krung thai bank
banthoon felt that any further delay would simply force thai financial institutions and corporations into a fire-sale situation but he played down this fear
if it is able to attract long-term funds from overseas that would be better it should not be seen as an end in itself but rather than a means he said
what the sale of assets would do is change the perception of foreign creditors toward renewing loans to the country he added
other fire sale supporters pointed to the experience of the united states where the economic and financial problems of the 1980s resulted in many takeovers of american corporations and assets by japanese
the subsequent resurgence of the us economy in the 1990s allowed americans to buy back the assets
capitalism without bankruptcy is like christianity without hell there is no systemic means of controlling sinful excesses david roche chief strategist for independent strategy wrote in hong kong's south china morning post last week in a commentary on the financial crisis in south korea and other asian countries
but critics of the fire sale situation say such deals should be minimised
our worry is not just that if we clean up everything what happens is there will be no buyers or capital flow coming in
remember that there is a capital flight from the region at the moment said one concerned official
he said authorities are now trying to sell assets in blocks to allow the value to be spread out between the good and bad assets and minimise a sudden and huge unemployment situation
that is time consuming and thailand does not have time he said foreign loans are being recalled and the baht is tumbling because of excess demand for us dollars
time is thailand's biggest enemy
foreign capital must be brought in quickly the mathematics are very clear he said
there must be a breakthrough in passage of essential laws to facilitate the sale of assets to foreigners he said there must be cooperation among political parties specifically there is a need for a bankruptcy law which would allow for quick foreclosure
the chuan government has pledged to do this but does not seem to realise the need for urgency in seeking the political cooperation of other parties during the parliamentary session in february
its economic ministers have become bogged down in the day-to-day crisis he said

with the baht depreciating to more than 50 to the us dollar it will be impossible for thai entrepreneurs to wait for sweet returnsliberalisation in both financial and trade areas now forces them to adjust to ensure their survival
david llewellyn professor of money and banking loughborough university in his report on the financial system and economic development praised thailand for its liberalisation moves in the financial arena and said thailand's financial services will be the most liberal in southeast asia
however to neil semple an assistant director at abn amro hoare govett asia investment research ltd the recent lifting of banks' foreign ownership restrictions is not sufficient if thailand aims to be a regional financial centre he added that thailand also has to improve personnel to meet any financial changes
financial liberalisation will also have an impact on local employment as laid-off finance workers who can adjust to the changes might be re-hired in the finance sector on the opposite side more finance workers might also be laid off because new foreign partners may bring along new technology and their own financial experts
according to llewellyn if supervision is not intensified at the same time as the financial system is liberalised the financial system may become crisis prone there is something of a trade-off between regulation and supervision in that if regulation is eased to allow firms to conduct more business there is an increased requirement for effective supervision of the way that business is conducted liberalisation not accompanied by more intensive supervision would lead to a financial crisis
interest rates may become more volatile in the first phase of liberalisation and increased volatility has an impact on asset prices which in turn may adversely affect the balance sheet positions of financial institutions
liberalisation may also reveal inherent weaknesses in the banking system both with respect to structure and the traditional way of conducting business llewellyn saidthe money markets will be affected from the liberalisation and in the transitional period of change there will be fluctuations in stock and currency trading liberalisation will result in faster shifts of capital inflows and outflows causing domestic investors to be more careful and adjust to the changes
despite the problems which might arise following liberalisation the adjustments by the public and private sectors will render many great benefits
while many thai bankers from banking families are afraid foreigners could strip them of their wealth llewellyn said foreign partners will bring capital into the financial system it is generally the case that competition which develops from outside a system tends to have a greater impact on competition and efficiency than a purely internal competition the existence of experienced foreign institutions also facilitates the attraction of capital inflows to augment domestic savings
moreover foreign institutions tend to be less prone to domestic political pressures while conducting their business they are also less susceptible to local euphoria which can lead to excessive lending and over-optimistic expectations he said
on the trade liberalisation side thailand is expecting to further reduce its trade barriers in line with the upcoming full implementation of the asean free trade agreement afta by 2003 that will result in lower domestic prices due to more competition moreover it would be more convenient for thai exporters to seek overseas funds
some economists said the dismantling of protection and the role of the board of investment which promoted investments in inappropriate sectors that caused surplus production capacity was partially to blame for the current economic crisis
however it was not the fault of the boi or of the trade promotion agency since the agency worked to meet the trade policy guided by the government said dale weigel general manager of the world bank group's foreign investment advisory service
dennis encarnation and louis wells of harvard university agreed that although deregulation and the dismantling of protection were partially responsible for the instability associated with foreign direct investment from abroad foreign direct investment usually brings management skills technology and access to markets abroad

residents of a 22-year-old building in cheung sha wan gave only a lukewarm reception to a fire drill staged on sunday
only about 150 people living in the old commercial and residential building dashed out on hearing the fire alarm
some of the households just sent representatives to join in the exercise
i had to do the housework so i asked my husband and children to join it said a housewife
the fire manoeuvre was jointly organised by the fire services department and the sham shui po district office in the wake of a series of deadly fires in the past few months
a department spokesman said the department could not force residents to join the fire drill and expressed disappointment at the lukewarm response
at least the department had successfully sent a clear message asking the residents to beware of fire and to be more conscious of the need for fire prevention he said
there were two major fires last year _ in january when the top one karaoke bar was razed resulting in the deaths of 17 people and in april in mei foo sun chuen where eight people perished
the spokesman attributed the fatal fires to public ignorance of fire prevention measures sunday's exercise was one of the activities organised to enhance public awareness

bankers said the market should not expect too much from the bank of thailand's latest move to increase its contribution to the exim bank's packing credit scheme as credit risk lies at the heart of the problem
last week the central bank decided to increase its contribution ratio to 60 per cent while commercial banks will contribute the remaining 40 per cent the ratio was previously 5050to encourage commercial banks to lend more to exporters the authorities also raised the interest rate ceiling on the packing credit from 12 per cent to 13 per cent meaning the banks could earn up to 25 per cent on their portion of the creditthe bot will consider reducing the provision rate for letter of credit backed risk assets from 20 per cent while banks have to set 100 per cent aside in provisions for unguaranteed loans
bankers agreed that the move to raise the interest rate was sensible considering the high cost of funds in the overnight loan market currently quoted at more than 20 per cent''exporters have been charged less than borrowers in other sectors for a long time though the interest rate for packing credit was raised from 12 per cent to 13 per cent it is still cheap and makes sense banks would consider it worthwhile to lend montira utarapichat vice president of bank of asia said
however several bankers believe that the more relaxed packing credit contribution ratio will benefit only large companies such as charoen pokaphan group which have good credit ratings
the increasing contribution from the bot will add liquidity but commercial banks still have to bear 100 per cent of the risk so the cash is expected to reach only companies with good credit ratings we still consider the credit risk of borrowers to be the most important criteria small companies with bt200 million to bt300 million in sales will not benefit from the revised rule a banker from a thai bank said
he said the exporters which have complained of difficultly borrowing from commercial banks are mostly small companies currently bt11 billion of the bt33 billion to be contributed by the central bank remains unused commercial banks would have to lend about bt73 billion to exporters to meet the 40-per-cent contribution ratio
despite sufficient liquidity some commercial banks reportedly refuse to extend loans to exporters because they are not ready to increase their capital to maintain their capital adequacy ratio within bank for international settlement requirements net-lender banks prefer lending to the bot via the repurchase market instead since the credit risk is zero while the return is as much as 23 to 25 per cent
the cause of the liquidity shortage however remains unsolved
short-term interest rates currently maintained at 23 to 25 per cent to try and stabilise the baht have failed to function in the way the authorities would like as the baht continues to head downwardthe market is asking regulators to reduce short-term interest rates as an exchange rate of bt54 against the dollar is not substantially different to bt60 to the dollar or more because at either rate local companies will not be able to repay their foreign debts for months
some bankers even suggested that the central bank may have to lend to exporters itself through the industrial finance corporation of thailand or the export and import bank to pump liquidity into the export sector

although the new year has arrived the still-unclear picture of the financial sector as well as macro-economic uncertainties are keeping the thai bourse in the doldrums with stock analysts expecting the situation to remain unfavourable throughout the year
aside from psychological reasons which drove the baht to a new low and hampered the stock index in the past week other factors to dictate the direction of the bourse this year include possible problems with financial institutions' recapitalisation plans and the prolonged economic recession
pakhawat kovithvathanaphong chief executive officer of securities one plc said two main factors to affect stock prices are listed firms' operating performances and external factors including interest rates'at the moment the external factors have more impact on the stock prices and investments than other factors he said
his comment was backed by the index fall on friday as investors feared another baht fall would cause the economy to deteriorate further certainly with the high short-term money markets no thai company could escape the negative impactsthe plunge of regional stock markets and the deterioration of the thai baht caused the stock exchange of thailand index on friday to fall 1050 points or 292 per cent to 34967 the set index on friday was at the lowest level in a decade
to sriyarn pietersz crosby securities ltd research head the fall will not be temporary this year as he believes the thai bourse will not stabilise until the middle of 1999
he anticipates that during the period not only financial institutions but also non-finance corporates will need recapitalisation however the liquidity crunch will force them to find strategic partners for the desired money until they receive the money the capital base will remain weak
according to pietersz the set index will take between nine and 18 months to recover however the time period will depend on the thai government's capability to tackle the country's financial crisis
the set index will experience its bottom point only after there is not much value left in the unhealthy businesses in thailand pietersz said
kawee chookitkasem of capital nomura securities plc agreed that the recovery will take at least a year''bad news will not be over until asset prices collapse and foreign investors inject money he said
technically the bottom point for the set index is 250 points but fundamentally the bottom point for the set index is unpredictable because the currency has a major effect on the set index he said
viroj nualkhair chairman of phatra thanakit plc said the thai capital market after the year 2000 will be on an upward trend because the market will be more open for investors the thai capital market size will be double that of its money market which is now tuned at bt6 trillion with the entries of new financial products
it will take three years from 1998 to 2000 to create a strong capital market since the 45 still-operating securities firms in thailand need time to adjust and restructure their businesses he said
until then the stock exchange of thailand will see many changes
among the expected changes kawee said is the weighting structure which gives great weight to the banking and finance sectors when calculating the set index which is based on the daily price changes of 50 of the largest-capitalised stocksin the past the combined market capitalisation of banking and finance stocks accounted for 37 per cent of the total of the 50 stocks once the financial sector showed signs of weakness the index thus fell sharply even though some of the non-finance firms were doing fine
last year as the financial sector plunged it came as no surprise when the stock index crashed more than 55 per cent from the beginning of 1997 the financial sector was expected to be in trouble following the failed merger of thai danu bank and finance one plckawee thinks the banking and finance sectors' weight is too high and he suggested it should be altered
as 24 listed finance firms have been permanently closed the 50-stock list now welcomes replacements which include those from the entertainment sector such as bec world plc
to vikit kachornnarongvanich of amsteel securities thailand plc three years after thailand gets through its economic and financial crisis the thai capital market will be more mature because there will be more financial products in the market as well as more institutional players to invest in the thai bourse thai investors also must have more analytical skills and global perspectives
to thanisorn dejthamrong kiatnakin finance and securities plc's research chief the painful period will finally give way to favourable results
the mexico stock index rose 60 to 70 per cent two years after its market fell to the bottom the index became more stable at such a level there will be more competition in the market he said

leading the annual new territories charity walk are from left provisional regional council chief lau wong-fat sir donald tsang and community chest executive committee chief charles lee picture felix wong financial secretary sir donald tsang yam-kuen gave a firm assurance on sunday that he would remain prudent in using budgetary measures to stimulate a financial recovery
it the budget must be very cautious in considering how to stimulate the economy sir donald said
the measures may include the lowering of tax rates and increased public expenditure
sir donald said he would reveal the government's strategy to pierce the economic gloom in the special administrative region's first budget on 18 february
the financial chief is delivering the budget weeks earlier than its traditional march date so it can be voted on by the provisional legislative council before the may legislative elections
sir donald will be urged to give generous tax cuts and allowances and to spend on big projects amid the economic doldrums
he sits on reserves projected to reach $377 billion by 31 march
meanwhile liberal party provisional legislator allen lee peng-fei said the pressure of the asian economic turmoil on hong kong had just started and was likely to intensify after the lunar new year
mr lee said it would be impossible for hong kong people to live through the financial crisis without confronting difficulty even peregrine investment holdings with its expertise in both stock and foreign exchange markets had been dragged into the storm he said
mr lee advised people to get ready to tighten their belts in the coming months
he said the hang seng index had reached its lowest point in the past few years not just because of the earnings capability of listed companies but also through a lack of confidence by the hong kong people
he said the index would continue to fall under a high-interest rate regime
meanwhile hong kong confederation of trade unions general secretary lee cheuk-yan accused the government of going ahead with the importation of labour despite the financial crisis
it is impossible for the economy of hong kong to escape the crisis
in my opinion more workers will be laid off in the coming months he said the situation now was worse than in 1995 and he expected more people to apply for comprehensive social security assistance
president boris yeltsin will visit italy next month and meet with pope john paul ii the kremlin said monday in an apparent attempt to help patch up relations with the vatican
in the meantime the roman catholic church and russian orthodox church announced they would resume talks that broke off during the summer and try once again to arrange a first-ever meeting of the pope and russian patriarch
during yeltsin's visit feb 9-11 he also will hold talks with italian president oscar luigi scalfaro and prime minister romano prodi and travel to bologna said presidential spokesman sergei yastrzhembsky
the russian president first met john paul on a trip to rome in december 1991
the spokesman refused to give any details of yeltsin's agenda or elaborate on what he will discuss with the pope issues of interest to both the vatican and russia are to be discussed yastrzhembsky said
a likely subject is a new russian law on religion which enshrined orthodoxy as the leading faith while curbing the rights of other churches
the measure which yeltsin signed into law in september drew a squall of protests from abroad including from the vatican the pope had personally pleaded with yeltsin to block the legislation
the president is on vacation in northwestern russia and will be back in the kremlin next monday yastrzhembsky said yeltsin canceled two international summits planned for later this month giving rise to renewed concern about his health after his hospitalization with a bad cold last month
yastrzhembsky promised to release footage of the vacationing president later this week to ease the media's nervousness he said yeltsin would continue to maintain an active schedule while on holiday meeting with first deputy prime minister boris nemtsov on tuesday and holding regular phone conversations with russian officials and foreign leaders
also monday the russian orthodox church and the vatican announced they would resume talks in moscow on tuesday and wednesday to try to resolve their differences and prepare for a meeting of their leaders it would be the first such encounter since the great schism of 1054 split the christian faith into orthodox and catholic beliefs
the pope and patriarch alexy ii had planned to meet in austria last summer but alexy canceled because of unresolved disputes with the vatican over church property and catholic missionary work in russia
the russian church _ which claims to be the largest of orthodoxy's 15 main branches _ objects to efforts by western churches including the roman catholic church to seek converts in russia and other regions it considers traditionally orthodox it was behind the new law on religion which has made proselytizing by foreign churches more difficult
the vatican delegation will be led by cardinal edward cassidy head of the pontifical council for the promotion of christian unity while the russian orthodox church will be represented by kirill metropolitan of smolensk and kaliningrad

towards the year 2000 the securities and exchange commission sec and the stock exchange of thailand set will be adopting stricter regulations and trying to balance the wide-open free market
securities firms are adjusting their business strategies in preparation for the upcoming changesthe authorities have to tighten rules in order to build a stronger capital market but because of the liquidity crunch they also have to allow more flexibilityon the long-term development of the thai capital market the government will turn to important basic issues such as good governance amongst listed companies actually the issues have been included in the sec management plan for years however past economic prosperity discouraged their implementation
according to set president singh tangtatswas the financial crisis has led to the set abolishing its five-year development plan under the current economic situation the set was not sure about clear-cut policy developments because many factors kept arisingprasarn trairatvorakul deputy secretary-general of the sec said the securities industry now welcomes greater foreign participation while requiring little operating capital securities trading is a business from which foreign investors will receive great benefits
still the authorities are undecided about maximum foreign ownership as well as the number of director seats to be allocated to the securities firms' foreign partners the scope of business of the firms should also be evaluated prasarn said
amaret sila-on the new set chairman agreed that larger foreign participation will improve the efficiency of local players especially in the securities trading area
don't think that larger foreign stakes will lead to total intrusion over the thai businesses what we should do now is think how we can attract foreigners as that will provide benefits rather than disadvantages he said
singh said the set might adjust some listing rules and regulations in line with the current economic conditionpresently listed firms are required to set up an audit committee to ensure their accounting transparency and disclosure future adjustments might include changing the listing requirements regarding the minimum initial capital and market capitalisation of firms wishing to be listed the silent period might be shortened if the listed firms' size is small
due to the current volatility the set said the short selling and stock lending activities planned for introduction this year might be scrapped

chinese dissident wei jingsheng heaped praise on former hong kong governor chris patten during a two-hour meeting at the weekend in london
a spokesman said the two discussed a wide range of human rights issues in china and asia in general including mr wei's experiences in mainland jails
the two men said afterwards they were pleased with their meeting
mr patten compared mr wei's struggles to those of south africa's president nelson mandela and burma's democracy leader aung san suu kyi currently under house arrest
he said freedoms and democracy were important issues throughout the world and he would campaign for them
mr wei said he had heard about the former governor indirectly through newspaper and television reports and felt he had done a lot for the chinese in hong kong
the dissident praised mr patten _ both the politician and the man _ but expressed disappointment that foreign secretary robin cook was unable to find time to see him during his current visit to london
mr wei felt the foreign secretary would have found time to see chinese leaders such as president jiang zemin
the dissident will see foreign office minister derek fatchett on monday but has expressed concern about visits to china by senior western leaders including those by mr cook later this month
he said there was nothing wrong with having a dialogue but at a time when the human rights and democratic situation was deteriorating it could not be seen as an encouraging sign
mr wei adopted by amnesty international as a prisoner of conscience was released from jail in the mainland in november on medical grounds and travelled to the united states for treatment
he is due to visit france this week where he is scheduled to address the french national assembly's foreign affairs committee
divers will this week inspect a cargo vessel which sank off the south african coast in 1996 hoping to make the indian owners compensate families of the 29 crew members who perished the organizers said monday
the dlrs 200000 expedition to the cordigliera is being organized by the london-based international transport workers' federation and the south african department of transport the union said in a statement
the panamanian-registered vessel foundered in november 1996 in heavy seas in the indian ocean it lies at a depth of 300 feet some four miles 65 kms off the coast of port st johns
the cordigliera with an all-indian crew was owned by an indian company sinha shipping and insured through a british company ocean p and i club
the expedition hopes to find out why the cordigliera built at a british shipyard in 1979 sank how it was loaded and the extent of damage
this joint expedition is being undertaken because it will benefit not only the families of the seafarers whose lives were lost but also send a clear message to the shipping industry that it cannot escape punishment for its liabilities said mark dickinson the union's assistant general secretary

against the pessimistic view from some investment bankers that the closure of 54 finance companies marked the end of the bond market others opine the crisis will push the thai bond market to an exciting position in the years ahead
viroj nualkhair chairman of finance firm phatra thanakit plc commented that the size of the bond market can be as large as the money market provided the economic fundamentals fall back to normal''experience will tell private companies that bonds are a necessary borrowing instrument with their fixed costs he said
the bond market plunged when the financial authorities suspended the operations of 16 finance companies in june of the 16 companies finance one plc was the most active issuer and dealer in the bond marketthe suspension thus discouraged the trading of fin-one bonds and those of other finance companies on fears that the companies might be unable to meet their obligations prior to the suspensions the bond market enjoyed a daily trading volume of over bt1 billion however the volume fell sharply to less than bt100 million per day currentlymost bankers do not believe the bond market will recover soon because the high interest environment is unfavourable for bond issuers while the repurchase rate in december was around 25 per cent new bonds need to offer a coupon which must be as high as the repo rate
last year was the most distressing for all bond investors including fund management companies as investors lost confidence in the bond market the fund management companies witnessed heavy redemptions according to the association of investment management companies 33 fixed-income funds which invest mainly in the bond market were shut down last year as of dec 4 the fixed-income fund industry size fell to bt23 billion from bt87 billion at the end of 1996
teera phutrakul president of the association commented that if bond disclosure is perfected investors will be more confident about channelling money into the bond market
while most investment bankers believe the bond market will take more than five years to recover viroj believes the thai economy will start to rise again in the year 2001 and the bond market will shine again in the next three years
then there will be more sophisticated bonds to serve mutual funds and provident funds which prefer long-term investments while government bonds are scarce he said
teera ashakul senior vice-president of the industrial finance corp of thailand research department also has a bright view for the bond market'in the next three to five years the bond market will be the most exciting marketplace the baht float raises the foreign loan risks and local corporates will have to turn to the bond market he said
moody's investors service an international rating agency has downgraded the foreign currency rating of thai corporate bonds to junk bond status that will force local companies to offer higher interest rates to attract foreign investors
teera foresees the bank of thailand and the government issuing bonds in the domestic market and a series of bot bonds if the central bank's inflation-controlling role becomes more concentrated
while the thai bond market is not expected to improve until 2001 the us market is likely to boom this year thanks in large measure to the financial crunch in several pacific basin nations however worldwide economic growth seems likely to slow down in those circumstances most us analysts think the extraordinary profit growth enjoyed by legions of us companies in recent years will lose much of its momentum
that's a potentially large problem for wall street even as stock indexes have hit record highs again this year investors have been quick to dump individual stocks whose earnings showed the slightest sign of faltering
we think the us fixed-income market along with other dollar-linked bond markets may be the place to be in 1998 1998 is likely to be an uninspiring year for stock prices robert doll executive vice-president at oppenheimer funds inc said he manages a us$80 billion fund in new yorkcertainly while the thai stock market could remain in the doldrums this year the bond market could benefit from the rise in the us bond market it is unwise to rule out such positive spill-over affects copyright 1998 nation all rights reserved as distributed by worldsources online inc

the 36-member hong kong delegation to the ninth national people's congress is expected to once again have only two representatives on the standing committee
and the second seat is expected to go to xinhua news agency director jiang enzhu who received the highest number of votes 397 in last month's election
incumbent member tsang hin-chi is likely to retain the other seat
a senior npc deputy told the hong kong standard both the central government and the congress traditionally preferred minor changes during the transition from one term to another
in order to balance various political forces inside the standing committee the npc's decision-making body and the continuity of the operation of the whole npc it is certain that both the central government and the npc standing committee will prefer less change he said
the fewer the changes the more stable the situation will be in the last npc session former xinhua head zhou nan and mr tsang represented the 28 hong kong deputies on the standing committee
the number of local deputies was increased to 36 in last month's election for the ninth npc
they will fly to beijing to attend the first plenary meeting starting on 5 march
they will join other deputies from different parts of the mainland in the npc to vote on the membership of the standing committee
mr tsang has proposed to the current standing committee that the number of representatives of the hong kong delegation be increased to three
but another deputy ng hong-mun strongly opposed the suggestion
it is understood mr ng who is also interested in the post might be mr tsang's strongest rival
but the senior deputy said on sunday he believed mr tsang would retain his seat as it would mean less change adding that it would be better for hong kong people if mr jiang sat on the committee

the bank of thailand policy to maintain high interest rates to defend the baht has failed to save the baht from a downhill ride causing corporates to seek dollars with abnormally high swap rates dealers and treasurers said
as the baht plunged below 50 to the us dollar last week dealers complained the bot policy has been unsuccessful in shoring up the thai currency as demand for dollar remains hugeconsequently thai corporates had to face a high swap rate dictated by the local money market rate and the difference between us and local lending rates on friday the 1-month swap rate offshore soared to 130/170 satang compared with 87/107 satang just a day earlier the 2-month and 3-month rates rose to 200/230 satang and 260/300 satang respectively
the 6-month rate escalated to 550/600 satang from thursday's quote of 400/450 satang the 12-month rate shot up to 900/1000 satang compared with 650/700 satang a day earlier certainly dealers had never witnessed this when the baht-dollar exchange was in its usual range
a dealer from a bangkok-based american bank said that swap rates for every period are high amid the regional currency crisis the higher interest rates remain the higher the swap rate will be while the battered baht keeps on sliding
the bot policy does nothing to stabilise the baht because we all see the unit fall to a series of new lows almost every week he added
a dealer at the bank of ayudhya noted that thai corporates are facing hefty swap rates due chiefly to the wide spread in interest rates between thailand and the united states
currently the us lending rate stands around 7 per cent or about 800 basis points below thailand's highest prime rate which is now in the range of 1475-1525 per cent
the prescription ordered by the international monetary fund imf under the austerity economic bail-out programme for thailand has drawn widespread criticism from players who have to deal with dollar-baht exchange rates
dealers said the finance authorities should review the package with imf officials at the end of this month
finance minister tarrin nimmanhaeminda will travel to washington to meet the imf possibly to review some severe conditions of the bail-out package a lot of factors have changed drastically since the package was implemented and the deeply deteriorating economy cannot be improved by the strict conditions
as time goes by it may be about time to relax some conditions otherwise we seem to face more and more pain a senior dealer at the local bank said
deputy prime minister supachai panitchpakdi earlier admitted keeping interest rates high to defend the baht as required by the imf has made it more difficult for the country to find a way out of the economic crisissupachai said this matter may be put on the agenda for the urgent package review
we all know this does more harm than good he noted
satain tantansarit senior vice-president of thai danu bank believes the imf should fully understand the worsening economic situation and realise thailand followed the conditions in good faithmonthira ultrapichat head of the bank of asia treasury department said thai corporates are struggling to keep their businesses afloat while interest rates remain at high levelsmeanwhile the baht direction this week is likely to depend on both internal and external factors however the bot's latest measure to curb speculative activities failed to make a good impression on dealers who fear the baht will experience a turbulent week
it is a ridiculous measure the bot does not solve problems at the right point and the market is expected to react today a dealer at a foreign bank based in bangkok complained
commercial banks could suffer the maximum penalty of having their foreign exchange trading licences revoked if they are involved in baht speculation the central bank also vowed to check every foreign exchange trading transaction below us$5000
last week the baht hit a series of new lows before falling to 54-5410 to the greenback
the indonesian rupiah was in meltdown mode as the unit was fast approaching 10500 to the dollar amid widespread doubt about the government's ability to overcome the financial crisis

with the baht continuing to fall to new lows last week along with the dramatic battering of the indonesian rupiah which lost more than 20 per cent in a single trading day import businesses have been driven to near-panic and some have temporarily stopped to come to terms with the new environment the business desk reports
as opposed to exporters who enjoy benefits from the falling baht importers are experiencing more trouble many have temporarily suspended their activities as they were losing sight of the business outlook
at bt53-54 to the us dollar more than double the rate prior to the july 2 de facto devaluation import costs have jumped beyond imagination we have stopped our import activities for some time already since the sharp plunge of the baht produces a high impact on the price of the imported products and the opportunity to sell the products to customers an executive of boonrawd trading co said
we have ceased to import since some time before the new year the impact is high because the price will go up a lot she added
thai exports in 1997 rose by 27 per cent in baht terms from the previous year while the country recorded a trade surplus in the last four months of 1997 of bt8421 billion the trade deficit for the entire year decreased to bt114144 billion according to the customs department
imports in december amounted to bt1764 billion an increase of 2572 per cent compared to the same period last year the total import value last year amounted to bt19 trillion an increase of only 4 per cent from the previous year
the same executive said some employees directly involved in import activities are now idle she said she did not know when the company would begin importing liquor again an important factor is for the baht to become stable
we're clearing items that customers ordered before and we have some documents to be worked out she saidjim kelly inchcape regional director said two months ago he talked with several traders who had stopped their import activities while waiting for the baht to recover at that time the baht stood at only 39 to the us dollar today the baht is around 53 to the us dollar who knows if it will hit 60 next week he asked we cannot guess the future of the baht whether it will be worse or recover but business has to continue he added
according to kelly importers now try to use old stock which they purchased with a stronger baht to lessen the effect on the price of imports if the baht continues to weaken traders cannot do anything but increase their prices when the old stock runs outkelly said the baht devaluation has created a favourable effect on inchcape's contract manufacturing business by boosting exports about 30 per cent of its manufactured products are for export inchcape recently signed a contract with bristol myers to be the regional production point for their shampoo products
meanwhile the group's lifestyle brand is receiving negative impacts from the baht flotation because of the direct higher costs of imported goods
1998 will be a difficult year for business but 1999 and 2000 are expected to be better said kelly adding that the economy will recover and business will go on
a source from diethelm's special products division said the company is negotiating with brand owners overseas to offer some financial assistance
we talked with our principals on what has happened to our costs and how they can help us the source said we have to keep our business running at least to serve our regular customers who demand necessary goods he said however the company has to control its stock and reduce its inventory of high-priced items
the company is studying its prices which have been affected directly by the baht plunge the costs still have not been passed on to the customers however the source said he does not know for how long the company can keep the same prices
sucha thisayakorn assistant vice-president berli jucker photo division a distributor of agfa films and photo goods said the company also delayed its import deals and activities to prevent exchange rate losses as they cannot predict the direction of the baht no one knows at what level the baht will go to not even the finance minister he noted but we cannot quit our business he added
sucha said that the company has started discussions with creditors about rolling over loans
there is nothing to guarantee our risk from importing products with the high plunge of the baht we sell imported products at a loss complained sucha adding that it is a better option to delay those activitiesthe baht plunge not only impacts imported finished products but also parts and accessories especially in the electronics industry
philips electronics thailand has seen rises in the raw material prices for its television factory meanwhile about 30 per cent of its audio-visual products are imported
we have to review our three-month plan set previously as the baht has plunged rapidly and we cannot cope with the new exchange rate said chuti unakul assistant director of marketing
chuti believes all independent importers have stopped importing but companies with top-brand products including philips cannot give up those activities instead they reduce their imports
he complained that the plunge of the baht will affect not only current or future imports but also those which have already been imported using credit importers have to pay their credit charges with the deeply depreciated bahtwithout doubt the plunge of the baht will cause higher prices and result in lower demand however chuti is still confident about certain audio-visual products copyright 1998 nation all rights reserved as distributed by worldsources online inc

un officials are proposing that the world body double the value of iraq's oil sales under the oil-for-food program a un spokesman said here monday
if the un security council approves the move iraq will be pumping about 16 million barrels per day on to the already saturated oil market by february said dennis halliday the un relief coordinator in iraq
halliday told the associated press that un and iraqi experts were reviewing the current program which allows the sale of dlrs 2 billion worth of oil every six months to enable the government to buy food medicine and other humanitarian supplies for its 22 million people
halliday said among the recommendations due to be finalized this week was a proposal for the un security council to take a decision which will increase iraqi revenues by 100 percent or even more
the recommendation was to implement such an increase during the current six-month phase of the program the third since it began in december 1996 halliday said
the boost was needed to rehabilitate iraq's drinking water facilities and upgrade the power grid
halliday said the oil-for-food scheme has done very little to alleviate the suffering of the iraqis under the sweeping un trade sanctions imposed after iraq's 1990 invasion of kuwait
he said he would be forwarding the recommendations to un secretary-general kofi annan who is expected to put them before the security council at the end of january
halliday was optimistic the security council would approve the recommendation
under the current six-month phase iraq plans to pump 800000 barrels per day but with the recommendation this would jump to about 16 million barrels per day
the exact volume of iraqi exports would be determined by prices on the international market lower prices would mean more oil was exported
meantime an iraqi oil official said monday that his government has signed its first contracts under the program's third phase
speaking on condition of anonymity the official said the french oil companies elf aquitaine and total would be the first to pump on board the kirkuk sour grade of crude from the southern turkish terminal of ceyhan later this week lb-jbm

risk management by local importers must be efficient during the wilder fluctuations of the dollar/baht exchange rate or the firms might not survive
as the embattled baht fails to achieve stability most importers who are familiar with the fixed exchange rate regime of the past 13 years are unsure of how to deal with the current situation
it is reported that some import firms have ceased their business activities since the baht has fallen below 50 to the us dollar
dealers spelt out clearly that only good risk management would help importers stay afloat during the difficult period
satian tantanasarit senior vice-president of thai danu bank treasury department suggested importers buy forward contracts if their foreign repayments come due within a short period
this is the best protection for importers right now other financial products are not currently used in thailand he added
in other international markets corporates are able to buy an option contract to hedge against currency risks
however satian noted that this method is not popular in thailand as the premium is relatively high while the baht has been highly volatile since the flotation the more volatility the higher the premiuman option buyer has the right to buy call or sell put to an option seller when the contract matures
in addition satian noted importers should fully understand the market where it has been totally changed
they have to closely monitor the baht movement every day to efficiently manage their businesses he added
monthira utarapichat head of bank of asia's treasury department noted that importers should refrain from ordering goods from the united states if they are unnecessary
instead they should order goods from other asian countries such as south korea or indonesia where local currencies have plunged dramatically their operating costs will be much cheaper
importers should reap the full benefits from the regional currency crisis if we can buy products from our region we should do so monthira explained
a dealer at a bangkok-based american bank suggested another choice for risk management an export/import company should deposit dollars from their exports into a foreign currency deposit fcd account and use them to pay for imports the company will be charged to open the fcd account but this is much cheaper than the large spread between bid and offer rates he saidhowever any company wanting to open an fcd account is required to have revenues higher than us$2000 per transaction and their foreign payments must come due within three months
according to the thai bankers association's rule to transfer dollars into the fcd account a company will be charged 025 per cent of the total amount and a commission fee of bt100 as a minimum and bt500 as a maximum
to transfer dollars from the fcd account the company will also be charged 025 per cent of the total amount with a minimum bt300 commissiondealers said local exporters should not hoard dollars and some agreed the dollar's strength will not stay at this high level for long but will come down in the near future
sutee losoponkul vice-president of nakornthon bank warned dollar hoarders that the greenback will not jump much higher than the current level as it is almost near its peak he also sees a turning point for the dollar and baht sometime during this year
dealers commended the government's move to launch measures to prevent dollar hoarding some said exporters could become less competitive as the period for holding dollars is cut
we have to be careful about the period cut if there is any negative impacts to exporters it means our country will also be in trouble as export-oriented industries are the key for thailand's economic growth a source from a local large bank commented

asians cannot get along without democratic government hong kong's top democrat martin lee chu-ming asserts
the democratic party chairman said on rthk's letter to hong kong on sunday that the financial crisis in the region had exploded the myth that asians do better without democracy
representative government would provide a solid foundation for financial success he stressed mr lee said asian leaders tended to ignore the bad and talk only about the good and to hide the facts from the people as far as possible
he described this phenomenon as asian flu in a political sense
mr lee criticised the government here for trying to suppress the truth about bird flu at first then blaming the media for reporting it he said there was a thread _ the lack of representative government _ linking the bird flu and the financial crisis together
it was a mistake to think that as long as the economy was all right democracy would not be needed
the past few months have shown us that without a democratic government you cannot just rest on your laurels he warned
people should remember they could mot expect all the things that they had today to continue to exist without fighting for them

the budget bureau has prepared a preliminary zero-growth budget for fiscal 1999 based on a projection of continuing economic difficulty
guidelines for the 1999 budget for october 1998 to september 1999 were last thursday circulated to the finance ministry and state enterprises asking them to adopt revised criteria on spending cuts
the key objective is to maintain or increase national competitiveness so spendings on eastern seaboard commercial research and development projects tourism-related and other service sectors will be given top priority on the budget of bt800 billionhowever for the slim possibility of economic recovery the budget has given them a flexibility of 5 per cent budget growth said a senior officialthe 5 per cent extra will be slashed if the government income does not meet spending targets and secondary priority projects will be abandoned
the ministries and state enterprises are required to give priority to enhancing exports promoting the tourism and service businesses and lessening social problems arising from the economic crisis
among other non-preferred projects are small irrigation projects bus terminals or airports in the provinces foreign offices and projects requiring imported raw materialsthe ministries and state enterprises are asked to downsize and decentralise their operations and to dispatch officials and funds to local administration units the guidelines promote natural sciences mathematics and foreign languages while discouraging social sciences such as law humanities and education
the budget guidelines of 1999 are in line with the 8th national economic and social development plan which has been adjusted to the international monetary fund's austerity programmethe budget bureau suggests the following urgent measures to increase national competitivenessrestructuring of the agricultural sector-emphasis on the potential of each regional area for unique development and production with minimal affects on the environment-promote the addition of value on agro-industry and farm processing products and increase productivity
enhance the efficiency of production and reduce production costs in regions where they can still sustain their competitiveness for the export marketrestructuring of the industrial sector - support production efficiency and technology developments for potential export and supporting industries which could lead to the reduction of imported raw material and parts - promote the start-to-end pipeline production industries-strengthen the collaboration between small and medium-sized and community industries with main industries in order to decentralise the concentration of industries in the citiespromoting foreign direct investment and expanding export markets -support the industries particularly those will use domestic agricultural raw materials-diversify the export markets
increase trade negotiation bargaining power to protect thailand's interests and to solve trade fiction and develop the database for trade cooperation with counterparts
improving product quality and standards - promote iso 9000 product quality and iso 14000 environment management-improve packing for farm and manufacturing export productsregarding the tourism and service industries the budget guidelines suggest the following-strive for international standards for tourism industries-sell thailand abroad through public relation activities and provide a better information service-campaign for impressive comfortable and secure travel in thailand
rehabilitate and conserve natural tourism sites to maintain the rich and diversified natural resources-achieve the best service and skilled labour in the hotel and other related service industries-make thailand the centre for service industries particularly recreational and hospital educational and consulting in order to earn more hard currencythe ministries must support self-employment training programmes and the seeking of overseas jobs
another important aspect of the new budget allocations is to increase the role of the permanent secretary of every ministry to scrutinise or revoke projects proposed by its departments said a senior officialthe full details of the budget will be submitted to the cabinet for approval by april 28

private hospitals which have seen the number of patients fall by more than 20 per cent since the bursting of the bubble economy are being encouraged to join a uniform pricing scheme organised by the ministry of public health as state hospitals have seen an influx of patients unwilling to go to private hospitals because of the economic difficulty
the ministry will launch the programme in conjunction with private hospitals to help reduce the burden on state hospitals which have seen patients rise by 30 per cent since the middle of last year according to permanent secretary dr prakrom wutthipongse
the programme will have private hospitals posting standard prices for medicines and doctor's fees for common ailments
uniform pricing will allow people to know in advance the cost of treatment and hospitalisation so they may consider using more private hospital services instead of going to overcrowded state hospitals which are running beyond capacity
due to economic difficulty fewer people go to private hospitals where revenues have fallenuniform pricing will be voluntary according to dr prakrom
by charging uniform prices more people especially middle-income earners will feel private services are affordable
the government will announce details of the programme by the middle of this year he said
there are about 38000 private hospital beds nationwide half of which are in bangkok
uniform pricing will be a solution after many private hospitals suffering from the economic downturn and a sharp plunge in the number of patients have tried to consolidate their health-care businesses and considered merging with partnersthey are moving to overcome the economic difficulty as well as to improve liquidity and efficiency many private hospitals have reduced their inventories to create better cash flow
with the uniform price we can encourage people to come back to use the treatment services in private hospitals said prakrom
without the uniform pricing patients will become hesitant about using services in private hospitals as they do not know in advance the treatment charge said prakrom adding that many patients going to private hospitals have been upset because of prices higher than they expectedthe uniform pricing programme in private hospitals will also help to reduce the number of patients who shift their treatments to government hospitals
the economic recession caused more than 30 per cent of private hospital patients to be shifted to public hospitals this caused work overloads and bad debt problems prakrom said the number of out-patients at a state hospitals in surat thani jumped from 1200 a day to more than 1500 however its monthly income declined from bt19 million to only bt16 million as patients had no money to pay
the pricing programme will be available for private hospitals particularly medium-class hospitals and those located upcountry'an expectant mother will know the hospital's charge in advance whether she will be treated for a natural birth or a birth by caesarian section explained prakrom
according to prakrom the ministry will call a meeting with representatives of private hospitals wishing to participate in the programme to discuss ideas and calculate prices
the new pricing system will be calculated using many pricing sources including prices charged by private hospitals entering into social insurance as well as the price list used in state hospitalsprivate hospitals participating in the social insurance programme now charge 30 per cent more than state hospitalsprakrom said the ministry will urge the government and the board of investment to review the plan to promote the establishment of private hospitals especially in locations which are oversupplied

acting chief secretary for administration michael suen ming-yeung is satisfied with the outcome of the voter-registration drive
mr suen who as secretary for constitutional affairs is directly responsible for the campaign said the response from geographical constituency voters this year was actually better than the response in the 1995 election
but he admitted there had been a gap between the original expectation and the actual response
the government has been trying its very best already the result depends on the people mr suen said
the government will analyse the apparently lukewarm responses to the voter registration drive
many people have analysed the issue already we will study the case based on this analysis he said
he urged the public not to focus on the may election only in the future we will have many elections mr suen is confident the message about greater participation in politics has spread among the people the 3000 registration ambassadors the people close to them and those they had contacted would deliver the message he said
mr suen attended a fund-raising fun day organised by the hong kong girl guides association on sunday at the hong kong sports institute in sha tin
though he was a team leader of the sports day mr suen did not participate in any competitions but stayed with the spectators
i am very busy and have lots to discuss with my colleagues he explained

thai crisis calls for creative medicine

as the full brunt of the economic crisis bears down on thailand it is easy to see the glass as half empty every day brings more bad news and the resultant pessimism serves to further erode confidence
too often we hear reassurances that the downturn is only temporary and a recovery is just around the corner the more likely scenario is a deep drawn-out recession where economic equilibrium stabilises at a much lower level accompanied by high unemployment and negative gross domestic product rather than pessimism and false hopes what we really need are creative high impact solutions that can be implemented within the year
stepping back too far one of the pillars of thailand's economy has always been its agriculture export sector it is not surprising therefore that in response to the economic crisis the country steps back to re-think ways of exploiting opportunities in this area for example the bank of agriculture and agriculture cooperatives organised job programmes for unemployed city workers who drift back upcountry the bank of thailand provided funds to improve liquidity for exporters and the government negotiated trade cooperation with other asean countries and japan all these efforts help
the danger of stepping back however is that we step back too far and trip over ourselves in a crisis situation there is often a tendency to confuse searching for answers with seeking solace in the past the goal has to be clear we are stepping back to tap agricultural strengths not to retreat back to the good old days on the farm because the good old days no longer exist
in addition to exploring opportunities with agriculture exports we must solve other problems with our economy for instance traffic congestion and low productivity this requires building on recent accomplishments and moving forward by answering questions such as how are we better off today than we were 10 years ago what capabilities has thailand developed that distinguish it from other countries in the region what will provide the underlying support for real growth in the years to come
moving forward below i have tried to discuss novel ideas in four areas of thailand's economy - tourism education traffic and productivity these ideas may not be solutions per se but perhaps they will provoke people into thinking more outside the box tourism - expand the amazing thailand campaign why limit this campaign to tourism and only two years what happens after 1999 if thailand presents such a golden opportunity for tourism why not do something really amazing and make it the hub in southeast asia for business activities eg regional offices and conferences as well with the devaluation of the thai baht coupled with its strategic location deflated real estate prices and abundance of five-star hotels thailand offers an attractive alternative to hong kong and singapore
amazing thailand planners should not limit their programmes to advertising tourism overseas and promoting sales bonanzas at home like cities that have hosted the olympics they should use this event along with the asian games as an opportunity to drive substantive changes in city planning infrastructure and facilities the goal should not only be to attract tourists interested in rock bottom prices but also to convince overseas workers and business travellers who represent greater profits over the longer term that thailand is a desirable place to do business
education - create muang thong thani trade university as you travel away from bangkok towards chaeng wattana you see a virtual city of white buildings called muang thong thani these were originally constructed as a housing estate now desperately in search of tenants why not convert part of this project into a trade university make it the centre of adult education in southeast asia
multinationals and local companies could invest in this facility to train their employees locally instead of sending them overseas on expensive training courses money and education would flow into the country for a good cause think of the synergies of sharing ideas and best practices across industry sectors likely candidates might be car manufacturers telecom and banks who need to continuously upgrade skills and keep scores of employees current on the latest technologies sounds absurd no more absurd than malaysia's multimedia super corridor a concerted effort which if realistically timed will catapult malaysia into the 21st century in addition there are plenty of other vacant buildings in and around bangkok that could serve as satellite learning centres and public libraries
traffic - mandate cooperative parking time wasted in traffic reduces productivity more roads and transport services are needed but the planning and construction process takes too long other initiatives have mixed results and frustrate motorists such as constantly changing traffic patterns and endless repairs on potholes and drainage that never seem to last still others simply lack common sense like using helicopters to lift stalled vehicles from the road
what is needed are suggestions to bring commuters closer to their destinations to begin with why not create better access to parking in congested two-way traffic why should commuters have to go far out of their way just to get to the other side of the street to park buildings opposite each other should cooperate with joint parking privileges so commuters can choose which side of the street is most convenient to leave their cars the benefits are fewer u-turns a more direct commute and less time in traffic
productivity - outsource inefficiencies one way of eliminating inefficiencies is outsourcing services let's suppose you manufacture and sell bathroom fixtures a big chunk of your costs go to transport it wasn't always this way but over the years your costs climbed because you had to add overtime just to motivate truck drivers and their helpers to do their jobs pretty soon you owned the most expensive transport service in the industry
an alternative to reduce your costs and improve service is to outsource transport to ease the pain of layoffs you could convert company drivers to third party entrepreneurs let them own their own transportation business and be responsible for profit and loss the good drivers will reduce costs and still make money eventually they will deliver not only your products but products from other manufacturers as well funny how people behave differently when their own money and time are at stake
thailand's economic crisis presents both problems and solutions but if we are creative resourceful and maintain a positive outlook we will always see the glass as half full

the group played an influential role in pressuring the us and eu to agree to farm subsidy requirements during the uruguay round of trade talks
the source said thailand needed to maintain an active role in the group to promote the interests of the farm sector he said thailand should also think about a strategy to work with the cairns group to maximise the resources it has to benefit from the wto agreement which should enable thai farm exporters to sell moremeanwhile the commerce ministry this year has opened up the local market to imports of seven commodities according to its world trade organisation commitmentsupachai panitchpakdi deputy prime minister and commerce minister signed a letter on dec 29 guaranteeing the opening up of the domestic market to five farm products - bean oil coconut dried coconut coconut oil and palm oil including palm seed oilmembers have had to open up their markets to farm products from other members since 1995 thailand has allowed the import of 23 agricultural products some of which include rice corn tea leaves and sugarthis year the ministry has allowed 2209 tonnes of bean oil to be imported and 2350 tonnes of coconut imports the ministry set 8483 tonnes as the import quota for dried coconut and 3883 tonnes as the quota for coconut oil the palm oil quota is 4706 tonnesthe ministry set 241828 tonnes of rice last november as the 1998 quota and has allowed importers to import bean seeds since december

the national economic and social development board nesdb will propose the creation of a grassroots economic and social advisory council to advise the government on economic and social policies and the country's master development plan
the council would consist of representatives from each of the 76 provinces and at least 75 representatives from the academic and business communities
board president sippanondha ketudat said the creation of such a council was in accordance with the new constitution it would not be able to approve or veto government policy but would make suggestions about social and economic measures
the council would have three responsibilities to recommend draft social and economic plans which come out every five years to assess the results of the nesdb master plan every two and a half years and to be briefed about government policy before national addresses
sippanondha said that the new council would not duplicate the role of the nesdb because while the board was responsible for formulating policy the council would make recommendations in order to ensure that that policy truly reflected the public's needs
members would include representatives from such professions as banking tourism service automotive energy and petrochemicals
an nesdb working committee will iron out the details which include drafting legislation to legally create the council after the nesdb finalises the details it will send its proposal to deputy prime minister bhichai rattakul the chairman of a working committee considering constitutional bylaws

maj mark smith us retired is spot on once again with his assessment of the situation in cambodia in his letter of jan 9 he asserted that if hun sen like pol pot was to kill or order killed 40 or one million people the crime is the same murder and that the best you can do in such circumstances is to go for the leaders
the good major has made a major case for the fact that hun sen would likely be implicated in the cambodian genocide by an international tribunal investigating pol pot and the khmer rouge however as he did in his letter condemning international activists pushing for the eradication of landmines why was it that the amount of money requested by the activists to clean up the world's landmines was referred to by smith as outrageous overblown and indicative of profiteering while in the same letter he praised the us for thoroughly disposing of landmines in cambodia at a considerable cost smith has fired away with both barrels at the liberal media and the red menace without bringing up his own country's shortcomings
if it is best to go after the leaders smith might consider going after henry kissinger for his role in covertly carpet-bombing laos and cambodia during the vietnam war and the few living american leaders who were in power at the time of the my lai massacre after all whether you kill or order killed 40 or one million the crime is the same
if he prefers to indict leaders who were responsible for massive deaths within the borders of their own countries he might look to revise history books to paint president andrew jackson in a worse light for directing the trail of tears which saw at least 100000 seminoles cherokees and indians of other nations perish in the early 1800s
politicians faced the shadow of violence and a tight deadline as they resumed the search for a northern ireland peace settlement monday
the british and irish governments which cosponsor the talks presented a two-page plan for the eight participating parties to assess government spokesmen said the document sets priorities and an agenda for the coming weeks and would be published later monday
key issues up for negotiation would be a proposed lawmaking assembly for northern ireland currently governed directly from london new cross-border committees in which belfast assembly members would work alongside lawmakers from dublin and another new body that would bring belfast and dublin lawmakers together to seek common cause with english scottish and welsh lawmakers
if accepted by the participating parties the plan would clear the first hurdle on the course to negotiating a peace settlement for divided northern ireland
the negotiations began in june 1996 at stormont the center of british administration in east belfast under the direction of former us senate majority leader george mitchell
despite months of talks about talks at their last meeting dec 16 local politicians couldn't agree even on an agenda outlining what they should talk about

city workers used bulldozers as makeshift snowplows and children built yarmulke-clad snowmen as the first big snowfall in six years blanketed this ancient city on monday
more than a foot 50 cm of snow fell overnight in jerusalem and parts of the west bank drifting atop the yellow stone walls of the old city covering the slopes of the biblical mount of olives and coating the the golden dome of the rock islam's third-holiest shrine
field exercises by the israeli military were canceled and israel radio offered driving tips to motorists unaccustomed to coping with snowy roads few people were out on the roads anyway nearly all jerusalem shops and businesses were closed along with schools and universities
an announcer on israel's channel 1 gleefully held up a handful of snow to show viewers what the stuff looks like with good reason _ by late afternoon the rare snowfall had all but melted away
a no-confidence vote against prime minister benjamin netanyahu was going on as scheduled at the knesset at the parliament building normally strait-laced security guards clowned and posed with a big snowman on the lawn
a rare holiday mood prevailed in the streets of jerusalem where bomb scares and frustrations over the stalled mideast peace process often lead to a tense and angry atmosphere people picked their way about on foot cameras in hand
orthodox jewish women in their long skirts cavorted decorously in the snow on the mount of olives palestinian youths in their red-and-white keffiyehs _ so often captured in news photographs hurling rocks at soldiers _ tossed snowballs instead
at the israeli checkpoint outside the west bank town of ramallah two straight-faced israeli soldiers stopped arab motorists as usual _ then broke into big grins and lobbed some snowballs
in west bank towns and villages young palestinian men helped stranded motorists shoveled entrances to hospitals and delivered bread
voice of palestine radio broadcast telephone numbers for civil defense officials and hospitals while playing a well-known arabic tune called it's snowing
the little flowers are cold and the sheep are having a hard time a singer warbled as the announcer read the lists of numbers
by midday main roads were cleared and public transportation had resumed only a few scattered power outages were reported and ben gurion airport outside tel aviv remained open
the train from lower-lying coastal tel aviv _ which got freezing sleet and hail instead of snow _ was packed with families who brought their children to jersualem to see the sight
in one closed east jerusalem elementary school a school janitor put snow in the freezer so palestinian students from outside the city could see it when classes resumed the next day
israel's large population of winter-hardened russian immigrants took the snow in stride maxim chernovsky 22 a recent arrival picked up five hitchhikers on his way to work telling them i feel like a taxi driver
some jewish settlements in the west bank were snowed in in the settlement of efrat in the hills south of bethlehem settlers built snowmen and took their children out sledding
almost no one here owns a snowblower or snow shovel so jerusalemites were using rubber mops and squeegees to clear off their front steps and cars because the city doesn't have a snowplow fleet officials used bulldozers and earth movers to clear the roads
elsewhere in the country rain caused problems the palestinian-run gaza strip in the south was hit by flooding in the sprawling khan younis refugee camp more than two dozen families were flooded out of their homes and staying in tents and shelters
in neighboring jordan the storm stranded motorists cut power lines and dumped snow into the normally arid deserts heavy snow closed mountain roads in lebanon and syria
at jerusalem's western wall melting snow dripped down between scraps of paper prayers stuffed into the cracks by religious jews a group of tourists built a snowman in the wall's shadow

un officials are proposing that the world body double the value of iraq's oil sales under the oil-for-food program a un spokesman told dow jones here monday
if the un security council approves the move iraq will be pumping about 16 million barrels per day on to the already saturated oil market by february said dennis halliday the un relief coordinator in iraq
halliday said that un and iraqi experts were reviewing the current program which allows the sale of dlrs 2 billion worth of oil every six months to enable the government to buy food medicine and other humanitarian supplies for its 22 million people
halliday said among the recommendations due to be finalized this week was a proposal for the un security council to take a decision which will increase iraqi revenues by 100 percent or even more
the recommendation was to implement such an increase during the current six-month phase of the program the third since it began in december 1996 halliday said
the boost was needed to rehabilitate iraq's drinking water facilities and upgrade the power grid
halliday said the oil-for-food scheme has done very little to alleviate the suffering of the iraqis under the sweeping un trade sanctions imposed after iraq's 1990 invasion of kuwait
he said he would be forwarding the recommendations to un secretary-general kofi annan who is expected to put them before the security council at the end of january
halliday was optimistic the security council would approve the recommendation
under the current six-month phase iraq plans to pump 800000 barrels per day but with the recommendation this would jump to about 16 million barrels per day
the exact volume of iraqi exports would be determined by prices on the international market lower prices would mean more oil was exported
meantime an iraqi oil official said monday that his government has signed its first contracts under the program's third phase

talk of an asian crisis is misplaced the president of germany's bundesbank said monday
there are some crises but they are addressed now said hans tietmeyer speaking in his capacity as chairman of the influential group of 10 central bankers
we hope that first of all there will be some restoration of confidence in a short time added tietmeyer in remarks to reporters after the group of 10's monthly meeting
he said the central bankers were briefed by their counterpart from south korea bank of korea governor lee kyung-shik on the current economic financial and political situation in his country
lee was ending his six-day european trip to meet with commercial and central bankers to try to drum up support for south korea
we hope that korea is on the way to improvement tietmeyer added noting that there will be further talks in new york next week between the south koreans and commercial banks
last week in new york banks discussed rolling over south korea's short-term debt and developed plans to repackage debt into securities
tietmeyer said the us dollar was being strengthened by the flight to quality from weakened asian currencies but stressed he wasn't making an assessment about the level of the us currency
the united states is faced with a stronger dollar now whether this is not overshooting is another matter he said
he noted that there is a tighter link between asia and the us and japanese economies than with european economies
the direct effect on europe is not the same though on the other hand the us economy is doing very well tietmeyer said
however he warned that increased price competition after the recent devaluation of asian currencies will pose a big challenge for europe
but that competition could be helpful to european economies by damping the risk of inflation added tietmeyer
turning to the japanese economy tietmeyer said he hopes the government's proposed budget tax cuts and reform of the country's financial establishment will bear fruit in 1998
we hope these measures will have some sort of impact as far as the japanese economy and its development throughout the year is concerned he said
the g-10 whose membership has grown to 11 countries includes central bankers from belgium britain canada france germany italy japan the netherlands sweden switzerland and the united states

journalists can praise pattaya's resurrection all they like the nation jan 7 but the undercurrent of violence that permeates the place especially involving the baht bus drivers will always mean that it is far from being a safe place to holiday
after an unprovoked assault - i committed the heinous crime of parking my motorcycle on a stretch of public road that baht bus drivers claim as their own domain - i spoke to a number of long-term pattaya residents and was quite amazed at their own experiences which indicate a big upsurge in violence in recent times
the ugly face of pattaya as exemplified by baht bus drivers has been a problem for years and while the authorities have said many times they will sort out these wretched weasels nothing has changed the baht bus drivers still assault innocent foreigners at will because they know they can get away with it - the local police control the baht buses so they are reluctant to help while the tourist police say it is difficult to find witnesses as assailants their buddies bystanders and others either seem to magically disappear or say they saw nothing
my assault which occurred on dec 28 when i stopped outside a pavement hamburger stand to get a snack came just a few hours after i had checked out the purchase of an apartment in jomtien to use as a weekend retreat but i will have to think of another place for my weekends away from bangkok as my young daughter is often on the motorbike with me and i can never be sure what crime i am going commit in pattaya that will bring such swift and vicious retribution from the weasels

regional perspective/once again chuan faces dilemma over cambodia

as the general election draws closer so are the uncertainties accompanying cambodian politics as an important neighbour on its western flank thailand is facing the same dilemma yet again in forming practical and non-partisan policies towards cambodia
when the government of prime minister chuan leekpai was in power the first time back in 1992-1995 the cambodian situation was very much under global scrutiny and the united nations was in full control of the war-torn country thailand's approach was in large part derived from the overall un plans
even then thailand's close ties with the khmer rouge was a bone of contention for the un transitional authority in cambodia at that time the key issue was the creditability of the thai government now it is the same
after the coalition government was installed in cambodia following the successful election in 1993 thailand joined other countries to recognise the cambodian government run by the dual prime ministers of prince norodom ranariddh and hun sen as the legitimate representatives
however local thai security and defence authorities did not strictly pursue a non-partisan policy thus causing discrepancies in implementing a united approach towards cambodia these differences continue to undermine thailand's policy towards its neighbour
for instance notorious issues relating to illegal logging gem mining and the sale of weapons and ammunition continue unabated to a certain extent these problems remain and the new chuan government cannot turn a blind eye to them or else they will return to haunt the central government in the end as they did in numerous previous thai governments
in the past few months every time fighting broke out between resistance groups and phnom penh troops in the western region close to the thai border thai soldiers were often implicated and accused of assisting one rival group against the other or both
during the previous government under gen chavalit yongchaiyudh it was quite obvious that the thai support was oriented towards the second prime minister hun sen chavalit's ties with hun sen as well as with other key cambodian leaders went back to the heights of the cambodian conflict in the mid-1970s when chavalit was directing clandestine activities in dealing with the cambodian factions these ties have translated into lucrative trade transactions between the current government and chavalit's close associates and supporters
with such long-standing and deep-rooted ties between the cambodian groups and thai authorities along the thai-cambodian border chavalit paid more attention to boosting his personal ties with hun sen although ousted prime minister ranariddh was not sidelined he was not favoured by chavalit
after the last july 5-6 power seizure by hun sen chavalit openly backed hun sen and limited the number of exiled politicians who sought refuge in thailand so as not to jeopardise his close links with hun sen initially most of the key cabinet members who belonged to the funcinpec party decided to stay away from thailand and sought exile in singapore and other countries
the previous government's lack of neutrality was well known and in reality affected thailand's role in cambodia and the broader asean framework it was not surprising why thailand was unable to take initiatives on its own that could translate into asean support as in the past
the birth of the asean troika thailand indonesia and the philippines to solve the cambodian conflict was an attempt to promote the forum's role in resolving the crisis and in handling its sensitive membership issue but it has so far not be able to proceed very far
unbiased role it is crucial now that thailand take an unbiased role and the lead in cambodian affairs as the momentum of returning politicians in exile continues and will culminate with the return of ranariddh to cambodia next week the chuan government needs to establish a serious dialogue with both ranariddh and hun sen and ensure that the planned election now scheduled for july 26 will be free and fair
to break with the previous government's pro-hun sen policy chuan is planning to hold talks with ranariddh - the first for a thai leader since the prince was ousted last july
but this must be done with great caution even though it is thailand's responsibility as part of the asean team to obtain an update on ranariddh and his faction if handled badly this could upset the delicate ties with the phnom penh government it is equally imperative that chuan holds a dialogue with hun sen to ensure the neutrality of the thai government in the upcoming election as prime minister and defence minister such a guarantee is important
thailand has learned a hard lesson that it is important to match words with deeds when chuan declared that thailand had no ties with the khmer rouge during his first administration back in 1994 no one took his words seriously it took months and many allegations later before the local authorities and security officials followed chuan's policy and subsequently won the international community's support
in other words cambodia's leaders must believe the thai leader to play a constructive role in cambodia as well as in the upcoming election thailand must win the confidence of both rival leaders hun sen and ranariddh and chuan it appears has the ability to do so
indeed it is the chuan government's top priority to bring thailand into the overall scheme of things in cambodia and play the role of a neutral facilitator without the confidence of the rival cambodian leaders thailand's role will be diminished and its subsequent voice as a member of the asean troika would be pushed to the back burner this also could erode asean's position and eventually impede wider international cooperation on cambodia
next on the agenda will be an effective way for thailand to assist cambodia in holding a free and fair election there is much that the regional and international community can do if it so desires
thailand along with asean and the friends of cambodia foc is pondering whether to dispatch observers to monitor the election at the moment there has not been any individual or joint commitments from concerned countries given thailand's experience in the electoral process thailand can be if need be the first country to commit to dispatching several hundred observers other asean countries and the foc can follow suit or provide much-needed financial assistance
it is only through a vigorous and neutral policy can the chuan government overcome its current dilemma and re-establish thailand as the prime mover in the settlement of the current cambodian quagmire

rambutan lychee jackfruit mangosteen durian - thailand has a wealth of colourful exotic fruits and yet for most of us it is the humble banana that holds pride of place in our hearts minds - and tummies
thailand has traditionally been known as the land of smiles but it could also accurately been called the land of fruits
most foreign visitors are overwhelmed by and justifiably jealous of the extensive range of fruit that thailand's fertile orchards produce - the mighty mango the luscious lychee the spiky rambuttan and of course the king of them all the durian
but ask any thai which fruit they feel is representative of their country and chances are they'll say the banana
whoever would have thought that the humble banana would win out over say the mango yet the reason is surprisingly simple thai children are usually introduced to these tropical treats as toddlers for many it is the first solid food they taste
our great-great-great-grandmothers believed that the kluay nam-la-wa just one of the many species of bananas indigenous to thailand was beneficial to the excretory system they passed down the information to their daughters who dutifully added the banana to the diets of their own infants as soon as they reached the three-month-old markerpunnee soontornjamorn 56 is one of many grandmothers who is carrying on the tradition the mother of five started her children's offspring on the regime exactly three months after their birth mushing up bananas adding a touch of salt and then feeding the gurgling infants with a spoonful of banana followed by a spoonful of boiled water
bananas are very nutritious and babies like the taste she says i've never bought any of those expensive supplementary foods that you find in supermarkets
bananas are best she says firmly
and they're cheap too - an added attraction in these days of belt-tightening
punnee's grandchildren don't just enjoy eating bananas they are also tuned in to the many fun activities that a banana tree provides when punnee hears their laughter at the antics of actors dressed as bananas on the popular children's tv programme kluay hom jom son bananas in pyjamas her thoughts stray back to the happy days of her childhood when she played with her friends in the banana orchards near her home
we loved maa kaan kluay it was the best game of all we stripped most of the leaves off a banana frond leaving enough on the stalk at the ends so that they looked like feathers she recalls with a fond smile then we would chase each other on our banana horses it was a simple game but so much fun sinith sitthiraksa 41 a canadian-trained environmentalist has equally fond memories of banana tree toys
when i was young my mother made many different kinds of toys from the banana tree for me she says as kids we played with toy guns and knives fashioned out of banana leaves my favourite was the maa kaan kluay sinith is convinced that her interest in the environment stems from those carefree days of childhood she may have earned her ma from the faculty of environmental studies at canada's york university but her ecological education began when she was a toddler
my mother was my first environmental teacher she never bought aluminum foil or plastic wrap but used banana leaves for wrapping food she got the string from dried pieces of the trunk the banana is much more than an infant formula and a material for making toys it's also an important ingredient in many traditional remedies and is regarded as a symbol of fertility
during traditional upcountry weddings the bride and bridegroom plant a banana sapling in front of the bride's house to ensure that she bears healthy children
the trunk of the versatile tree is also used as the base for bai-tong krathong banana leaf vessels which are used in such merit-making rites as bai sri soo kwan a ceremonial welcoming and during loy krathong the annual full-moon festival when people float krathong decorated with flowers and candles to apologise to the goddess of water for abusing her rivers and canals
traditional savoury snacks and desserts are still wrapped in bai-tong and environmental groups are actively encouraging people to forgo the ubiquitous plastic bag in favour of the eco-friendly banana leaf
sinith considers herself fortunate to have enough space in the garden of bangkok residence to raise her own fruit trees
i just step into the backyard and i can pick any kind of fruit i like - papaya mango jack fruit guava sugar apple rose apple or banana she wrote recently in the thai development support committee tdsc newsletterbut it is the banana that is closest to sinith's heart my mother passed away three years ago at the age of 78 she says whenever i look out at my garden i remember the plump and healthy banana trees that were so much part of my childhood to me it is the tree of life bananas in medicine roots and underground stems help heal minor burns china

the head of the european union urged japan monday to stimulate its domestic economy as a way of helping alleviate asia's economic and financial crisis
japan needs to boost its domestic demand so that the country can increase imports from asia europe and the world said jacque santer in tokyo for the seventh japan-european union summit
santer president of the 20-member european commission the eu's executive body also stressed that japan should take steps to stabilize its shaky financial system and keep deregulating its economy
japanese prime minister ryutaro hashimoto responded by assuring summit participants that japanese leaders were working hard to fix the weak economy and that japan would not start a global recession kyodo news agency reported
earlier monday hashimoto outlined to parliament among other measures a plan to shore up confidence in banks by creating a 30 trillion yen dlrs 231 billion financial safety net
santer praised the japanese government's measures as a step in the right direction for both its sluggish economy and the rest of asia but he also encouraged japan to take a greater leadership role
japan should take a more eminent role in politics not only in asia but in the world said santer
at their summit meeting monday the european union and japan agreed on the need for asian countries to quickly and fully implement reforms to put their economies back on track
the meeting was attended by santer hashimoto and british prime minister tony blair britain currently holds the rotating presidency of the eu
summit participants said in a press statement that asia's long-term economic prospects were basically sound but that the countries needed appropriate macroeconomic management financial sector restructuring and improved financial supervision trade liberalization deregulation and other structural measures apdj-kgo-tz
it has the ingredients for a nasty brawl as flamboyant entrepreneur richard branson and the world's top lottery boss guy snowden head into a libel trial based on sensational bribery charges
branson the briton who runs everything from airlines to music stores says snowden chairman of us lottery operator gtech corp tried to pay him off to stay out of the race to run the british numbers game
snowden denies trying to bribe branson though a spokesman has previously said the lottery chieftain doesn't remember exactly what was said during a lunch at branson's london office on sept 24 1993
the two sides were meeting privately with the judge sir michael morland at london's high court on monday with opening arguments to a jury tentatively scheduled for tuesday
it was unclear whether any type of late settlement could stop the trial both sides were staying mum _ as british law requires when court cases get under way
the dispute began nearly five years ago when branson and snowden were among the numerous business people seeking to run britain's national lottery
the license to run the numbers game was eventually won by a for-profit consortium known as camelot which includes gtech and the lottery began operating in 1994
branson had sought to run the lottery on a non-profit basis and claims snowden tried to bribe him to stay out
according to branson's account of the luncheon the gtech chairman said at one point i don't know how to phrase this richard there is always a bottom line i'll get to the point _ how can we help you
branson says he was so taken aback that he retreated to the men's room and wrote down snowden's words
snowden has labeled branson's charges grossly defamatory and totally untrue
once branson was accused of lying about the encounter he filed the libel suit against snowden gtech and robert rendine a gtech spokesman
snowden countersued branson saying he was seeking to restore my good name the two cases have been combined with both sides seeking unspecified damages
when the lawsuits were filed it emerged that also present at the lunch was john jackson chief executive of the british dry-cleaning and film processing company sketchley plc and a friend of branson's who has backed up branson's story
britain's lottery regulators ordered an independent investigation of the affair which found no evidence that snowden tried to bribe branson
but that was the sole possible outcome as only snowden would cooperate with the probe branson said he would rather fight the battle in court
the investigator veteran criminal lawyer anne rafferty raised several questions about branson's claims namely whether snowden's comments inevitably suggest an attempt to bribe and why snowden would make such an attempt when branson had a witness present and snowden was unaccompanied
branson was 15th graf pvs
german clubs went on a shopping spree monday the last day of transfers before the bundesliga resumes on jan 30
bayer leverkusen one of the title contenders announced the signing of norwegian defensive midfielder bent-andre skammelsrud from rosenborg trondheim
skammelsrud 23 received a contract until june 30 2000 the transfer fee was 500000 marks dlrs 280000 said leverkusen which has qualified for the quarterfinals of the champions cup
stuttgart the german cup winner and also a league title contender signed macedonian international mirko stojkovski from spanish first-division team real oviedo
stojkovski 26 signed a contract valid until june 30 2001 no details of the transfer were given
arminia bielefeld signed bulgarian international adalbert zafirov captain of zska sofia the 28-year-old defender cost bielefeld about 15 million marks dlrs 800000 german media said
bayern munich second in the standings loaned reserves markus muench and dennis grassow to fc cologne which is fighting to avoid relegation
other clubs also acquired new players in the last few days before monday's deadline
frontrunner kaiserslautern got two hungarians lajos szuecs and janos hrutka
karlsruhe got german veteran guido buchwald who returned from japan and frenchman david zitelli from racing strasbourg
msv duisburg was set to sign stig toefting from the danish club odense and moldavian international alexander popovic
the report by the agency came after ritter and a team of un inspectors made a visit monday to iraqi government buildings near the headquarters of the un special commission which is responsible for the weapons inspection program
apparently the team was not blocked since the agency's report said the ban on ritter would begin jan 13 tuesday
it quoted the government spokesman as saying ritter's team included too many americans and britons adding the team will not be allowed to carry out inspections unless it is recomposed in a balanced manner
the official said the team included nine americans five britons a russian and an australian
this shows striking evidence of the imbalance in the composition of the team and its methods of action in iraq the spokesman said more
the greek stock market plummeted more than 5 percent monday in reaction to losses in asia and weaker european markets
it was the latest blow to greece's financial sector following heavy pressure last week on the drachma by currency traders the government raised interest rates in an attempt to keep the drachma from losing value against major currencies
the athens stock exchange's general index closed at 140537 down 51 percent from friday's close traders said foreign investors switching to safer markets triggered the selling spree
greece is more sensitive to declines in other markets because of the ongoing pressure on the drachma said evricos sarsentis an analyst at telesis securities
analysts predicted more losses were possible on the greek exchange because of volatility on wall street

kuala lumpur sun - the chances of death from pelvic injuries have been reduced thanks to a medical device developed in malaysia
the device known as the nina pelvic immobiliser is used once an unstable pelvic fracture is diagnosed to reduce the risk of complications
its inventor hospital kuala lumpur consultant traumatologist and head of emergency department dr abu hassan asaari abdullah said pelvic injury was a common cause of trauma deaths
pelvic injuries represent at least five per cent of all fractures and account for the third most commonly encountered in motor vehicle accident fatalities he said
pelvic fractures or injuries caused by violent impact may result in blood loss as high as four litres in closed fractures and more than that in open fractures
this is because the pelvis has vessels passing through and it surrounds a large potential space in which a considerable volume of blood can accumulate undetected
an average human has five to seven litres of blood in the body
the pelvic girdle is a set of bones that allows movement of the legs in relation to the rest of the body and provides sites for the attachment of the relevant muscles
the pelvic immobiliser is easy to apply requires no general anaesthesia and can be applied by specialists medical officers medical assistants nurses and paramedics dr abu hassan said
it is used when the patient has to wait for surgery or is being moved to a site far away
the immobiliser will relieve pain and reduce potential complications
dr abu hassan said
its main fixing components are a horizontal bar made of stainless steel with chromium two vertical bars made of aluminium plate coated with chromium two clamp plates made of stainless steel padded with pvc leather and two screw bars with winding handle made of stainless steel
there is a specific method to assemble and apply the nina pelvic immobiliser
the fracture is reduced by pushing the iliac bone inwards towards each other using bilateral compressive force
the immobiliser must be put in a position to stabilise the fractures by holding the pelvis together without slipping down posteriorly
the immobiliser should not be used for more than six hours after which there is potential risk of pressure necrosis death or decay of tissue
pelvic injuries could also lead to injuries such as visceral rupture in the rectum urogenital system injuries nerve injury retroperitoneal haemorrhage and reproductive system injuries
other serious complications that can cause death are disseminated intravascular coagulation fat embolism syndrome and adult respiratory distress syndrome
the pelvic immobiliser was first used on 20 patients who showed good results and to date 50 patients had benefited
dr abu hassan said the idea had not been exported and patenting it which was expensive was in the process currently it is used in some malaysian hospitals
he had presented the immobiliser for peer group review among local and foreign orthopaedic surgeons in the government and private sectors and universities
it was also presented to the institute for medical research and the asean orthopaedic association last month

the derivatives liquidity ratio which represents the ratio between turnover value of futures against turnover value of component stocks has increased steadily and in november 1997 stood at 051 duggan says
in kloffe's effort in educating the public of its services duggan says its continued retail education programme is paying off as domestic retail participation in kloffe has increased to current levels of around 40 per cent
contrary to some views he adds foreign institutions continue to support the malaysian equity derivatives market and account for more than 85 per cent of kloffe's open interest
duggan says the current upheaval in both the equity and currency markets will provide many challenges to kloffe and its members as they strive to further educate market participants on the many advantages offered by using kloffe products
meanwhile duggan says kloffe is currently working closely with the regulatory bodies in an endeavour to launch its equity index option product as soon as possible currently kloffe has only one product
human rights groups criticized the german government monday for its efforts to seal germany from kurds who arrived on italy's southern shores in recent weeks
germany has stepped up border controls and urged italy turkey and greece to do the same interior minister manfred kanther has portrayed the kurds numbering in the hundreds not as refugees but as potential illegal immigrants taking advantage of european open borders
heiko kaufmann spokesman for the pro asyl refugee rights group said kanther was using the kurds _ and their alleged threat to german borders _ as an election-year theme that risks inflaming anti-foreigner sentiment
whoever lowers the flight of people to the level of a crime is losing all proportion he told a news conference this is verbal arson
some religious leaders agreed
german asylum policy is aimed at total isolation charged joern erik gutheil an evangelical church official
the number of asylum seekers arriving in germany has declined steadily since the nation's liberal asylum law was tightened in 1993 last year asylum applications declined to about 100000 from 117000 in 1996 kanther said monday he did not give a breakdown by nationality
some members of kanther's party chancellor helmut kohl's ruling christian democrats warned against hysteria over the kurdish asylum-seekers
we have seen that only four kurds have come to germany in recent days lawmaker armin laschet was quoted as saying in the cologne daily express and we can send these back to italy without problem
munich police said monday they nabbed seven kurdish illegal immigrants friday in a minibus driven by two hungarians the kurds who said they were brought to germany from istanbul turkey by truck were released after applying for asylum police said tc-aet

kuala lumpur sun - the co-operatives development department will provide interest-free loans of between rm30000 and rm15 million to co-operatives wishing to venture into agriculture
its administrative officer finance loans section ismail mohamad sohor said co-operatives which owned land should be encouraged to develop oil palm plantations or farms
besides providing soft loans and easy payment schemes co-operatives should also venture into agriculture to help members offset the high prices for imported vegetables
those intending to undertake certain projects on their plots but face financial constraints can apply for this facility
however they must prove to us that the project is low risk and viable he said
ismail said if a co-operative needed additional capital for its project the department could provide an immediate non-collateral loan of up to rm30000
but if the project has yet to take off and the request is about rm15 million the department may ask the co-operative to put down its land as collateral
he said co-operatives were also allowed to go into joint ventures with private companies in property development consumerables and other commercial ventures only if such activities could increase their members' annual dividends
every week we receive at least one request from co-operatives for loans to enable them to carry out agricultural projects
most of these applications are from co-operatives owned by land settlers farmers and villagers and which do not have much capital to begin their projects
the department will provide an immediate disbursement of rm30000 to the co-operative if its project is deemed viable he added
meanwhile some co-operatives are bracing themselves for an increase in members' applications for soft loans and other easy payment schemes once the effects of the country's economic problem trickle down to the people
although co-operatives cannot compete with financial institutions in providing large amounts of loans and overdrafts co-operatives can provide soft loans without collateral to their members to bind them over a troubled period
in this respect many co-operatives expect the number of loan applications to rise two or three-folds from march onwards after the festive celebrations have ended
the report by the agency came after american scott ritter and a team of un inspectors made a visit monday to iraqi government buildings near the headquarters of the un special commission which is responsible for the weapons inspection program
apparently the team was not blocked since the agency's report said the ban on ritter would begin jan 13 tuesday
it quoted the government spokesman as saying ritter's team included too many americans and britons adding the team will not be allowed to carry out inspections unless it is recomposed in a balanced manner
the official said the team included nine americans five britons a russian and an australian
this shows striking evidence of the imbalance in the composition of the team and its methods of action in iraq the spokesman said more

hong kong people view the fire services as the best government department and the housing department as the worst a survey has revealed
among public bodies the independent commission against corruption the mass transit railway corp and the consumer council were the most popular the housing authority was the most unpopular
the findings were by city university's department of applied social studies which interviewed 1000 people last month on the popularity of 28 government departments and 11 statutory bodies
results of the survey included 17 per cent of respondents saying that the fire services department's performance was most satisfactory followed by radio television hong kong 157 per cent and the post office 11 per cent
senior lecturer dr john tse wing-ling said the degree of contact provision of service and propaganda work were the reasons behind the choices
dr tse said the fire services should should not be satisfied by the perception it was chosen as the best government department because of the positive image presented to the public he said
pictures like a fireman holding a rescued baby and exhausted firemen at the scene of a fire created a positive impression he pointed out
still tens of people die every year in fires dr tse said so the department should do more on fire prevention
the housing department was rated the worst department by 264 people also unpopular were the education and labour departments
more than 30 per cent of respondents believed the housing authority to be the worst statutory body though 24 per cent said the hospital authority was the worst
these organisations' frequent contact with the public had exposed their inefficiency he said
mounting evidence that ruling party politicians in spain's basque country are the new no 1 target of the armed separatist group eta has sent a chill through party ranks with calls emerging for more police to be deployed in the troubled region
on monday four days after popular party fellow councilor jose ignacio iruretagoyena was killed in a bomb attack in the town of zarauz graffiti in the toilets of a town bar warned iruretagoyena's party colleague jorge knopf the next one will be you
although knopf told reporters he would not cow to the terrorists neither he nor any of his fellow councilors were available for comment on the threat or their plans to evade the gunmen
you have to understand that they ruling party councilors are reluctant to talk they are under a lot of pressure said popular party spokesman in the region javier saenz
worrying about unsigned scribbled threats might seem like an overreaction but in the northern basque region where three ruling party councilors have been killed in six months a few words on a wall hold a special significance
days after eta killed young popular party councilor miguel angel blanco last july graffiti appeared warning colleague jose luis caso he was next
caso was shot dead by an eta gunman in a bar on december 11
the slayings have sparked a discussion over the basque regional police's ability to provide protection
how many more dead councilors can the popular party take the political weekly cambio 16 wrote
but while prime minister jose maria aznar himself a target of an eta car bomb has expressed confidence in the basque police several politicians including popular party founder manuel fraga have called on the government to send in reinforcements
the latest graffiti warning came on the day when the ajuria enea a pact by all basque political parties to work together to bring peace to the region commemorated its 10th anniversary monday
in the past politicians tended to be secondary targets for eta with security force members topping the list of the near 800 people it has killed since beginning its independence campaign in 1968
but the crack down on eta that accompanied the new popular party government which took office 1996 appears to have encouraged the separatists' to make killing ruling party politicians a priority
according to the spanish daily el mundo there are already four private security firms watching over party members in the basque region apart from normal police protection
in early december a bodyguard assigned to councilor elena azpiroz was shot in the head when he went to check out two men acting suspiciously outside the politician's home
we're faced with beasts in the form of humans who don't like the interior ministry's policies and are trying to kill us popular party councilor maria eugenia garcia who has two bodyguards told the daily el mundo
the interior ministry refused to detail what new measures may be taken but admitted it has been working on a protection plan for basque politicians for some time including self-defense classes and videos to help potential victims identify their potential attackers

to wait or not - common dilemma among investors

it would be such a good feeling if the price of a counter which an investor has bought suddenly moves up strongly after he has bought it
if he still has some cash reserve is it wise for him to buy more of the same counter capitalise on his good fortune and make even more money in future
it has often been said that an investor should buy even more shares of a counter with a rising share price because there is a good chance of it rising even further
the problem with many investors is that they tend to sell too quickly when they see the share price of their counter moving up rather than waiting for a longer period and thus make even more money
better still the investor who is on a winning streak should commit more of his money on the same counter and wait longer to reap a windfall profit
in principle this sounds simple and logical that one wonders why many investors in the stock market do not make as much money as they should if they were following this principle
they are not making their fortunes because in practice this is more easily said than done
to begin with not all stocks keep rising after the investor has made money on his initial purchase for the price can suddenly stop rising after buying additional shares
so instead of making money on both his initial purchase and the additional shares he could be faced with the problem of making less money on the initial purchase if the price falls and losing money on the additional shares
the net effect could be that he ends up with only a little profit or worse still he loses money when he has added up his sums on both the initial and additional purchases
he could of course wait longer to see if the share price resumes rising after pulling back but what if the price keeps falling even further if he waits thus compounding his losses
in the market nothing is certain and our expectations of how the counter is likely to move in a day a week or a month can turn out to be different from what actually happens
the difficult decision the investor has to make is whether to take his profit quickly and forget about his expectations of bigger profits in future or go for bigger profits in future which may or may not turn out to be true
the most wonderful thing will be that when he has bought the additional shares the share price rises even faster and thus he ends up with even more profits on his initial purchase and increasing profits on his additional purchases of shares
however when he makes the decision to buy more shares he is really unsure whether the price is about to rise or fall although he is hopeful that the price will rise rather than fall
city workers used bulldozers as makeshift snowplows and children built yarmulke-clad snowmen as the first big snowfall in six years blanketed this ancient city on monday
more than a foot 50 cm of snow fell overnight in jerusalem and parts of the west bank drifting atop the yellow stone walls of the old city covering the slopes of the biblical mount of olives and coating the golden dome of the rock islam's third-holiest shrine
field exercises by the israeli military were canceled and israel radio offered driving tips to motorists unaccustomed to coping with snowy roads few people were out on the roads anyway nearly all jerusalem shops and businesses were closed along with schools and universities
an announcer on israel's channel 1 gleefully held up a handful of snow to show viewers what the stuff looks like with good reason _ by late afternoon the rare snowfall had all but melted away
a no-confidence vote against prime minister benjamin netanyahu was going on as scheduled at the knesset at the parliament building normally straight-laced security guards clowned and posed with a big snowman on the lawn
a rare holiday mood prevailed in the streets of jerusalem where bomb scares and frustrations over the stalled mideast peace process often lead to a tense and angry atmosphere people picked their way about on foot cameras in hand
orthodox jewish women in their long skirts cavorted decorously in the snow on the mount of olives palestinian youths in their red-and-white keffiyehs _ so often captured in news photographs hurling rocks at soldiers _ tossed snowballs instead
at the israeli checkpoint outside the west bank town of ramallah two straight-faced israeli soldiers stopped arab motorists as usual _ then broke into big grins and lobbed some snowballs
in west bank towns and villages young palestinian men helped stranded motorists shoveled entrances to hospitals and delivered bread
voice of palestine radio broadcast telephone numbers for civil defense officials and hospitals while playing a well-known arabic tune called it's snowing
the little flowers are cold and the sheep are having a hard time a singer warbled as the announcer read the lists of numbers
by midday main roads were cleared and public transportation had resumed only a few scattered power outages were reported and ben gurion airport outside tel aviv remained open
the train from lower-lying coastal tel aviv _ which got freezing sleet and hail instead of snow _ was packed with families who brought their children to jersualem to see the sight
in one closed east jerusalem elementary school a school janitor put snow in the freezer so palestinian students from outside the city could see it when classes resumed the next day
israel's large population of winter-hardened russian immigrants took the snow in stride maxim chernovsky 22 a recent arrival picked up five hitchhikers on his way to work telling them i feel like a taxi driver
some jewish settlements in the west bank were snowed in in the settlement of efrat in the hills south of bethlehem settlers built snowmen and took their children out sledding
almost no one here owns a snowblower or snow shovel so jerusalemites were using rubber mops and squeegees to clear off their front steps and cars because the city doesn't have a snowplow fleet officials used bulldozers and earth movers to clear the roads
elsewhere in the country rain caused problems the palestinian-run gaza strip in the south was hit by flooding in the sprawling khan younis refugee camp more than two dozen families were flooded out of their homes and staying in tents and shelters
in neighboring jordan the storm stranded motorists cut power lines and dumped snow into the normally arid deserts heavy snow closed mountain roads in lebanon and syria
at jerusalem's western wall melting snow dripped down between scraps of paper prayers stuffed into the cracks by religious jews a group of tourists built a snowman in the wall's shadow
in the bible in the psalms when david says white as snow' i always wondered how he knew what snow was like said john vest visiting from florida now i know

united malayan land bhd um land is confident of maintaining its position as a leading township developer in malaysia after taking into account its strengths
in his latest annual statement chairman tunku tan sri shahriman tunku sulaiman says the company's strengths include landbanks in strategic locations low land costs strong corporate shareholders and quality development
he adds that the company will continually review its product mix to ensure the products can be marketed quickly and successfully
tunku shahriman says um land will constantly monitor the property market's conditions amid a changing economic situation and respond appropriately in view of the prevailing conditions in the property market the company foresees a more challenging business environment ahead he adds
um land recorded a higher group pre-tax profit of rm8824 million for the year ended july 31 1997 compared with rm7217 million in 1996
turnover increased to rm18215 million from rm16804 million previously
profit after tax rose to rm7495 million from rm5334 million in the year before earnings per share jumped to 34 sen from 24 sen previously
tunku shahriman attributes the improved profits mainly to the continued good demand for properties being developed in bandar seri alam by its wholly-owned subsidiary seri alam properties sdn bhd
according to him um land will continue to position itself in specialised niche developments and in this respect will source for suitable choice land
towards this end he says the company has proposed the acquisition of a 263ha site in kota kinabalu for the proposed development of a business park
in addition he says um land will continue to identify other high potential developments in the growth corridors of the country
directors are proposing a final dividend of 75 per cent less tax for the year just ended
continuing political tension could plunge zanzibar into civil conflict a commonwealth official said monday the 34th anniversary of the clove-growing island's revolution
secretary-general emeka anyaoku urged president salmin amour and leaders of the civic united front to accept his package of proposals aimed at defusing tensions between them
i have appealed to both sides not to lose their opportunity of arresting the current political drift in zanzibar and embarking on a course that i believe will serve the interests of all zanzibaris anyaoku said
there was no immediate reaction to his proposal from either side
in january 1964 leftists defeated rule by the omani sultan and established a republic in zanzibar the revolution marked the overthrow of the island's long-established arab-ruling class by africans who were the majority of the population
at an anniversary ceremony amour blamed foreigners for the political strife now plaguing zanzibar
the problems on zanzibar will not be solved by outsiders but only by zanzibaris amour said alleging unspecified foreigners were planning to plunge the island into chaos
police are investigating an alleged plot to topple amour's government which the cuf has refused to recognize since the 1995 elections
fifteen cuf officials including two members of zanzibar's parliament have been charged with treason for their alleged role in the overthrow plot first announced in december
last week police raided the headquarters of an opposition party and seized files after a three-hour search
in 1995 amour was reelected with 502 percent of the vote to 498 percent for the cuf's seif sharrif hamad who campaigned for increased zanzibari automony from tanzania
local and international observers said the elections were flawed several countries have withdrawn their aid to zanzibar because of the irregularities and subsequent harassment of cuf members
the cuf has effectively boycotted the proceedings of the zanzibar house of representatives where it holds 24 of 50 elective seats
anyaoku proposed an immediate cessation of confrontational statements between amour and cuf that all political parties be allowed to freely pursue their activities peacefully within the law that both sides ensure the house functions properly with full participation of all elected representatives that all former public office holders receive uniform treatment and that within six months the president appoint five more cuf members to the house
the anniversary ceremonies attended by benjamin mkapa president of the tanzanian republic were subdued in deference to muslims marking ramadan a month of fasting that ends in mid-february also islanders are coping with a cholera outbreak that already has killed more than 140 people
zanzibar's links to the arab gulf stretch back to the ninth century in recent years it has looked increasingly to oman for financial and development aid which has not been forthcoming from the tanzanian mainland
zanzibar has its own parliament and sends representatives to the federal parliament in the central mainland tanzania's town of dodoma
fifteen former policemen and two government agents have been ordered to appear before the truth and reconciliation commission in connection with alleged human rights abuses by winnie madikizela-mandela
president nelson mandela's ex-wife who underwent a 10-day public hearing before the commission late last year will not testify but can attend with her lawyers and ask questions of witnesses according to a truth commission statement monday
madikizela-mandela has been accused of ordering murders and torture by her gang of thugs in the soweto black township in the late 1980s the gang called the mandela united football club conducted a reign of terror in the township that caused anti-apartheid groups to condemn it and disassociate themselves with madikizela-mandela
at the end of the previous hearing madikizela-mandela denied any role in the killings beatings and other abuses by football club members calling her accusers lunatics and liars
the three-day hearing beginning jan 28 will question the former policemen and two government intelligence agents on an apartheid government smear campaign against madikizela-mandela whether she was spied on and their investigations of murders and other crimes in which she allegedly was involved
one of the former policemen subpoenaed by the commission was eugene de kock the former head of the notorious vlakplaas death squad who now is serving a life prison term for his conviction on multiple charges of murder
the truth commission set up in late 1995 is investigating apartheid-era human rights abuses and will write a report this year aimed at detailing the atrocities to promote reconciliation
it also can grant amnesty to people making full confessions of political crimes madikizela-mandela never applied for amnesty from the panel before its deadline last year and could face criminal charges based on evidence uncovered by the commission
an iraqi official said government buildings visited by ritter's team monday included a hospital and prison in baghdad
in new york ewen buchanan a spokesman for the un inspection teams said the united nations had not been informed officially of the iraqi decision to block inspections led by ritter
we're trying to find out what this means buchanan said
ritter was severely criticized by iraq at the time that it blocked american weapons inspectors from working in iraq last october which led to a three-week break in the weapons inspections
iraq had accused the americans of spying on iraq and helping plan for us attacks on the country un officials denied the charges and pulled all weapons inspectors out of the country the impasse was ended with russian mediation
the inspectors' job is to certify that iraq has fulfilled its obligation under un resolutions to eliminate its weapons of mass destruction
sanctions imposed on iraq following its 1990 invasion of iraq _ which include a ban on the export of oil _ cannot be lifted until the un security council accepts iraqi weapons programs have been halted
iraq maintains it has fulfilled the requirements under security council resolutions but the weapons inspectors have repeatedly accused the government of president saddam hussein of hiding weapons and the means to manufacture them lb-ggl

kuala lumpur sun - the malaysian trades union congress today urged financial institutions to provide low-interest and flexible loans to farmers
its president zainal rampak said credit unions and co-operative societies should also provide similar facilities to those who wanted to grow rice vegetables fruits and rear poultry and dairy cattle
this was to ensure food production could be increased and to reduce the dependence on imports in order to conserve foreign exchange
while mtuc appreciates the government's efforts to make the country an industrialised nation by placing emphasis on manufacturing and high-technology it must be reminded that almost all industrialised countries in the west are major food producers
he said these countries not only had sophisticated technology but also had balanced their industrial growth with high agricultural productivity to meet the needs of their populations
zainal said it was sad that malaysia which was self-sufficient in rice production about 10 years ago was now compelled to import from thailand and pakistan as domestic production was enough to meet only about 40 per cent of needs
if only adequate attention had been accorded to the green book plan introduced by the late tun abdul razak in the 1970s he said the country would have continued to be self-sufficient in food and would not have needed to import food
zainal said the country would perhaps have been able even to export surplus food and earn foreign exchange
he added that given the present circumstances self-sufficiency in food would have enabled the country to prevent the outflow of millions of ringgit in foreign exchange

as proposed the mandatory provident fund would be exposed to unduly high risks _ such as the current financial turmoil in asia _ a pressure group warns
hong kong social security society vice-chairman henry mok tai-kee issued the warning after conducting extensive studies of provident schemes in chile and australia
mr mok said the mpf as proposed in pending legislation would entail a much higher risk investment by fund managers
moreover he warned officials were downplaying the effects of the economic crisis in the region by estimating a 7 per cent loss in returns on investment
our research has shown a 30 to 50 per cent loss in capital by the 10 wealthiest tycoons in hong kong last year mr mok said
he said that while australia and chile permitted no more than 30 per cent of their funds to be invested in stocks the mpf would allow up to 100 per cent of the fund in the stock market
he said very few people use that kind of high-risk investment tactic
although investment returns from stocks could be high in the short run the overall rate of return was lower than inflation he said
the return earned since 1988 after the major stock market crash in 1987 has been outweighed by the 30 to 40 per cent loss incurred by the recent plunge in the stock market mr mok said after deducting the mpf administration fees the actual return rate was 36 to 6 per cent far below the annual 88 per cent inflation rate within the same period
he suggests the government should instruct fund managers to invest according to the land fund investment framework which places 40 per cent in stocks 30 per cent in bonds and 30 per cent in savings
society chairman fernando cheung chiu-hung warned that to allow a maximum of 70 per cent of the mpf to be invested in foreign currencies _ compared with chile's 5 per cent _ was ill-considered
investments elsewhere such as in hi-tech industry as suggested by chief executive tung chee-hwa can increase the wealth of other countries but not hong kong mr cheung said
he said such investments would not help local industries and could create unemployment
the society urged that employees should have a bigger say in choosing fund managers
mr mok cited the mainland's retirement scheme which includes an old-age pension plan and centralised provident fund as the best model
china's reformed retirement fund scheme has recently been praised by the world bank mr mok said
he criticised government officials and politicians for not thoroughly studying other countries' laws before rushing ahead with the mpf
while the mandatory provident fund office says the mpf was drafted after studying chile's provident fund law we doubt if they really looked at the details mr mok said
the society will meet the interim council's bills committee on monday
in a survey by the democratic party 74 per cent of 350 respondents said there should be a comprehensive retirement fund
they agreed those aged 60 or over should be paid pensions of $3000 a month a third believed employees employers and government should all pitch in to cover the payments
swiss firm lindt and spruengli announced monday it is acquiring ghirardelli chocolate co of san francisco
terms for the deal which will see lindt take second place in the us premium chocolate market behind see's candies weren't disclosed
the acquisition adds around dlrs 100 million to lindt's global sales which in 1997 rose 51 percent on the previous year to 102 billion swiss francs dlrs 705 million
ghirardelli founded in 1852 has some 500 employees it has retail outlets in san francisco chicago las vegas and florida's disney world dj-gm

it chose five winners this year to mark the 50th anniversary of the universal declaration of human rights said foundation chairman bill minco the group praised the winners for their long-fought battles to improve human rights in their countries
past medal winners include chinese human rights activist harry wu czech president vaclav havel and the amsterdam-based anne frank foundation

epileptics are being cautioned to take extra care on public transport after a year in which a sufferer was crippled for life and another narrowly escaped death after having seizures and falling in front of mtr trains
welfare groups are warning the sar's estimated 30000 epileptics to be more vigilant
social worker eva lau yin-kwan from the hong kong society for rehabilitation said the hong kong epilepsy association was working closely with the mass transit railway corporation
there are many facilities in the stations in case of emergencies but we still want to warn epilepsy sufferers not to stand too close to the yellow lines and not to face the track ms lau said
she added that an epileptic woman in her 30s was left crippled and had one of her legs amputated when she fell in front of an oncoming train passengers managed to pull her to safety in time but her leg was badly mangled in the accident
and a man in his 20s escaped serious injury after having a seizure and falling on to the track at wan chai station
a spokesman for the mtrc said they frequently reminded passengers of the importance of standing behind the yellow line through public announcements
we also have a white line to make people realise where the edge of the platform is and to alert them to this meanwhile ms lau said many epileptics in hong kong had suffered similar experiences to those in japan when hundreds of people including children suffered epileptic-type convulsions while watching a vividly-illustrated cartoon television show
it left nearly 600 children and adults needing hospital treatment she said
hong kong epileptics she added claim to have had similar symptoms when watching certain tv shows
an iraqi official said government buildings visited by ritter's team monday included a hospital and prison in baghdad
in new york ewen buchanan a spokesman for the un inspection teams said the united nations had not been informed officially of the iraqi decision to block inspections led by ritter
we're trying to find out what this means buchanan said
ritter was severely criticized by iraq at the time that it blocked american weapons inspectors from working in iraq in october which led to a three-week break in the weapons inspections
iraq had accused the americans of spying on iraq and helping plan for us attacks on the country un officials denied the charges and pulled all weapons inspectors out of the country the impasse was ended with russian mediation
the inspectors' job is to certify that iraq has fulfilled its obligation under un resolutions to eliminate its weapons of mass destruction
sanctions imposed on iraq following its 1990 invasion of the neighboring emirate of kuwait _ which include a ban on the export of oil _ cannot be lifted until the un security council accepts iraqi weapons programs have been halted
iraq maintains it has fulfilled the requirements under security council resolutions but the weapons inspectors have repeatedly accused the government of president saddam hussein of hiding weapons and the means to manufacture them
the belgian soccer federation complained monday that fifa has offered it far too few tickets for its world cup games while scalpers are calling in with offers of thousands of seats at hugely inflated prices
it's almost hopeless there is just no way to give the ordinary fan a ticket said jan peeters secretary general of the belgian federation
our best fans will miss it all
belgium was offered just 5400 seats at the 80000-capacity stade de france in saint-denis for its opening game against the netherlands on june 13
the federation has already had 120000 requests for seats from belgian fans eager to see the game against traditional rivals in a stadium just 85 minutes away from brussels by train
peeters already called fifa on friday to complain and was writing an official letter monday he also plans a joint protest with the netherlands who also were offered a limited amount of tickets
belgium is expected to get some 3000 tickets for its second first-round game against mexico in bordeaux on june 20 and 4000 for its last group game against south korea on june 25 in paris
at the same time scalpers are already calling federation headquarters offering thousands of tickets at over six times the official rate peeters said tickets were offered at 9400 francs dlrs 250 while the official rate was 1500 francs dlrs 40
it's proof the ticket system doesn't work this is wrong peeters said
most tickets for the 64 games have already been allocated and the chase for the remaining seats is hot the host nation is getting some two thirds of ticket sales and peeters feared many of those ended up on the parallel black market
this can have a lot of repercussions on security in the stadiums he said seats allocated to different federations are segregated but ticket sales on the black market could create a volatile mix of fans in the stands rac-pa
a german terror suspect was driven by hatred of jews when he plotted to carry out a suicide bombing in israel with the help of islamic militants court papers released monday quoted an associate as telling investigators
the suspect stephan josef smyrek 26 from the german town of braunschweig was arrested after arriving in israel in november and on monday was ordered held until the end of his trial
the pre-trial hearings in the tel aviv district court have been held behind closed doors and much of the case against smyrek has been kept away from the public by a gag order
however on monday the court released five pages of a 12-page document that included statements smyrek made to israeli interrogators and information provided by german police
he wanted to blow himself up a woman friend of smyrek's was quoted as telling german police her name was stricken from the copies of the document given to reporters
he told me he wanted to strap grenades or a bomb to his stomach in order to blow himself uphe spoke often of his hatred for jews the woman was quoted as saying
smyrek is accused of conspiring to carry out an attack in israel harming state security and membership in a terror organization _ the iranian-backed hezbollah group which is trying to drive israeli troops out of southern lebanon
each charge carries a maximum sentence of life imprisonment
smyrek's lawyer dan assan said his client's confession to the shin bet security service was extracted by force and that he planned to contest it
assan said the state's case was weak i don't believe there is enough evidence of an act of conspiracy with hezbollah and no evidence of the planning of a suicide bombing attack in the foreseeable future assan told the associated press
the court based its decision to hold smyrek mostly on the confession and evidence provided by the german police
i decide to give my live and blood to allah to carry out the act of martyrdom smyrek told israeli interrogators on nov 29 a day after his arrest according to the court documents
smyrek born a catholic converted to islam in 1994
a lebanese resident of germany who was not further identified told the authorities that smyrek contacted several arabs in germany to help with his recruitment into hezbollah
smyrek said he also made contact with a palestinian from the west bank city of hebron who told smyrek he could become a suicide bomber for the islamic militant group hamas which is based in the west bank and gaza strip hamas has carried out more than a dozen suicide bombings in israel since 1994
smyrek told interrogators he was interested in hamas but for one reason or another lost contact
smyrek who was carrying a video camera a map of israel and dlrs 4000 at the time of his arrest told interrogators that his mission was to gather information and take it back to lebanon to the hezbollah
they didn't tell me that my mission was martyrdom and they didn't tell me for security reasons and it appears that they planned to tell me only shortly before i was to carry out the shihada he said using the arabic word martyrdom
assan said his client plans to plead innocent no trial date has been set dl-kl

democrats held a motorcade on sunday to drive home their protest against the rise in cross-harbour tunnel tolls
party protesters drove in seven cars from edinburgh place central to the western harbour crossing cross harbour tunnel and eastern harbour crossing
they handed petition letters to representatives of the tunnels' operating companies
the petitions called on the western harbour crossing management to lower its fare to a more comparable level they urged the two other companies not to raise their tolls
the toll for the eastern harbour crossing was raised by $5 to $15 on new year's day the $10 toll for the cross harbour tunnel and the $30 for the newly-opened western harbour crossing remain the same
because it was the cheapest the cross harbour tunnel attracted 1000 more vehicles a day worsening traffic congestion at the oldest crossing the democrats said
they warned that raising fares to regulate traffic flow might be used as an excuse for further increases in future
the flow through the eastern harbour crossing dropped 20 per cent after toll revision other tunnel companies may request a rise to adjust the flow of vehicles and lessen traffic congestion party spokesman andrew cheng kar-foo said
this will lead to a spiral effect of increasing tunnel tolls copyright 1998 hongkong standard all rights reserved as distributed by worldsources online inc

a former croatian soldier claimed he had testified in december before the international war crimes tribunal about the 1991 killings of serbs near gospic in central croatia
there was no immediate confirmation from the tribunal that milan levar the former military intelligence officer in gospic actually had met with investigators in the hague
if confirmed his testimony could lead to the indictment of some former high-ranking military officials in the area
levar was quoted as saying in monday's issue of the independent daily novi list that he spoke to investigators in the hague in early december
levar said he and a wartime colleague went there as as croatian defenders and volunteers in order to shed light on the crimes that unfortunately happened in the area of gospic
levar and two others already had told their story to independent croatian newspapers last summer but novi list was the first to report the two men had been in the hague
levar and his colleague reportedly blamed tihomir oreskovic and gen mirko norac military commanders in the area at the time for leading a murderous campaign against serbs and some croats in 1991
international officials have reported that up to 120 persons were then killed in the area
after levar's revelations were published in croatia miroslav banjramovic another croat fighter told a newspaper in gruesome detail how he tortured and killed more than 90 defenseless serbs in the gospic and pakrac areas
minority serbs rebelled in 1991 against croatia's independence from former yugoslavia in a subsequent six-month war the rebels seized one third of croatia non-serbs were expelled and about 10000 people were killed most of the territory was regained in 1995 military campaigns
criminal proceedings were launched recently in connection with the presumed killing of seven serbs from the gospic area no suspect has been identified yet
in addition bajramovic and eight other people were charged with 10 crimes
levar claimed he presented enough evidence to warrant indictments by the hague tribunal

a recent forum held in conjunction with trade union rights week initiated by the malaysian trades union congress has concluded that workers need to be organised to better understand their rights and find ways to protect themselves from injustices
it also agreed that to be organised did not necessarily mean trade unions workers' committees would do just as well
on the subject of workers' rights i wish to mention the role of trade unions in educating members in exercising their rights in the areas of occupational safety and health
workers must actively understand the nature of their jobs and undertake improvements at their workplace so that the risks are minimal and within their control
when negotiating collective agreements with managements trade unions should see the assurances on healthy and safe working conditions
where feasible osh programmes should be incorporated together with compulsory training for the employees
provisions must be made for training as it is an essential part of osh programmes to reduce disease and injury in the workplace
training enables managers supervisors and workers to understand the process of safety management systems they then understand their own responsibilities in the process of upgrading safety and health at the workplace
collective agreements with safeguards on osh will only enhance the management's awareness of its responsibility and help it focus better on the issues at hand as for the workers it will provide them with what is rightfully theirs
it is the management that holds the key to workplace safety and health
the occupational safety and health safety and health committee regulations 1996 make it mandatory for companies or workplaces with 40 or more workers to set up safety and health committees
a safety and health committee which comprises a chairman secretary representatives of employers and employees shall help develop safety and health rules and safe systems of work
the problems confronting migrant workers must also be addressed
the ministry of human resources can look into the possibility of making it compulsory for all foreign workers to attend osh induction programmes
such programmes should be conducted in the workers' mother tongue
basic osh programmes such as this will give them some education on occupational safety
un officials are proposing that the world body double the value of iraq's oil sales under the oil-for-food program a un spokesman said here monday
if the un security council approves the move iraq will be pumping about 16 million barrels per day on to the already saturated oil market by february said dennis halliday the un relief coordinator in iraq
halliday told the associated press that un and iraqi experts were reviewing the current program which allows the sale of dlrs 2 billion worth of oil every six months to enable the government to buy food medicine and other humanitarian supplies for its 22 million people
halliday said among the recommendations due to be finalized this week was a proposal for the un security council to take a decision which will increase iraqi revenues by 100 percent or even more
the recommendation was to implement such an increase during the current six-month phase of the program the third since it began in december 1996 halliday said
halliday said the oil-for-food scheme has done very little to alleviate the suffering of the iraqis under the sweeping un trade sanctions imposed after iraq's 1990 invasion of kuwait
the united nations he said would like to boost iraqis food rations by adding cheese and full cream powder milk to their diet the extra money was also needed to rehabilitate water purification facilities and to repair electricity plants
iraq says more than two million of its people are without electricity and three to four-hour blackouts even in the capital baghdad may occur up to four times a day
halliday said other sectors in need of urgent rehabilitation included education agriculture and poultry industries
he said he would be forwarding the recommendations to un secretary-general kofi annan who is expected to put them before the security council at the end of january
halliday was optimistic the security council would approve the recommendation
oil minister amer mohammed rashid said last week iraq would consider jan 8 as the starting date for the program's third phase and that it intended to pump 800000 barrels per day to meet its dlrs 2 billion quota in six months
oil analysts here say iraq would find no difficulty in meeting a new bigger quota the country has the capacity to export more than 2 million barrels a day well above the 16 million barrels a day envisaged by the un recommendation
the exact volume of iraqi exports would be determined by prices on the international market lower prices would mean more oil was exported
meantime an iraqi oil official said monday that his government has signed its first contracts under the program's third phase
speaking on condition of anonymity the official said the french oil companies elf aquitaine and total would be the first to pump on board the kirkuk sour grade of crude from the southern turkish terminal of ceyhan later this week lb-jbm
iraq announced monday it would block any arms inspections by an american inspector a move that could set off a new confrontation with un weapons inspectors
the announcement was made on the state-run iraqi news agency which quoted an official spokesman but gave no further details
the report by the agency came after american scott ritter and a team of un inspectors made a visit monday to iraqi government buildings near the headquarters of the un special commission which is responsible for the weapons inspection program
apparently the team was not blocked since the agency's report said the ban on ritter would begin tuesday
it quoted the government spokesman as saying that ritter's team included too many americans and britons adding the team will not be allowed to carry out inspections unless it is recomposed in a balanced manner
the official said the team included nine americans five britons a russian and an australian
this shows striking evidence of the imbalance in the composition of the team and its methods of action in iraq the spokesman said
an iraqi official said government buildings visited by ritter's team monday included a hospital and prison in baghdad

the hewlett-packard deskjet 890c which made its debut last year promises enhanced performance and fine print quality for small businesses it incorporates a technology called photoret ii that uses a new colour cartridge which according to hp produces the smallest ink drops in the desktop inkjet printer category
the deskjet 890c offers up to nine pages per minute for black printing and 5ppm for colour printing up to 600 dots per inch dpi it has 05-megabyte mb built-in random access memory ram and 32 kilobytes kb of receive buffer
the performance of the printer was actually impressive both in colour/greyscale printing and speed
to install the printer driver you can use the microsoft windows 95 3x or nt 40 driver depending on your computer's operating system in this review windows 95 was used
the printer driver or the deskjet 890c series properties comes with six options that include setup features colour and services in the setup menu you can select the print quality that you want - best normal or econofast mode you can also change the paper size and type some of the options available in features include the page orientation - portrait or landscape
in colour the options available include automatic manual and print in greyscale you can use the manual setting if you want to manually adjust the colour intensity and half-toning
in services the options available include align the print cartridges and test printer communication
there is also thedeskjet 890c series toolbox a program that provides access to all the information you need when using the printer
to see whether this printer could deliver what it promised we printed a colour image on an a4-size paper using all the print modes provided - econofast normal and best
printing the image in econofast mode was of course faster than normal or best mode however in terms of quality there was not much difference between econofast and normal
even between these two modes and the best mode there's only a slight difference
actually printing in econofast mode is not meant to provide impressive colour output as it is designed to save on ink and produce faster output
one thing that was peculiar about the econofast mode was the banding generated on the printouts which could be caused by the printhead
however these bands didn't appear either in the normal and best modes
comparing the printouts of images in normal and best modes on normal paper there was practically no difference in print quality between these two modes
however when the same graphic was printed on a special inkjet paper the image in the best mode looked far more attractive than that produced using the normal mode - the colours were more eye-catching and vibrant
in addition to the colour images we also printed graphics in greyscale and also in all the three print modes
similar to the colour printouts in the econofast mode the bands created by the printhead were very much visible
another interesting point to highlight was when we printed text in various font sizes using econofast normal and best modes
like graphics there was not much difference between econofast and normal modes for text in both modes you can only read font sizes above three points whereas in the best mode the texts looked consistent even though in the two and three points
the printer has two physical buttons - power and resume button which is used to clear miscellaneous printer problems
the deskjet 890c comes with a power cord colour and black print cartridge and the above-mentioned printer drivers and user manual

the selection process of the concept request for proposals crfps for the smart school flagship application has progressed into the second stage with 49 of the 136 submissions been shortlisted
the shortlisted companies have already been notified last month and they have been asked to form unbound consortia to submit integrated proposals based on the initial shortlisted bids for five pilot applications
the unbound consortia will comprise at least four shortlisted companies each said education ministry's education technology division director datin aishah mohd zahir
speaking on behalf of the smart school crfp secretariat aishah said each consortium is expected to submit proposals that respond to all the requirements in the five applications by march 31 this year
evaluation of the proposals will begin on may 1 after which multi-track negotiations will commence selection will be final and contract will be awarded on july 1 1998 aishah told computimes last friday
it is understood that the government will further shortlist several unbound consortia for the multi-track negotiations although the contract will be awarded to only one - the one with the best comprehensive integrated proposal
the integrated proposal should encompass the five pilot applications namely the smart school assessment system the smart school management system the smart school technology infrastructure the smart schools systems integration and the smart school teaching-learning materials which focuses on four subjects bahasa melayu english mathematics and science
the consortia is also required to propose a smart school information technology it architecture with specific components configurations and topologies identified to match the particular requirements of the 90 pilot schools
implementation for the pilots is expected to start on jan 1 1999 and itwill involve allocating the 90 schools according to predetermined levels of technology ranging frompreliminary level to the highest level
at the highest level the schools will be equipped with a high ratio of computers to teachers and schoolchildren and full multimedia facilities such as laboratories audio-visual equipment and local and wide area networks
these pilots are designed to allow for testing evaluation improvement and further fine-tuning to be made to the solutions proposed
since the pioneer schools are made up of different kinds of schools the pilots will also be tested according to the suitability of their solutions to different schools
the 90 pioneer schools are grouped in six different categories
according to the education ministry the pilots will also be an opportunity to evaluate the extent to which vendors are able to meet deadlines fulfil predetermined performance levels and generally demonstrate their implementation capabilities
the proposed design the ministry added should address strategies and mechanisms for the subsequent nationwide deployment of this architecture to an estimated 10000 primary and secondary schools nationwide by the year 2010
two top mercedes employees are under investigation for fraud and embezzlement in connection with never-realized plans to ship dlrs 870 million worth of luxury cars to russia in 1993
prosecutor sabine maylaender said on monday that payment for the 11000 cars was supposedly to have come from millions stashed away in switzerland by soviet officials in the 1980s
the two suspects allegedly negotiated the deal to the disadvantage of their employer she said a german businessman who acted as a middleman is also part of the investigation which has been under way for two years
daimler-benz parent company of mercedes declined to comment because the investigation was still open
according to a report on south german radio the cars were to be sold at inflated prices the alleged middleman received dlrs 20 million in monaco as a confidence-building measure although top mercedes managers had reservations about the deal
the middleman was to be paid dlrs 2175 million in all for disguising the source of the russian funds but the whole thing fell through further details were not immediately known pfg-aet

kuantan sun - the bodies of a mother of nine and her two sons who drowned while bathing at a disused mining pool near their house at jalan kuantan-segamat yesterday have been recovered
a villager found the body of rokiah che ibrahim 38 near where she and the children were last seen bathing in the 20-metre deep mining pool in kampung batu 17
her body was recovered at 6pm an hour after the woman and her children were believed to have drowned
kuantan police chief assistant commissioner sudin ali said scuba divers of the royal malaysian navy base in tanjung gelang assisted by police had scoured the river for the bodies of rokiah's children but to no avail
when the divers resumed their search this morning they found the bodies of mohd azrul othman four and mohd azlan othman three at the pool at 830am and 835am respectively
the bodies were taken to the tengku ampuan afzan hospital for post-mortem before being sent to the kampung baru muslim cemetery in panching timur
sudin said that initial investigations had revealed that the tragedy occurred when mohd azrul slipped and fell into the mining pool at 5pm
rokiah who was hanging clothes to dry then dived into the pool to save her son
we believe that mohd azlan seeing his mother in the pool had followed suit
mohd azrul and mohd azlan were the sixth and seventh of a family of nine aged between 18 and six months
rokiah's husband vegetable farmer othman mohamad 40 was away in gambang at the time of the incident the other children were in the house
a national migrants' group on monday blamed turkey's inability and unwillingness to solve its kurdish problem as the main reason for the recent explosion in illegal immigration of kurds to europe
two boatloads of kurds from turkey and iraq that were recently caught off italy's shores alarmed european governments which have put pressure on turkey to stop the exodus turkish authorities responded by arresting thousands of foreigners _ including iraqi kurds pakistanis and bangladeshis _ suspected of plotting to sneak into western europe
in the latest operation the police apprehended 73 europe-bound iraqi kurds in istanbul on saturday the anatolia news agency reported monday
but many have criticized the turkish government's crackdown as a cosmetic show of force that targets the wrong issues
the problem is directly related to the kurdish problem said mahmut ozgur president of the migrants cooperation association as long as conditions forcing kurds from their homes in the southeast are not solved fleeing west will continue
interior minister murat basesgioglu denied that kurdish residents were forced to flee their villages
none of our citizens in turkey either living in the southeast or the east have faced such persecution basesgioglu told state television on monday
the minister said turkey is fulfilling its responsibilities toward european union countries despite its exclusion from the union due to its kurdish problem record of human rights abuses and rifts with greece _ a european union member
they europeans have kept turkey out of the eu's expansion period and they acted unjustly he said but we are loyal to agreements signed with europe to struggle against human migration drug trafficking and organized crimes

kuala lumpur sun - book sales in the klang valley have been slow after the new retail prices of imported books were introduced
the new price list drawn up by the malaysian importers' association has been distributed to bookstore owners and some are already selling their books at the new rates

books on photography and video from the uk which were selling for rm1990 were now priced at rm2990
ms bookmark sdn bhd manager hm low said the price increase would result in customers having lower purchasing power and sales coming down
bookstore owners will have to find ways and means to maintain their business under the current economic situation
joseph ng a customer spotted at mph bookstores in bukit bintang said the price increase affected him as he normally bought books for his work
i am given only rm300 for projects carried out by the company i am working for and with the new rates i have to be more selective in buying books
a regular customer of mph bookstores s segaran who is a sales executive in petaling jaya said he would be spending less on books
he said the prices of books at present were already high and the increase had discouraged people from buying books
he added that it would be worse for people with children because they would have to spend a substantial amount on books

the member of parliament for batu pahat mansor masikon aspires to make batu pahat an important growth centre and a garden city
he does not want rapid growth to rob the town of its natural beauty and charm and takes a personal interest in the development of the district
i want to make batu pahat an ideal place to work and live this means balanced development so that there is both physical growth and social progress for the people
towards this end several big infrastructure projects will be initiated he says
mansor says a big mixed housing development has just started in tongkang pecah involving 4000ha and the construction of more than 5000 low-cost houses
the demand for affordable housing has long been felt by the residents here the situation has worsened in recent years due to rapid urbanisation and the migration of people from the northern states
we hope more private developers will invest here those already here are mainly small-timers whose projects are also very small
so there is only a small number of new units coming into the market
the problem is especially acute in senggarang and rengit as there is no more government land for housing development
the only way out is for landowners in the areas concerned to offer their land for housing development i have already spoken to a few and their response has been positive
it is only a matter of time before new housing projects get started here
mansor is also flooded with complaints about low water pressure in the constituency but this will soon be over with the construction of a new water treatment plant in sri gading which is scheduled for completion in the middle of next year
he says elevated water tanks would be built in several areas to boost water pressure
once these two projects are completed in 1999 we will not only have enough water but the problem of low pressure will also be a thing of the past he says
mansor is also excited about the tanjung lapoh industrial estate for small and medium-scale industries coming up on a 20ha site
he says this will nicely house all illegal factories operating in shophouses in the district adding that the new industrial project will be completed in three years
construction is expected to start this year provided approvals are granted by the land and district offices
plans are also afoot to set up an institut teknologi mara branch campus in the constituency a boarding school will also be built to cater for rural students seeking higher education in batu pahat
mansor is particularly pleased to see the realisation of batu pahat's flood mitigation programme with which he has been closely associated since his election as mp in 1995
the five-year programme which will be completed by 2000 will resolve the district's flood woes
he has also been closely monitoring the project to upgrade rural roads in the constituency about 90 per cent of the roads are already sealed while the rest will be done within the next few years
batu pahat has seen a satisfactory level of infrastructure development since 1995 several more new projects are on the cards and these will go a long way to transform batu pahat into johor's new growth centre
concerted plans are also under way to beautify the town and make it into a garden city
born in rengit mansor attended the english college in johor baru and later did his chartered secretarial and chartered insurance studies at mara in 1967
he obtained an advanced diploma in business administration at london polytechnic in 1974
he served as director with several insurance companies before entering politics in 1995 mansor has two service centres - one in batu pahat and the other in rengit

villagers in the remote hebei province counties of shangyi and zhangbei went without shelter on saturday night despite freezing weather after being warned of possible aftershocks from the earthquake that struck earlier in the day
temperatures plummeted to minus 20 degrees celsius overnight in the counties according to news reports
after the 1150am earthquake which measured 62 on the richter scale authorities warned people not to stay in their houses which could prove to be deadly traps in the event of a major aftershock
in nanfangbei a village about 10 kilometres from the centre of the earthquake villagers on saturday night sifted through the rubble of their demolished homes
many villagers had to cook over makeshift stoves as children huddled in haystacks for warmth
we stuffed the kids into the straw while the adults huddled outside by the fire li yuming a 38-year-old farmer said
a farmer in xishungou 30 km south of the earthquake's epicentre said he and his wife and their son shivered through the night in a haystack too afraid of aftershocks to sleep in their cracked mud house
it was so cold that we could not sleep chen yi said
authorities said on sunday that more than 100 aftershocks had been registered they said another aftershock of around 5 on the richter scale was likely such an aftershock could cause considerable damage in rural villages
meanwhile local schools have been turned into shelters for the homeless and vendors were providing hot noodles a local official said
iraq announced monday it would block any arms inspections by american scott ritter a move that could set off a new confrontation with un weapons inspectors
the announcement was made on the state-run iraqi news agency which quoted an official spokesman who said the presence of too many american inspectors was prolonging the inspections program and delaying removal of curbs on iraq's oil exports
the agency's report came after ritter and a team of un inspectors made a visit monday to iraqi government buildings near the headquarters of the un special commission which is responsible for the weapons inspection program
apparently the team was not blocked since the agency's report said the ban on ritter would begin jan 13 tuesday
it quoted the government spokesman as saying ritter's team included too many americans and britons adding the team will not be allowed to carry out inspections unless it is reformed in a balanced manner
the official who was not identified by the agency said the team included nine americans five britons a russian and an australian
this shows striking evidence of the imbalance in the composition of the team and its methods of action in iraq the spokesman said
an iraqi official said government buildings visited by ritter's team monday included a hospital and prison in baghdad
in new york ewen buchanan a spokesman for the un inspection teams said the united nations had not been informed officially of the iraqi decision to block inspections led by ritter
we're trying to find out what this means buchanan said
ritter was severely criticized by iraq at the time that it blocked american weapons inspectors from working in iraq last october which led to a three-week break in the weapons inspections
the iraqi spokesman also accused american weapons inspectors of carrying out activities detrimental to iraq's national interest
they have been falsifying facts inventing lies deliberately prolonging the process and sending false reports to the security council the agency quoted him as saying
the continuation of this situation is unacceptable he added
the latest row comes just a week before a scheduled visit to iraq by un chief inspector richard butler an australian to solve outstanding issues related to access to sensitive sites like presidential palaces
during last fall's confrontation iraq accused american inspectors of spying on iraq and helping plan for us attacks on the country un officials denied the charges and pulled all weapons inspectors out of the country the impasse was ended with russian mediation
the inspectors' job is to certify that iraq has fulfilled its obligation under un resolutions to eliminate its weapons of mass destruction
sanctions imposed on iraq following its 1990 invasion of neighboring kuwait _ which include a ban on the export of oil _ cannot be lifted until the un security council accepts that iraqi weapons programs have been halted
iraq maintains it has fulfilled the requirements under security council resolutions but the weapons inspectors have repeatedly accused the government of president saddam hussein of hiding weapons and the means to manufacture them lb-ggl

datuk zainalabidin mohd zin plans to keep his pledge to tar all kampung roads and supply water to all households in his constituency by the year 2000
he is confident of fulfilling his promise already 72 per cent of the rural roads have been tarred and 97 per cent of houses connected with water pipes
however many households are still not getting regular water supply due to low water pressure
rengit a predominantly rural area of 38387ha is made up of four mukim - minyak beku kampung baru sungei punggor and sungei kluang
there are only two towns in the constituency - rengit and senggarang
malays make up 84 per cent of the 47000 population chinese constitute 159 per cent while the rest are indians
the majority of the people are either farmers or smallholders cultivating oil palm cocoa coffee rubber and vegetables or breeders of sheep and goats
industries here are agriculture-based with 20 small and medium-scale factories processing palm oil and coffee or manufacturing snacks using tapioca and sweet potatoes
there are also some coastal settlers in the constituency with 175 families depending on fishing for a livelihood
zainalabidin says because of the range of economic activities the population was spread over a wide area which made it difficult to meet infrastructure needs
in some places there are only two or three houses but we still have to build roads for their convenience i will continue to make this my top priority he says
although still largely rural rengit has had its share of new development an example of this are two new housing projects which offer 400 low-cost houses
there are about 1000 applicants on the waiting list for low-cost housing in the constituency
zainalabidin says other notable development projects include a new fire station in jalan besar rengit which will be operational by march
previously residents depended on the fire station in batu pahat which is a 30-minute drive away for emergency services
a multi-purpose community hall the first in the area will also be opened to the public by march
in pekan rengit a building with a food court will be built soon to house hawkers and petty traders a public library which is under construction will also be ready by the end of the year
located at the sri merlong village head centre at sungei kluang the library would also be developed into an information technology centre
zainalabidin says plans are also under way to develop sri merlong a remote area into a new growth centre with a full range of services and facilities
this includes houses shops clinics banks and agriculture-based industries
the area now has no water supply and the road is in bad condition but we plan to transform it into a town within the next four years
in senggarang plans are also afoot to build a market and a hawker centre for the people
on the low water pressure in rengit zainalabidin says syarikat air johor will build elevated water tanks in two areas in rengit to overcome the problem
he says the johor government has also allocated rm191 million to upgrade rural roads including the tarring of 212km of them

dr chua soi lek ran a successful medical practice in batu pahat before opting for politics during that period he had the opportunity to feel the pulse on the ground which explains his relatively easy transition into politics
he is a familiar face in the constituency having served there as a government medical officer and a private practitioner
his ready smile and warm personality has endeared him to the people in particular the old folk they remember him making his rounds in the kampung as a doctor in the district hospital
he had no qualms about knocking on the doors of the villagers to engage them in conversation about their health and personal well-being
his strong command of bahasa malaysia coupled with his gregarious personality were the qualities which caught the attention of the mca power brokers who quickly roped him in
dr chua now into his third term as state assemblyman and his second as johor state executive councillor says he has never regretted his switch
in many ways he says a politician's life is similar to that of a doctor - they help people solve problems
and this is precisely what dr chua has accomplished as the wakil rakyat for penggaram which covers half of batu pahat town with a mix of urban and rural voters
during his tenure as assemblyman the constituency has seen rapid transformation with 99 per cent of households having electricity supply and 95 per cent with piped water tarred roads link over 90 per cent of the rural villages
but dr chua will perhaps be best remembered as the man who worked tirelessly to secure government funds to alleviate batu pahat's flood woes
under a five-year flood mitigation project spread over five development packages the government will spend rm48 million phase one of the first package in jalan parit dhoby has been completed and the tenders for its other two phases are out
the first phase of the second package in jalan sultanah has been completed while another phase is 20 per cent completed package three in bakau chondong is almost completed
the last of the four packages is the largest which involves the alteration of the bakau chondong and sri molek drainage system
dr chua hopes the project will put an end to the nightmares of batu pahat residents who have endured floods for over 35 years
he also came to the aid of the five independent chinese schools by helping to raise rm250000 to upgrade facilities and services
it is my hope that all 18 chinese schools with 10000 pupils in penggaram would be upgraded during my term he says
but he laments that much more needs to be done among them easing the town's traffic congestion
my greatest task is to put the town's traffic system in order the number of cars has increased but the roads are still the same
another of his priorities is the relocation of illegal factories now operating at shophouses in housing estates more than 80 per cent of the 400 factories are reported to be sited on land that has not been zoned for industrial use
we are taking measures to identify suitable industrial land we are doing this on a case-by-case basis with allocations for hostels for workers
dr chua says there is also a dire need to improve public transport services as this is one of the main reasons for the lack of takers for low-cost houses built outside of town
the squatter problem is also on his priority list most of them are vegetable farmers encroaching on state land he has advised them to apply through their associations for land under the recently-announced agriculture zone covering 12000ha in mersing kluang and kota tinggi
dr chua's service centre in jalan rahmat batu pahat is opened on fridays from 10am to noon and 3pm to 5pm and sundays from 10am to noon
the telephone number is 07-4317188 and fax number is 07-4324662

an ethnic albanian loyal to the serbian state was shot and killed and a serb police building riddled with bullets in kosovo on monday
the latest flare-up in the restive province occurred only days before the announced visit by the top us diplomat for the balkans robert gelbard who has recently warned kosovo's albanians to refrain from violence
muja sejdi a 52-year-old woodcutter from the village of gradica 40 kilometers 25 miles west of the provincial capital pristina was shot and killed monday morning by masked assailants using automatic rifles state-run radio pristina reported
sejdi is the eleventh ethnic albanian loyal to the serbian state to be killed in kosovo in the past 18 months
all previous attacks were claimed by an ethnic albanian terrorist group called the kosovo liberation army which calls for an armed rebellion against serbia
in another incident on monday unknown assailants sprayed a building housing families of serb policemen with bullets in the village of stimlja some 30 kilometers 18 miles south of pristina some 30 bullets were fired but no one was injured pristina radio said
in the serbian capital of belgrade a ten-member delegation of
kosovo serbs arrived to demand protection from the yugoslav president slobodan milosevic against the liberation army's attacks it was not clear whether milosevic would meet them at all

the belgian soccer federation complained monday that fifa has offered it far too few tickets for its world cup games while scalpers are calling in with offers of thousands of seats at hugely inflated prices
it's almost hopeless there is just no way to give the ordinary fan a ticket said jan peeters secretary general of the belgian federation
our best fans will miss it all
belgium was offered just 5400 seats at the 80000-capacity stade de france in saint-denis for its opening game against the netherlands on june 13
the federation has already had 120000 requests for seats from belgian fans eager to see the game against traditional rivals in a stadium just 85 minutes away from brussels by train
peeters already called fifa on friday to complain and was writing an official letter monday he also plans a joint protest with the netherlands who also were offered a limited amount of tickets
belgium is expected to get some 3000 tickets for its second first-round game against mexico in bordeaux on june 20 and 4000 for its last group game against south korea on june 25 in paris
at the same time scalpers are already calling federation headquarters offering thousands of tickets at over six times the official rate peeters said tickets were offered at 9400 francs dlrs 250 while the official rate was 1500 francs dlrs 40
it's proof the ticket system doesn't work this is wrong peeters said
most tickets for the 64 games have already been allocated and the chase for the remaining seats is hot the host nation is getting some two thirds of ticket sales and peeters feared many of those ended up on the parallel black market
this can have a lot of repercussions on security in the stadiums he said seats allocated to different federations are segregated but ticket sales on the black market could create a volatile mix of fans in the stands rac-pa

rattled by rising interest rates the failure of a major hong kong-based investment bank and the sharp decline on wall street on friday the hong kong market's hang seng index tumbled 87 percent or 77358 points to 812106 _ its lowest level since march 1995 last week the index dropped 16 percent
a hong kong bank clerk chau ho-yeung said his dlrs 9000 investment was now worth dlrs 1300
i'm expecting the worst i've lost everything and i'm now only holding on to a pile of wastepaper chau said
the failed investment bank that upset hong kong markets was peregrine investment holdings whose ability to obtain repayment of loans to indonesia was thrown in doubt by a severe plunge in the value of the rupiah currency last week
peregrine which announced it had begun liquidation monday had been one of asia's foremost investment houses
french president jacques chirac said the financial crisis in asia will affect european growth this year but that it is too early to estimate its extent he urged asian countries to follow imf guidelines
on friday there was 282 percent decline on wall street because of growing concern over asia's economic turmoil which began last summer and has since forced the imf to give large bailout loans to thailand indonesia and south korea
such concerns prompted stanley fischer the imf's first deputy managing director to begin talks sunday with officials in indonesia on its dlrs 40 billion imf-led rescue package
last week the bailout came close to stalling when the government unveiled a budget short of reforms the plan required
but fischer emerged from a meeting with president suharto monday hopeful that indonesia would soon announce substantive reforms
also monday deputy us treasury secretary lawrence summers stressed the need for the sweeping reforms in meetings with finance officials in jakarta he meets with suharto on tuesday before visiting other asian nations
later this week the imf chief michel camdessus and the us defense secretary william cohen also will travel to indonesia
such efforts appeared to begin to pay off monday when share prices rose 21 percent on the jakarta stock exchange
in seoul the korea stock exchange closed 243 percent higher on strong buying interest from local investors analysts said apparently boosted by positive comments from the imf chief
upon arriving there camdessus said he was satisfied with reforms made by south korea as conditions of the imf's dlrs 57 billion bailout

kuala lumpur sun - pemadam vice-chairman datuk lee lam thye today called for concerted effort by parents and teachers to combat the dadah menace through preventive education at schools and homes
he said pemadam was convinced that this was the most effective strategy to curb the menace
therefore the education ministry which recently introduced dadah prevention programmes in all schools should also invite parent teacher associations to participate in the programmes
ptas play an important role in fighting dadah abuse among students through supervision and parental guidance
pemadam welcomes the introduction of the new programme and is prepared to play its role to make it a success lee said in a statement
he said that according to the national dadah council a total of 127119 addicts were identified between 1988 and 1996 with about 80 per cent of them aged between 15 and 39
lee added that although the ministry's statistics revealed that 117 students were involved in dadah abuse between january and september last year the figure could be higher
given this figure it should be a matter of concern and it is therefore most approriate for us to work for a dadah-free school environment he said
lee also said awards should be given to dadah-free schools in recognition of their efforts to stave off the menace
germany's soccer chief egidius braun on monday criticized england for mounting a challenge to germany for the right to bid for the 2006 world cup
braun said he found it a little bit ill-mannered that england was seeking to stage the world cup so soon after hosting the european championship in 1996
in an interview with the cologne-based deutschlandfunk german radio braun said england was investing a lot of money in its effort to win the bid at the expense of germany
germany's bid would have to be seen in connection with german reunification and the political changes in europe and the world braun told the radio station which provided a summary of his comments
england and germany have been locked in a bitter rivalry to win the right to stage the biggest event in sports after the olympics
germany says it was the first to launch its bid and that england broke a gentleman's agreement by jumping into the race with a vigorous campaign
france will host this summer's world cup and japan and south korea will co-cost the 2002 championship
sepp blatter secretary general of fifa soccer's world governing body indicated last week that fifa may award the 2006 world cup to a country in africa rather than picking between germany and england two of the most influential soccer nations in europe
germany last hosted the world cup in 1974 while england staged the event in 1966 both teams won the title on their soil

the coalition mustered only a 54-54 tie in the vote with two members of the 120-seat parliament abstaining
monday's vote was the first since the david levy's resigned as foreign minister last week reducing the size of the ruling coalition from 66 to 61 in the 120-member knesset four of the five members of levy's gesher faction voted with the opposition
in addition three coalition legislators are abroad and three likud rebels _ former cabinet ministers dan meridor and benny begin as well as legislator david reem _ absented themselves to show their displeasure over netanyahu's policies
opposition member salah tarif was absent had he been present the opposition would have won a majority but even that would have been insufficient because under a new electoral law an absolute majority of 61 lawmakers is needed to topple the ruling coalition

the malaysian rubber market is likely to be touching the 300 sen level this week on price adjustment dealers said
at last week's close february rss-one surged nine sen to 28450 sen per kg while smr 20 jumped 65 sen to 27950 sen
further price adjustments are expected should the ringgit's value which was quoted at 45600/00 to the us dollar late last week continued to be weaker a dealer said
primary industries minister datuk seri dr lim keng yaik last friday expressed dissatisfaction with the failure of rubber prices to improve from the current level
he said the prices should have blown up to 360 sen given the fact that the value of the ringgit has depreciated by about 60 per cent since the currency problems began in july last year
he pointed out that all commodities such as crude palm oil tin timber cocoa and petroleum were doing very well following the depreciation of the ringgit but this was not the case for rubber
as major producing countries accounting for 85 per cent of the world's natural rubber production therefore dr lim said it was timely for exporters from thailand indonesia and malaysia to co-ordinate and co-operate among each other to determine much better prices
meanwhile as for this week's trading a dealer said there was no indication of any sort that demand would improve in a big way
in the week just ended some enquiries were noted from the middle east and europe for 1000 tonnes of the smr 20 grade for february shipment on thursday and this at least added some positive sentiment to the market
the international natural rubber organisation's inro daily market indicator price for jan 8 was quoted at 19236 malaysia/singapore cents per kg compared with 18774 on jan 2

the ford motor company won't be cutting back on its investment plans for south-east asia where it expects to see an economic recovery in two years its vice-chairman w wayne booker said yesterday
ford is not changing any of its plans for asia said booker in an interview with business times
booker is responsible for ford's presence in markets ranging from china and japan through south-east asia and india to russia and belarus
the motor vehicle manufacturer has already begun trial runs at its new us$500 million us$1 rm463 plant outside bangkok continuing its discussions to launch its transit commercial vehicle in china and holding discussions to re-enter the philippines market
everything is more or less on schedule we're looking at this as a window of economic slowdown but not a permanent situation in any way
booker admits the magnitude and timing of the region's economic adjustments were unexpected but that has not changed ford's investment philosophy for the region
we will continue on with our basic strategy and look at opportunities to make sure we are strongly positioned as the economies come out of this situation
now is the time for us to get very serious about increasing our presence we believed that before this crisis happened and we still believe that we're prepared to ride it out
it is not the first time ford has stayed on in a troubled region - it remained in mexico during the peso crisis - and ford's strategy in south-east asia will be to continue developing its distribution network and invest in manufacturing facilities
what we did in mexico was we continued on with our investment strategy and didn't flinch
we continued to support our dealers and strengthen our product line-up
today mexico has resumed its growth and so have we
when the region recovers booker believes it will be stronger with more financial reality in the situation
the growth is there you can't take that away from the people they will force growth
there is a lot of entrepreneurial knowhow in south-east asia and i believe that will come through
booker said ford believes that the adjustments in the region will have to be looked at country by country and in some cases the recovery will be quicker than it will be in others
in the case of malaysia and the philippines booker believes the situation is less dramatic than it might be in some of the other countries therefore i think we are looking at no more than two years for the growth in these economies to resume
i don't think there is much that needs to be done that isn't being done and the government has reacted very responsibly as far as we are concerned
the fall of markets such as thailand said booker has little relation to malaysia for ford
i think its the psychological impact rather than the real impact
he also said ford would like to see the initiatives started by association of south east asian nations to bring down trade barriers and work together as a common economy continue
we believe the asia pacific area is the last great growth market in the world and therefore even though we are going through this temporary situation painful as it may be right now on a long term basis there is no reason to not have great confidence in these economies being very strong and very vital in the future
south-east asia's motor vehicle industry will be able to survive the crisis added booker but it will have to face new challenges such as meeting new environmental standards changing trade barriers and later a borderless motor vehicle market
what ford would like to see changed in the region's motor vehicle industry said booker is the elimination of national barriers and a movement to a structure similar to the europe's common market
for now however booker accepts that profits from its south-east asian markets like malaysia will be done substantially as absolute volume in the motor vehicle industry drops
but ford will stay on because we have a long term strategy and you have go through these periods
we are going through something that is somewhat difficult but it isn't the end of the world

an american sculptor who works in the deserts of arizona on monday won the dlrs 100000 wolf prize for the arts
james turrell 54 of flagstaff arizona was honored for his highly individualist imagery which is a spiritualized synthesis of form and light in seemingly infinite space the prize committee said
turrell's major work is an interactive sculpture and observatory he calls a celestial theater that he is building at roden crater an extinct volcano in arizona's painted desert
turrell's works are represented in more than 30 major museums in 10 countries the california native has had solo exhibitions in london philadelphia mexico city jerusalem los angeles new york and amsterdam
the wolf prizes are given annually for outstanding achievements in physics chemistry medicine agriculture mathematics and the arts israeli president ezer weizman will present the awards in jerusalem in may
the wolf foundation was established in 1975 by ricardo wolf a german-born diplomat and philanthropist who immigrated to cuba and served as cuban ambassador to israel where he died in 1981
hours before 19 european nations were to sign an agreement to prohibit the genetic replication of human beings french president jacques chirac on monday called for an international ban on human cloning
nineteen member nations of the council of europe planned to sign a protocol that would commit their countries to prohibiting any intervention seeking to create human beings genetically identical to another human being whether living or dead
britain and germany though kept their distance from the protocol a measure that london considers too strict and bonn too mild
chirac's speech came two days after us president bill clinton blasted a chicago physicist's intention to clone humans as unsafe and morally unacceptable and urged the us congress to outlaw human cloning
chirac told a meeting of members of european national ethics committees that it is on the international level that one must ban cloning and the genetic manipulation susceptible to altering the character of the human species
the july 1996 presentation of dolly the sheep the world's first cloned mammal set off a storm of international outcry over the implications for human biology
many us and international leaders renewed their condemnation after chicago scientist richard seed said jan 7 that he planned to begin working on human cloning using a newly developed technique
we would resolve nothing in banning certain practices in one country if the doctors and researchers can develop them elsewhere said chirac it is thus how one should stop the worrying trend that some people have publicly foreseen in the united states chirac said
the 40-member council of europe which was founded in 1949 to promote democracy human rights and the rule of law called monday's protocol europe's response to the threat of human cloning following the experiments that led to dolly
the cloning protocol agreed to by european leaders at a summit last october will not include two of europe's biggest countries among others
germany claims the measure is weaker than a current german law that forbids all research on human embryos _ a legacy of the nazis' attempts before and during world war ii to conduct genetic engineering of humans
our national rules and regulations are stricter said leni fischer president of the parliamentary assembly of the council of europe
she told german television that germany would like to see higher minimum standards at the european level especially in such areas as the use of embryos
britain with a strong tradition of defending the freedoms of scientific research also refused to join the protocol
the protocol is an amendment to the council's convention on human rights and bio-medicine which was signed in 1996 in oviedo spain
the united states japan canada and the vatican participated in drafting the protocol which must be ratified by signatory nations before taking effect
the countries signing monday are denmark estonia finland france greece iceland italy latvia luxembourg macedonia moldova norway portugal romania san marino slovenia spain sweden and turkey

first pacific is seeking to sell its 40 per cent stake in the dutch trading company hagemeyer for about us$155 billion hk$1209 billion in a bid to strengthen its position in the face of the ongoing regional turmoil
the sale is part of an asset disposal program tipped to raise some us$2 billion based on prevailing market values
first pacific together with hagemeyer's top management will undertake a roadshow immediately after the announcement of hagemeyer's results next month to seek the best offer the spokesman said
we believe that once hagemeyer's results have been announced the share price will stabilise and we can get a good price for our stake the spokesman said
first pacific bought a 51 per cent stake in hagemeyer for us$30 million in 1983
in recent weeks hagemeyer's share price has dropped from about 90 to 95 dutch guilders hk$346-hk$366 to 81 dutch guilders principally as a result of rumours that it would be sold
really we're damned if we sell and damned if we don't said first pacific managing director manuel pangilinan
the group also announced it was negotiating to sell other businesses for about us$450 million and planned to use the proceeds to reduce its debt and buy assets in asia
analysts said by selling hagemeyer first pacific would trade its fastest-growing business for a chance to cut its debt and sharpen its focus on asia
the disposal of the unit will allow first pacific to wipe us$11 billion off its us$32 billion debt
also first pacific expects to book a one-time gain of more than us$500 million from the sale reflected in its 1998 interim results
while hagemeyer accounted for about one-third of the group's earnings mr pangilinan said this would not decline because interest on bank deposits and cost savings from reduced interest on debt will offset the drop in contributions from hagemeyer in 1998
the group is planning to use the us$2 billion proceeds from its asset disposal program to buy asian companies
first pacific is also injecting us$300 million its philippine unit metro pacific corp seeking new foreign partners for its 530-acre redevelopment of an army base in manila and negotiating to buy control of the philippines' biggest brewery san miguel corp mr pangilinan said
first pacific fell 78 per cent in the past six months the worst performance in hong kong's 33-company hang seng index
last week shares in the 16-year-old company fell to a four-and-a-half year low of $215

following renewed weakness on the overall trend of the market investors continued to seek out stocks with defensive quality amid the current economic situation in other words investors look out for fundamental values of stocks that can withstand further market weakness
some institutional investors are already seeking out fresh stocks for their 1998 portfolio most of them are applying the top down and bottom up approach in their sector screening and stock selection exercises
on this basis many institutions in terms of sector weighting are favouring four broad sectors ie gaming plantations utilities and export-driven manufacturing firms petronas gas bhd pgas is included in some of these institutions' portfolio for its strong cashflows and balance sheets
pgas was listed on the main board of the kuala lumpur stock exchange on sept 4 1995 it was first incorporated as a private limited company on may 23 1983 under the name petronas gas sdn bhd and wholly-owned by petroliam nasional bhd petronas on march 23 1995 it became a public limited company known as petronas gas bhd
pgas has been operating as a throughput company providing gas processing and transmission services to petronas and its customers the company presently operates four gas processing plants gpp in kertih terengganu with a combined production capacity of 1000 mmscfd of sales gas for supply to customers in the power industrial and commercial sectors by the end of 1998 the company's gas production will increase to 2000 mmscfd with the completion of the gpp 5 and 6 projects in kampung tok arun dungun terengganu
other gas components such as ethane propane and butane are being extracted by the gpp for use as feedstock to cater for the petrochemical industry in peninsular malaysia
in all 1123 kilometres of main pipeline and laterals have been laid to transport sales gas to various demand areas in the east south and west coasts of the peninsular under the peninsular gas utilisation pgu project
with the pgu project still on-going another 266 kilometres of main pipeline are being laid to further extend the gas supply network to the northen region of the peninsular by 1998
chartwise pgas' price trend rose steadily from rm810 on nov 13 1995 to its all-time historical peak at rm1220 on march 25 1996 giving a gain of rm410 or 5062 per cent from its rm810 base level
after topping out at rm1220 level pgas' price trend retraced to rm775 on april 16 1997 before rebounding to rm1040 on oct 8 lack of follow- through buying support sent pgas' price trend retracing lower to rm685 on nov 20 a brief rally to rm1000 level on dec 8 followed by a counter- trend move to rm745 on jan 9 before rebounding to close at rm790 level
here are the readings of some of its technical indicators- moving averages pgas' price trend stayed below its 10- 20- 30- 50- 100- and 200-day moving averages
momentum index its short-term momentum index had since retraced back to its critical support level
on balance volume its short-term obv trend continued to stay below its 10-day exponential moving averages
relative strength index its 14-rsi continued to trade within the confines of its neutral trading zone
outlook pgas has the most secure monopolistic protection of all the infrastructure-related companies in malaysia heavy capital investment in gas processing plants and pipelines are strong entry barriers to discourage a second operator
petronas which is pgas' major shareholder with a controlling stake of 7492 per cent or 135 billion shares as at june 30 1997 is the sole supplier of natural gas to pgas this long-term supply arrangement is very unlikely to be revoked given its large controlling block of pgas
petronas' long-term gas supply agreements with independent power producers will ensure long-term gas throughput requirements higher demand for power usage in the country will certainly increase higher throughput requirements
the company has a well-protected throughput fee structure with petronas which ensures capital cost recovery as well as long-term earnings stream
with the completion of gpp 5 and 6 projects the doubling of its production capacity by early 1999 will further boost earnings
many institutional investors like pgas as a long-term core holding as they believe the stock deserves premium to the market as it provides a long-term defensive and quality earnings base for the year ending march 31 1997 the profit after taxation amounted to rm833531 million or a net earning per share of 463 sen
technically pgas' price trend fluctuated within a wide band over the last few months in tandem with the overall market weakness on the local bourse as well as the currency turmoil in the region given its 4385 per cent retracement rm1220-rm685 pgas has definitely displayed underlying resilience of a defensive stock
its price trend will continue to trade within a stabilising trading range over the next few months for now its price trend will trade within a trading range from rm700 to rm950 levels for a solid defensive quality stock pgas' future perspectives look bright and promising from the calculation of a unique gas throughput fee the 95 per cent component of the formula was fixed in 1995 with annual compound growth of about 70 per cent to 2000

the currency and stock market problems faced by countries in south-east asia and east asia are among the various issues expected to be discussed at a two-day fourth pacific dialogue starting today
scheduled to be launched by prime minister datuk seri dr mahathir mohamad the participants will also discuss issues pertaining to cooperation in terms of regional security culture and civilisation
deputy prime minister and finance minister datuk seri anwar ibrahim will chair the dialogue which gathers politicians policy-makers academicians and business leaders from countries of the pacific rim
speaking to reporters after meeting former us secretary of state dr henry kissinger in kuala lumpur yesterday anwar said he is pleased with the attendance for this year's dialogue despite the region experiencing a aperiod of economic turbulence
we have seen so much support and enthusiasm not only from the region but also from the us for example we have seen a very high level of high-ranking delegation from the us who will be attending this dialogue
they include the us secretary of defence william cohen and kissinger as well as several american business leaders like the american international group chairman maurice greenberg
this is a welcome signal of continued relations not only because they came here for the dialogue but they have also indicated their strong commitment to continue to invest and work together in this country he added
cohen and kissinger are among 63 participants who will attend the dialogue
the dialogue is jointly organised by the institute of strategic and international studies malaysia the washington-based asia pacific policy centre and the malaysian institute of policy studies
it was first held in penang in 1994
at the press conference anwar was also asked to clarify on the issue of redeployment of foreign workers to other sectors
he said the redeployment of foreign workers will only be given to those whose permits are yet to expire but had their services terminated because of the economic slowdown
for example foreign workers in the construction sector whose permits have yet to expire but had their services terminated can seek to be redeployed in other sectors such as in plantations he added
anwar who is also the cabinet committee on foreign workers chairman said the affected workers must adhere to the procedures set by the relevant authorities such as the immigration department if they intend to seek redeployment in other sectors
however redeployment would not apply to those foreign workers whose working permits had expired he said when asked to comment on contradicting statements by several quarters pertaining to the redeployment of foreign workers over the last few days
on the number of foreign workers expected to be redeployed anwar said the immigration department and the manpower department of the human resources ministry should have the figure as these departments are monitoring the situation and the registration of these workers is also conducted by them

share prices on the kuala lumpur stock exchange took another roller-coaster ride triggered by the renewed weakness on the regional currency markets equities markets throughout the region fell in tandem with many markets cracking through key support levels
the local market opened last monday on a weak note despite the news on the merger of finance companies a slump in the ringgit to new lows and the profit-taking liquidations in the finance sector drove the local benchmark klse composite index lower at the close the klse ci dropped 2517 points or 440 per cent to the 54679 level
when the ringgit continued to record fresh lows of 43450 to the us dollar and further losses on the finance stocks after the year end run-up on merger hopes investors appear to be resigned to the prolonged weakness in the ringgit and the stock market
continuing weakness in the regional currency markets was evident and last wednesday the ringgit dropped to record a low of 48800 to the dollar but recovered in late afternoon trading blue-chip and index-linked stocks fell in tandem but pulled from their worst levels after the bank negara intervention
following the ringgit recovery the klse ci rebounded from its intra-day low of 50159 last wednesday to close at 52100 showing a marginal loss of 474 points or 09 per cent
regional routs particularly in indonesian rupiah and stocks turned sentiment on the regional equities markets to deteriorate further against the backdrop of a sharp fall of 1195 per cent in the jakarta composite index the klse ci staged a brave attempt when it rallied briefly in morning trading but lost momentum after the lunch break at the close the klse ci eased 1384 points to 50716
regional currency weakness also caused a spillover effect continuing weakness on the rupiah had continued to cap the recovery of market sentiment on the local front so long as the regional currencies continue getting hit market forces will continue to have a negative impact on the ringgit
reflecting the deterioration of the overall market sentiment the klse ci dipped below the critical 500-level support when it dropped 8036 points or 1405 per cent over the week to close at 49160 points last friday
the klse all share emas index fell in tandem when it retraced 1950 points or 1333 per cent to 12677 the klse industrial index lost 7658 points or 700 per cent to 101675 the klse second board index declined 2669 points or 1732 per cent to 12742
chartwise the klse ci retraced on the opening bell on follow-through selling pressure on finance stocks blue-chip and index-linked stocks came under selling pressure when investors sold off their positions
the klse ci hit a new low of 50159 last thursday later it recovered to close off its low at 52100 however the klse ci dipped below the 500-level for the major part of the trading day before recovering marginally to close at 49160 last friday
following are the readings of some of its technical indicators-moving averages the klse ci continued to stay below its 10- 20- 30- 50- 100- and 200-day moving averages
momentum index its short-term momentum index retraced below its neutral reference when it was stopped out by its previous peak's resistance
on balance volume its short-term obv trend weakened considerably when it fell below its 10-day exponential moving averages
relative strength index its 14-rsi continued to fluctuate within the confines of its neutral trading zone
outlook the overall market sentiment was further weakened by the continuing weakness in the regional currency markets renewed weakness in the rupiah and baht pulled down other currencies in this region including the ringgit
in reaction to the renewed weakness in the regional currencies the local stock market was not spared the spillover effect when it spiralled downwards to its intra-week low of 48412 before rebounding to close off its weekly low at 49160 last friday
following its breach below the critical 500-level support the klse ci had since retraced to its seven-year low the klse ci had its second crack at the 500 resistance was on oct 4 1989 when it closed at 50786 its first crossing of the 500-level resistance was in june 1981 based on the theoretical calculations worked-back to 1977
given the continuing weakness in the regional currency markets the ringgit will continue to tag along the direction of these regional currencies the currency spillover effect will somehow influence the overall market sentiment on the local equities front
this week the klse ci will continue to consolidate at current levels with rather minimal downside risks judging from the klse ci's non-linear trendline see weekly bar chart - a3-a4 the klse ci is ready to move out of its intermediate-term downtrend most probably in another week or two
elsewhere the klse sbi's volatility had since contracted considerably when it broke below the the critical 130-level resistance despite displaying a positive divergence the klse sbi's downside momentum had since slowed down however its short-term moving averages have yet to reverse its bearish direction
turmoil on asian markets helped send the south african rand to a record low against the us dollar on monday
share prices on the johannesburg stock exchange fell more than 6 percent meanwhile as south africa's financial markets continued to reel under the pressure of asia's tumble and the strengthening us dollar
the rand fell to an all-time low of 4993 to the dollar at one point then strengthened slightly to close at 49885
at the stock exchange the all share index plummeted 394 points _ or 66 percent _ to 559660 much of the plunge was in the industrial index which fell 65 percent
analysts interviewed monday by dow jones said they expected the rand to continue its slide against the dollar due in part to the impact of weaker asian economies on south africa's trade balance
paul marais a director at brokerage barnard jacobs mellet and co said foreign investors were putting the pressure on share prices in south africa
we saw some offshore panic-selling marais said whether it's normal redemptions or they just want to get out of emerging markets we just don't know
south africa has the largest economy on the african continent mainly because of its status as the world's biggest producer of gold platinum and diamonds
but more than 30 percent of the nation's population of almost 40 million are without work and many live in extreme poverty as a legacy of apartheid discrimination
president nelson mandela's government which came to power in 1994 wants to create jobs by developing a stronger industrial sector to produce more finished goods from south africa's abundant raw materials
un officials are proposing that the world body double the value of iraq's oil sales under the oil-for-food program a un spokesman said monday
if the un security council approves the move iraq will be pumping about 16 million barrels per day by february said dennis halliday the un relief coordinator in iraq
any extra pumping by iraq would add downward pressure on world oil prices which have been sliding in recent weeks because of perceptions of ample supplies in november the organization of petroleum exporting countries agreed to boost its production by about 10 percent
halliday told the associated press that un and iraqi experts were reviewing the current program which allows the sale of dlrs 2 billion worth of oil every six months to enable the government to buy food medicine and other humanitarian supplies for its 22 million people
he said among the recommendations due to be finalized this week was a proposal for the un security council to take a decision which will increase iraqi revenues by 100 percent or even more
the recommendation was to implement such an increase during the current six-month phase of the program the third since it began in december 1996 halliday said
he said the oil-for-food arrangement has done very little to alleviate the suffering of the iraqis under the sweeping un trade sanctions imposed after iraq's 1990 invasion of kuwait
the united nations he said would like to boost iraqis food rations by adding cheese and full cream powder milk to their diet the extra money was also needed to rehabilitate water purification facilities and to repair electricity plants
iraq says more than 2 million of its people are without electricity and three- to four-hour blackouts even in the capital baghdad may occur up to four times a day
halliday said other sectors in need of urgent repair included education agriculture and poultry industries
he said he would be forwarding the recommendations to un secretary-general kofi annan who is expected to put them before the security council at the end of january
oil minister amer mohammed rashid said last week iraq would consider jan 8 as the starting date for the program's third phase and that it intended to pump 800000 barrels per day to meet its dlrs 2 billion quota in six months
oil analysts here say iraq would find no difficulty in meeting a new bigger quota the country has the capacity to export more than 2 million barrels a day well above the 16 million barrels a day envisaged by the un recommendation
the exact volume of iraqi exports would be determined by prices on the international market lower prices would mean more oil was exported
meanwhile an iraqi oil official said monday that his government has signed its first contracts under the program's third phase
the official speaking on condition of anonymity said the french oil companies elf aquitaine and total would be the first to take the kirkuk sour grade of crude from the southern turkish terminal of ceyhan later this week

kuala lumpur sun - a trader reported missing from his house in segambut on dec 30 was found drowned in sungai klang eight days ago
passers-by found the partly decomposed body of k thavachelvan pillay 36 floating in the catchment area of the river near teluk pulai in klang on jan 3 at 245pm
police had sent the body to the tengku ampuan rahimah hospital in klang for post-mortem which revealed that pillay had died of drowning
last week his widow v malliga 32 had told a press conference that her husband who suffered from depression had left their home in a white nissan vannette to buy cigarettes at a shop but never came back
later that day malliga's sister-in-law telephoned her saying that she had found pillay's ring driving licence and about rm30 in a flower pot at the entrance to her sister-in-law's house in klang
malliga a mother of two then lodged a report with the jinjang police station on dec 30
this morning pillay's brother-in-law s kathiresan said the van the deceased had driven had been found at a parking lot of the klang municipal council yesterday
he was speaking at a press conference at the mca public services and complaints bureau in wisma mca at jalan ampang
also present was the bureau's chief michael chong
malliga said pillay who had sold cookies at the sri maha mariamman temple in jalan tun hs lee for the past 20 years had been seeking psychiatric treatment at the kuala lumpur hospital since a decade ago
michelle kwan tara lipinski and todd eldredge flashed what looked like olympic medal-winning form at the us championships now the top europeans get their chance to impress
philippe candeloro vlacheslav zagorodniuk irina slutskaya and others are looking to the european figure skating championships for the kind of boost their american rivals picked up last week
competition opens tuesday with the ice dancing compulsories in the morning and the pairs short program at night the men's short program is wednesday while the women get underway friday
kwan and co sparkled at last week's us nationals bringing predictions of a big medal haul for the americans at next month's winter olympics in nagano japan kwan was especially impressive receiving a record eight perfect 60s in her long program
the spotlight now falls on the europeans
while some nations have already selected their teams _ notably france with candeloro a legitimate medal contender _ many will do so based on results this week
there's hot competition among the powerful russian men where alexei urmanov may be forced to abdicate his 1994 olympic title urmanov who is also the defending european champion has been out since the world championships in march with a nagging groin injury
because he pulled out after the short program at the worlds russia gets just two olympic spots instead of three
urmanov must be considered a real longshot for nagano leaving three countrymen in the running ilia kulik 1995 world junior champion alexei yagudin and yevgeny plushenko
kulik served notice he's one to watch by upsetting world champion elvis stojko of canada and eldredge at the champions series final in munich germany last month
but the russian the 1995 european champion withdrew last week citing a nagging back injury while if fit he could still get picked for nagano kulik's absence gives the others particularly yagudin an edge
candeloro second to urmanov last year and ukraine's zagorodnik the 1996 champion and third in 1997 figure to battle the russians for medals here
among the women russia's slutskaya goes for a third straight european title her task will be easier without having to face france's laetitia hubert another injury withdrawal
hubert upset world champion lipinski at the lalique trophy in november and will be on the olympic team hubert's spot here was taken by surya bonaly the european champion from 1991-95 bonaly's stock has fallen considerably since then she was ninth at the 1997 europeans
slutskaya will be pushed by maria butyrskaya the russian champion four years running german champion tanja szewczenko and hungary's krisztina czako the 1997 european silver medalist
szewczenko 20 has made a remarkable return from an 18-month hiatus with a viral illness she won the nhk trophy in november and was a close second to lipinski at munich
whereas slutskaya became the first russian to win a women's european skating title in 1996 russians and the soviet union have owned olympic pairs and ice dancing for years pasha grishuk and yevgeny platov _ the reigning olympic world and european ice dancing champions _ are worthy heirs to that tradition
they are likely to extend their remarkable 20-competition victory streak in milan provided grishuk recovers from a freak accident in practice here sunday grishuk who recently changed her name from oksana to pasha to avoid confusion with 1994 olympic champion oksana baiul collided with countrywoman anzhelika krylova and suffered a cut on her right elbow
a muscle was hit it is a bit painful but nothing serious grishuk said
the pairs competition is missing world champions mandy wotzel and ingo steuer the germans second last year aren't competing because steuer is not yet fully recovered from a traffic accident in december
marina yeltsova and andrei buehkov defend their title while fellow russians elena berezhnaya and anton sikharulidze first at the champions series final european bronze in 1997 will challenge the third russian couple oksana kazakova and artur dmitriev is also strong dmitriev 29 won european world and olympic golds with former partner natalia mishkutienok
three candidates filed to run for the slovak presidency prior to monday's deadline parliamentary spokeswoman anna zatkova said
however none of the three is supported by the largest political party premier vladimir meciar's movement for a democratic slovakia no one is likely to be elected when parliament holds a first round of voting on jan 23
the three are stefan markus who was nominated by the slovak democratic coalition which is opposed to meciar juraj hrasko who was nominated by reformed communists and augustin kurek nominated by a single parliamentary deputy who has split off from a junior party in meciar's coalition
the election is aimed at electing a successor to michal kovac an opponent of meciar kovac has seen meciar steadily whittle away his power and says he does not want another five-year term
if no president is elected more power could land in meciar's hands
meciar's movement for a democratic slovakia is the largest in parliament with 61 of 150 seats that still is far short of the three-fifths or 90 votes needed in parliament to elect a president representatives of meciar's party have said repeatedly they were not planning to support any candidate in the first round
there may be any number of rounds of voting for president and candidates who fail in one round do not qualify to run in the subsequent rounds

banks will focus on consolidating branches and expanding fee income in response to rising costs and higher interest rates brought about by the asian financial crisis
it is becoming very expensive to maintain branches what we'll do is to consolidate our branches by relocating or converting existing branches to suit specific locations bank of america asia director and executive vice-president in charge of branch banking charles ma said
for example if a location is suitable for both commercial and retail banking it will convert its existing retail banking branch in the area into a commercial branch he said
there are also some locations which are only suitable for retail banking or servicing such as sha tin or telford garden
he said the general trend in branch banking this year is for banks not to expand the number of existing branches but to make each branch more efficient
bank of america asia has 17 branches and is scheduled to open a new one in yuen long in march _ the only one to be opened this year he said
on the trend towards fee-based income mr ma said we will emphasise fee-based services such as insurance investment services like mutual funds foreign exchange margin trading securities services and mortgages in a late bid to get a foothold in an already highly competitive market the bank introduced preferred banking _ a relationship-driven product aimed at customers with at least $1 million _ two months ago
the product's launch came during the midst of the asian financial turmoil that has prompted rising interest rates and gloomy prospects for local banks a bank analyst said
preferred banking is designed to boost fee income for the bank from collateral businesses from high-value customers mr ma said
preferred banking customers would enjoy higher interest rate on deposits and additional services like the use of a safety deposit box and discounts on bank drafts remittances mutual funds securities trading and preferential pricing on foreign exchange trading
mr ma said preferred banking has already attracted 100 customers at its branch in central
the bank will be opening more preferred banking centres in its branches including the new one to be opened in yuen long he said
the target is to attract about 1000 preferred banking accounts within the year mr ma said
french authorities detected a new case of mad cow disease and as a result detroyed a herd of 135 cows in the normandy region over the weekend the agriculture ministry said monday
it was the first case in 1998 and the 32nd all together in france of the disease the ministry said in a statement six cases were detected last year among france's 21 million cows
killing the herd allows french authorities to determine whether other cows were affected and to avoid any risk of transmitting the disease to humans
a ban on british beef imports to france and other members of the european union was put in place last year after a potential link was established between mad cow disease _ also known as bovine spongiform encephalopathy _ and a fatal human ailment called creutzfeldt-jakob disease

a large rival telecommunications company has been blamed for the collapse of a proposed investment in and rescue by a mainland consortium of hong kong-based china entertainment television broadcast ltd cetv
a cetv source have claimed the rival firm which operates in different parts of the region had used its powerful guanxi in beijing to pressure the mainland companies from backing the cetv deal
but a representative of the rival firm denied he or his company had anything to do with the deal being called off
we have nothing to do with the deal we have never spoken to any mainland officials about cetv he said
cetv recently said its no sex no violence television station controlled by the husband-wife duo of robert and peggy chua faces closure after mainland investors reneged on a us$34 million hk$2652 million investment deal
mr chua earlier said the station needs us$1 million as monthly expenses plus a white knight to keep it working or he would be forced to pull down the shutters at the end of this month if he fails to find a buyer
the hong kong standard has obtained a copy of a fax sent by an executive of the rival firm to gerry tyrnon chief executive of cetv stating his colleagues had informed him that mr chua had been very active in attempting to lobby against the rival firm in the mainland
understandably he is somewhat aggrieved over phoenix's apparent breakthrough in guangdong
these remain unsubstantiated reports but if they prove correct and robert feels it necessary to go about badmouthing the company and making trouble we will not step back from a fight the fax said
the fax went on to say that if cetv failed to play by gentleman's rules we too can flex some guanxi muscles
the spokesman for cetv's rival firm said the letter related to a matter different from the mainland consortium's plan to invest in cetv

eleven carriers have agreed to appoint cathay pacific's customer airlines ca section as their ground handling agent at chek lap kok
new airport general manager victor ho said he hopes to firm up more deals in the coming year
mr ho admitted there are some challenges ahead
more airline handling agents and facilities in chek lap kok give airlines more options in choosing handling agents or to self-handle he said adding that ca not only gives cathay reasonable returns but also maintains its exposure in the market
we can strengthen our leverage power when negotiating with our ground handling agent overseas and also make use of synergies and economies of scale in terms of resources and equipment he said
the 11 airlines already committed are aeroflot russian airlines transaero airlines singapore airlines royal air nepal malaysia airlines all nippon airways air canada nippon cargo airlines air hong kong vietnam airlines and thai airways
ca manager jon conway said the airlines represent more than half the current volume of business cathay is handling at kai tak
cathay is still negotiating with other prospective customers including grandair ansett australia alitalia biman bangladesh airlines klm lufthansa air mauritius philippine airlines air niugini and swissair
on the down side cathay suffered in the japanese market last year and projections for the first few months of this year make it clear there is still a big fight ahead
marketing and sales manager for japan greg hughes said obviously we can't do anything about exchange rates or the economy but out of these challenges come small successes and the focus will be getting back to basics he said this year's marketing action plan has several main objectives including revitalisation of the home market
we have to move forward and work towards success in the summer months mr hughes said

tung fong hung properties holdings on sunday announced it had sold 11 properties for $293 million in a bid to reduce its overall debt
tung fong hung properties derived monthly rental income of about $07 million from these properties company secretary cheung lin shun said the firm is also exchanging some of its properties with an independent party in a transaction worth $89 million
the book value for the properties sold and exchanged interests was about $443 million
tung fong hung properties is expected to report a loss of about $106 million on the sale and the exchange mr cheung said
the losses will be included in the accounts of tung fong hung properties for the year ending march 1998

iraq announced monday it would block any arms inspections by a team led american scott ritter a move that could set off a new confrontation with un weapons inspectors
the announcement was made on the state-run iraqi news agency which quoted an official spokesman who said the presence of too many american inspectors was prolonging the inspections program and delaying removal of curbs on iraq's oil exports
the agency's report came after ritter and a team of un inspectors made a visit monday to iraqi government buildings near the headquarters of the un special commission which is responsible for the weapons inspection program
apparently the team was not blocked since the agency's report said the ban on ritter would begin jan 13 tuesday ritter was heavily involved in the inspections of sensitive sites that led to last october's standoff between iraq and the weapons inspectors
the iraqi agency quoted the government spokesman as saying ritter's team included too many americans and britons adding the team will not be allowed to carry out inspections unless it is reformed in a balanced manner
the official who was not identified by the agency said the team included nine americans five britons a russian and an australian
this shows striking evidence of the imbalance in the composition of the team and its methods of action in iraq the spokesman said
an iraqi official said government buildings visited by ritter's team monday included a hospital and prison in baghdad
in new york ewen buchanan a spokesman for the un inspection teams said the united nations had not been informed officially of the iraqi decision to block inspections led by ritter
we're trying to find out what this means buchanan said
ritter was severely criticized by iraq at the time that it blocked american weapons inspectors from working in iraq last october which led to a three-week break in the weapons inspections
the iraqi spokesman also accused american weapons inspectors of carrying out activities detrimental to iraq's national interest
they have been falsifying facts inventing lies deliberately prolonging the process and sending false reports to the security council the agency quoted him as saying
the continuation of this situation is unacceptable he added repeating charges that americans dominate the weapons inspections program at un headquarters
the latest row comes just a week before a scheduled visit to iraq by un chief inspector richard butler an australian to solve outstanding issues related to access to sensitive sites like presidential palaces
during last fall's confrontation iraq accused american inspectors of spying on iraq and helping plan for us attacks on the country un officials denied the charges and pulled all weapons inspectors out of the country the impasse was ended with russian mediation
the inspectors' job is to certify that iraq has fulfilled its obligation under un resolutions to eliminate its weapons of mass destruction
sanctions imposed on iraq following its 1990 invasion of neighboring kuwait _ which include a ban on the export of oil _ cannot be lifted until the un security council accepts that iraqi weapons programs have been halted
iraq maintains it has fulfilled the requirements under security council resolutions but the weapons inspectors have repeatedly accused the government of president saddam hussein of hiding weapons and the means to manufacture them
ritter has been involved in so-called concealment investigations in which inspectors seek to find materials believed hidden by the iraqis such inspections have been a source of friction especially since they deal with sensitive sites such as saddam's palaces
in june iraq accused ritter of spying for the the cia ritter a former marine major who has been an inspector for six years denied the charges
it is absolutely untrue i have never been employed or affiliated with the cia ritter said i find it disturbing and even insulting that iraqi authorities with whom i have worked in the past six years would undertake such tactics lb-ggl
prime minister benjamin netanyahu survived a no-confidence vote that ended in a tie monday embarrassing but not toppling the israeli leader
the coalition mustered a 54-54 vote with two members in the 120-seat parliament abstaining
the vote was the first since the david levy resigned as foreign minister last week reducing the size of the ruling coalition from 66 to 61 in the 120-member knesset four of the five members of levy's gesher faction voted with the opposition
in addition three coalition legislators are abroad and three likud rebels _ former cabinet ministers dan meridor and benny begin as well as legislator david reem _ absented themselves to show their displeasure over netanyahu's policies
opposition member salah tarif was absent had he been present the opposition would have won a majority but even that would have been insufficient because under a new law an absolute majority of 61 lawmakers is needed to topple the ruling coalition
the motion of no confidence was introduced by the opposition labor and meretz parties over what they said was netanyahu's failed social and economic policies
a police officer was among six suspects arrested monday for the slaying of six men aboard a passenger bus last month
widespread allegations of police cooperation with the underworld have rocked this nation since late 1996 when a traffic accident revealed intricate ties between mafia hitmen police chiefs and politicians
parliament lifted the immunities of a former interior minister and another deputy so they could be tries on charges of masterminding such cooperation
last month's execution-style killing near edirne on the greek border appeared to have been carried out under a drug lord's orders according to the police the official anatolia news agency reported
the drug lord had suspected the six victims of plotting against him according to initial police investigation
one of the suspects was an active duty police officer and another was an officer who recently left the police special forces anatolia said that unit has been accused of involvement in slayings and drug smuggling

the stock market finished its full trading week of 1998 on a disappointing note as the region continued to linger with debt and confidence problems
renewed fear of the further collapse of japanese financial houses repayment capabilities for short-term debts and banking failures caused a further flight of capital from the ringgit and other regional currencies
these factors collectively pushed for unwarranted demand for the greenback by investors and impacted a lower closing on most asian bourses and higher prime interest rates intervention by bank negara at various levels failed to contain the ringgit movement as it was well bid by corporate demand forward hedging and panicked covering causing it to fall against the greenback to unprecedented lows
the optimistic budget by indonesia and political future of president suharto did not favour foreign investor's sentiment causing the rupiah to fall by more than 60 per cent for the week however intervention by concerned parties helped the rupiah and other regional currencies to recover on the last trading day of the week
kuala lumpur stock exchange composite index continued its bearish trend mainly on the ringgit slide it was opened at 57167 on monday and closed at 49160 on friday throughout the week the futures market was traded mostly at a discount to par as players were still cautious and bearish
the january 98 contract was actively traded with a total volume of 9983 for the week with a range between a low of 46610 on friday and a high of 55600 on monday
while regional sentiments remain bearish we believe the reaction to the currency weakness was over reacted the possibility of moratorium on indonesian debt may trigger another round of selling the futures market is expected to trade at a discount as sentiments remained bearish given the weak market sentiment the klci is expected to consolidate further it is expected to trade between 454 and 537 levels
egypt and sudan are making great progress in normalizing relations but it is too early for an egyptian-sudanese summit a junior sudanese cabinet minister said monday
speaking after talks with egyptian foreign minister amr moussa sudan's minister of state for foreign affairs mustafa osman ismail told reporters the two states were making headway in settling their disputes over security and river transportation issues
but ismail retreated from his jan 2 forecast that sudanese president gen omar el-bashir would visit cairo soon
we are not in a hurry to jump to this step el-bashir's visit but it will happen he said
however ismail was upbeat about the direction of sudan's talks with egypt
we feel there is great progress in the relations between the two people and we are making a great effort to fully normalize bilateral issues ismail said
relations between egypt and sudan have been strained since 1989 when el-bashir took power in a military coup and installed an islamic regime
they reached their lowest point in 1995 when egypt accused sudan of sheltering gunmen involved in an assassination attempt against president hosni mubarak in addis ababa ethiopia mubarak was not hurt in the attack
sudan denied the allegations
mubarak and el-bashir last met in cairo in 1996 on the sidelines of an arab league summit nothing came of the meeting but recent weeks have seen conciliatory remarks from both sides
egypt has also accused sudan of supporting muslim militants who have waged an insurrection since 1992 to overthrow its secular government and install strict islamic rule sudan has denied the charge mae-eap-jbm
prime minister benjamin netanyahu's parliamentary coalition managed only a tie against an opposition no-confidence vote monday reflecting the government's precarious political situation
former foreign minister david levy voted with the opposition as did four of the five members of his gesher faction cementing their break with the coalition after levy resigned last week
the 54-54 tie in the 120-seat parliament fell short of the absolute majority of 61 needed to topple the government
but it underscored netanyahu's extremely difficult situation eight days before he is to meet president clinton who expects a concrete offer on israel's long-delayed west bank troop pullback
in his speech to the knesset centrist lawmaker yehuda harel said his third way party's continued support for netanyahu was conditional of implementation of the pullback promised in the israel-plo accords
but a group of over 15 rightist legislators are threatening to bolt netanyahu's coalition if the pullback goes through
the situation leaves netanyahu with little maneuvering room noting opposition lawmaker yossi beilin
netanyahu won't be able to continue his term in the coming months beilin said he will have to resign or be toppled we are preparing ourselves for next elections
many israeli commentators believe netanyahu's goal is to gain time in hopes circumstances will somehow change
an emerging strategy appears geared toward this officials suggest the cabinet will decide on the pullout but on condition the palestinians fulfil a series of demands _ and only implement the decision after another vote in several months if they comply
the question is whether this will satisfy all the parties involved the palestinians the americans coalition centrists and coalition rightists
still netanyahu's reputation as a skilled political operator remains intact for the moment he has weathered last week's dramatic resignation of levy who accused the government of abandoning the peace process and pursuing ruinous social policy
monday's no-confidence motion was introduced by the opposition labor and meretz parties over what they said was netanyahu's failed social and economic policy
three coalition legislators were abroad and three likud rebels _ former cabinet ministers dan meridor and benny begin as well as legislator david reem _ absented themselves to show their displeasure with netanyahu
levy told israel tv that netanyahu shamelessly broke an agreement with him on welfare issues and therefore gesher is free to vote as we see fit and according to our conscience dp
swiss firm lindt and spruengli announced monday it is acquiring ghirardelli chocolate co of san francisco

the acquisition adds around dlrs 100 million to lindt's global sales which in 1997 rose 51 percent on the previous year to 102 billion swiss francs dlrs 705 million
ghirardelli founded in 1852 has some 500 employees it has retail outlets in san francisco chicago las vegas and florida's disney world
the belgian soccer federation complained monday that fifa has offered it far too few tickets for its world cup games while scalpers are calling in with offers of thousands of seats at hugely inflated prices
it's almost hopeless there is just no way to give the ordinary fan a ticket said jan peeters secretary general of the belgian federation
our best fans will miss it all
belgium was offered just 5400 seats at the 80000-capacity stade de france in saint-denis for its opening game against the netherlands on june 13
the federation has already had 120000 requests for seats from belgian fans eager to see the game against traditional rivals in a stadium just 85 minutes away from brussels by train
peeters already called fifa on friday to complain and was writing an official letter monday he also plans a joint protest with the netherlands who also were offered a limited amount of tickets
belgium is expected to get some 3000 tickets for its second first-round game against mexico in bordeaux on june 20 and 4000 for its last group game against south korea on june 25 in paris
at the same time scalpers are already calling federation headquarters offering thousands of tickets at over six times the official rate peeters said tickets were offered at 9400 francs dlrs 250 while the official rate was 1500 francs dlrs 40
it's proof the ticket system doesn't work this is wrong peeters said
most tickets for the 64 games have already been allocated and the chase for the remaining seats is hot the host nation is getting some two thirds of ticket sales and peeters feared many of those ended up on the parallel black market
this can have a lot of repercussions on security in the stadiums he said seats allocated to different federations are segregated but ticket sales on the black market could create a volatile mix of fans in the stands
us-based motorola inc and german electronics giant siemens ag announced a 15 billion mark dlrs 830 million joint venture to develop a cheaper computer chip monday
the project in dresden the former center of computer production for east germany and much of the rest of the soviet bloc is expected to create thousands of new jobs in the now-depressed region about one in five germans in the east are unemployed about twice the rate in the west
siemens board chairman heinrich von pierer said he expected the project to cost 15 billion marks with 1 billion marks alone going for research and development
germany will provide up to 187 million marks dlrs 104 million in subsidies for research while the state of saxony is putting up 120 million marks dlrs 67 million for construction
the dresden plant will be able to make microprocessor chips from larger silicon wafers thus getting more from each sheet and cutting costs by about 30 percent pierer said at a bonn news conference production is expected to begin around 2000
also at the bonn news conference research minister juergen ruettgers said wacker siltronic of burghausen in bavaria would build a silicon plant to supply the dresden plant with 300 millimeter wafers
that project will receive 63 million marks dlrs 35 million in federal subsidies and is expected to produce 2000 new jobs pfg-tc
officials on monday denied a newspaper report that france provided arms to the hutu-led government of rwanda during the 1994 genocide of ethnic tutsis
the respected conservative daily le figaro reported monday that the government continued to send weapons to the hutus even after paris voted for a un arms embargo
france persevered in its policy of cooperation with the the rwandan regime with those who made the genocide possible le figaro said
that cooperation it said continued at least until the end of may 1994 nearly two months after the genocide began
the foreign ministry on monday denied the report in the most categoric fashion _ as it did in november 1996 after a similar report by britain's channel four
french authorities did not approve any arms shipments after the peace accords of august 4 1993 ministry spokesman yves doutriaux told a daily news briefing monday
the presidential palace declined to comment
le figaro quoted a high military official in france as saying he gave the order to halt the shipments one month before operation turquoise france's peacekeeping mission to rwanda that began june 23 1994
the paper contended that then-socialist president francois mitterrand maintained the policy in order to block expanding american interests in french-speaking central africa conservative prime minister edouard balladur backed the approach le figaro said
an estimated 500000 people most of them tutsi civilians were slaughtered in the civil war that toppled the hutu-led government in july 1994
le figaro said that a plane flew may 3 with weapons worth dlrs 942680 for the rwandan armed forces the plane landed in zaire now congo for delivery to the rwandans
the company dyl-invest spent dlrs 450000 for the shipping with the balance of dlrs 130000 paid by the rwandan embassy in cairo le figaro said
it said the company was based in the french alpine town of cran-gevrier the company however was not listed in the telephone directory
also in early may le figaro said the french weapons company sofremas confirmed an order of arms worth dlrs 8028000 by the rwandan embassy in paris
in a letter dated may 6 1994 sofremas said the order was for the immediate delivery by air upon reception of 30 percent of the total to our bank account le figaro reported
le figaro did not say how much of the order was filled the defense ministry said monday that the company a state firm that linked french suppliers with foreign buyers no longer exists
despite french assurances of no weapons deliveries to goma the congo border town with rwanda le figaro reported a july 18 french flight there carrying dlrs 753645 in arms
the last flight was documented in a letter by lt col kayumba cyprien charge daffaires at the rwandan embassy during the genocide le figaro said

kuala terengganu sat - the state-level national economic action council which was set up last month has succeeded in reducing the electricity bill at wisma darul iman by rm21000

menteri besar tan sri wan mokhtar ahmad said the state-level neac would be introducing more measures to further reduce expenditure including reducing wastage of stationery especially paper
we are also thinking of setting a limit for medical bills we want to encourage those with minor ailments to seek treatment at government hospitals and clinics he said today
he said the medical bills of government employees came up to about rm25000 a month
the terengganu neac is headed by wan mokhtar and represented by senior government officials

former us army sgt 1st class clyde lee conrad convicted of treason in 1990 for leaking nato and american secrets to the soviet bloc died in the german prison where he was serving a life sentence he was 50
prosecutors in koblenz confirmed monday that conrad died last thursday apparently from heart failure an autopsy has been ordered the statement said
conrad was convicted on june 6 1990 of masterminding an espionage ring that sold highly sensitive information to hungarian and czechoslovakian intelligence agents from 1975 through 1985 when he retired after 20 years in the military
prosecutors said the documents _ about troop maneuvers nato strategy and nuclear weapons sites _ eventually found their way to the soviet kgb
the german court found he had compromised the west's entire defense capability in exchange for an estimated dlrs 12 million
because conrad had retired in then-west germany with his german wife and son he had to be prosecuted by german authorities
a native of sebring ohio conrad had been in charge of the classified document center at the army's 8th infantry division in bad kreuznach 50 miles 80 kilometers west of frankfurt
according to court records conrad was introduced to the hungarian secret service in late autumn 1975 by his supervisor in the 8th infantry division former us army sgt 1st class zoltan szabo
szabo who was convicted of espionage in austria in 1989 received a 10-month suspended sentence he identified for investigators some of the documents the court said conrad sold to the hungarians
two hungarians sandor kercsik and his brother imre were described by the court as conrad's main contacts they were arrested in 1988 in sweden and were sentenced to 18 months in prison for possessing nato defense material
the kercsik brothers also provided statements implicating conrad who was arrested aug 23 1988 pfg-tc
after weeks of escalating tensions between russia and chechnya moscow sounded a conciliatory note monday and stressed the need for economic cooperation with the breakaway southern republic
the russian government has been sending mixed signals about its policy toward chechnya in recent days one hardliner called last week for pre-emptive strikes against chechen bandits while moderates are emphasizing the need for compromise
boris agapov the deputy secretary of russia's security council said monday that moscow should work to improve the economy in the region or risk a worsening of the situation the itar-tass news agency reported
president boris yeltsin wants to visit chechnya where he is widely reviled for launching the 1994-96 war that ultimately failed to crush the chechen separatists
yeltsin's spokesman sergei yastrzhembsky said chechnya remained too volatile for the president to travel there but he added that doesn't relieve federal officials from the task of seeking the most flexible and effective ways to normalize the situation
monday's comments contrasted with the hostile rhetoric between the two sides in recent weeks despite a peace treaty last may the russian-chechen relationship is still filled with friction
a russian delegation led by deputy prime minister ramazan abdulatipov traveled to chechnya over the weekend in a bid to ease tensions abdulatipov said the two sides agreed on joint measures for financing restoration of the war-shattered economy
in chechnya meanwhile acting prime minister shamil basayev has completed his selection of a new government which will officially be announced on tuesday the interfax news agency reported
chechnya's president aslan maskhadov asked basayev to form a government in hopes of bringing greater order and stability to chechnya which is still plagued by armed gangs and frequent kidnappings
basayev was a leading field commander in the war with russia and many chechens regard him as a hero but russia considers him a terrorist for leading a 1995 hostage-taking raid in southern russia that left more than 100 people dead many of them civilians
basayev's new government might pose a problem for moscow most russian officials have avoided direct dealings with basayev who remains an outspoken critic of moscow
the russia-chechnya peace deal has not resolved the all-important question of chechnya's political status chechnya runs its own affairs and considers itself independent but moscow insists the territory is still part of russia
a group of militant soccer fans suspected of organizing violent clashes with rival hooligans will be charged with membership in an organized crime gang authorities said monday
the 14 ajax amsterdam partisans will appear in court in early march said stijna den haan of the city's public prosecutor's office
the fans organized fights by using mobile telephones and the internet authorities said and they are suspected of selling drugs and possessing illegal weapons they could be sentenced to up to five years in prison if convicted
prosecutors believe the ajax supporters who were arrested in police sweeps last september and november are part of the amsterdam club's so-called hard core of fans notorious for their violent behavior
an ajax supporter was beaten and stabbed to death last march in a brawl with fans of archrival feyenoord rotterdam the brawlers arranged the fight in advance to avoid police sent to control crowds at soccer fields
dutch interior minister hans dijkstal condemned the violence and said the participants should be punished to the full extent of the law
two feyenoord fans were convicted last september of homicide in the ajax fan's death and were jailed for four years
a german terror suspect was driven by hatred of jews when he plotted to carry out a suicide bombing in israel with the help of islamic militants court papers released monday quoted an associate as telling investigators
the suspect stephan josef smyrek 26 from the german town of braunschweig was arrested after arriving in israel in november and on monday was ordered held until the end of his trial
no trial date has been set
the pre-trial hearings in the tel aviv district court have been held behind closed doors and much of the case against smyrek has been under a gag order
however the court on monday released five pages of a 12-page document that included statements smyrek made to israeli interrogators and information provided by german police
he wanted to blow himself up a friend of smyrek's was quoted as telling german police her name was stricken from the copies of the document given to reporters
he told me he wanted to strap grenades or a bomb to his stomach in order to blow himself uphe spoke often of his hatred for jews the woman was quoted as saying
smyrek is accused of conspiring to carry out an attack in israel harming state security and membership in a terror organization _ the iranian-backed hezbollah group which is trying to drive israeli troops out of southern lebanon
each charge carries a maximum sentence of life imprisonment
smyrek's lawyer dan assan said his client's confession to the shin bet security service was extracted by force and that he planned to contest it
assan said the state's case was weak and his client plans to plead innocent
i don't believe there is enough evidence of an act of conspiracy with hezbollah and no evidence of the planning of a suicide bombing attack in the foreseeable future assan told the associated press
the court based its decision to hold smyrek mostly on the confession and evidence provided by the german police
i decide to give my live and blood to allah to carry out the act of martyrdom smyrek told israeli interrogators on nov 29 a day after his arrest according to the court documents
smyrek born a catholic converted to islam in 1994
a lebanese resident of germany who was not further identified told the authorities that smyrek contacted several arabs in germany to help with his recruitment into hezbollah
smyrek said he also made contact with a palestinian from the west bank city of hebron who told smyrek he could become a suicide bomber for the islamic militant group hamas which is based in the west bank and gaza strip hamas has carried out more than a dozen suicide bombings in israel since 1994
smyrek told interrogators he was interested in hamas but for one reason or another lost contact
smyrek who was carrying a video camera a map of israel and dlrs 4000 at the time of his arrest told interrogators that his mission was to gather information and take it back to lebanon to the hezbollah
they didn't tell me that my mission was martyrdom and they didn't tell me for security reasons and it appears that they planned to tell me only shortly before i was to carry out the shihada he said using the arabic word martyrdom

kota kinabalu sat - the high court was today told there was evidence to show that chief minister datuk yong teck lee and two other ministers had conspired to destroy the career and livelihood of former forestry department acting director awang tengah awang amin
lawyer sugumar balakrishnan said yong along with deputy chief minister datuk ghapur salleh and agriculture and fisheries minister datuk pandikar amin mulia had conspired to destroy the livelihood of a public servant who had carried out his duties according to law
awang tengah is suing the state public service commission and the state government for his alleged wrongful removal as acting director on aug 15 last year
sugumar said yong had betrayed the people of sabah and their future generations when he signed away two million hectares of forest reserves to certain private companies without proper and fair criteria
he said when awang tengah objected to this he was removed from office
sugumar said one of the defence witnesses state secretary datuk khalil datu jamalul had usurped the constitutional powers of the public service commission when he issued the transfer order last march
senior state counsel juprin wong-adamal representing the psc and the state government submitted that the policy to have forest management units licensed out for sustainable forest management was decided by the state cabinet and that the state government had no alternative but to do so
justice richard malanjum said that he would deliver his reserved judgement based on submissions in about a month

harvard you don't want to push these countries into severe recession according to joseph stiglitz who adds one ought to focus on things that caused the crisis not on things that make it more difficult to deal with
but that is exactly what the programmes designed and prescribed by the international monetary fund imf are doing to east asia the exchange rates are out of line with anything that economic fundamentals would dictate confidence in the economies is being eroded and recession is being induced leading to massive layoffs and unemployment
stiglitz according to the wall street journal describes the situation in east asia as crises in confidence he is the chief economist at the world bank and was formerly president clinton's top economist
he however is not the first to criticise the imf package for east asian economies - south korea thailand and indonesia - and its handling of the crisis in general
while jeffery sachs of harvard institute for international development hiid has been critical of the imf and the clinton administration's approach to the asian crisis from the very beginning he now has company with more articulating their views
they point to the fact that the remedies prescribed have not worked but have in fact been counter-productive and may result in a deeper than needed recession
mr barton briggs chairman of morgan stanley asset management says
we should pressure the imf to foresake its tough love' fiscal and monetary austerity remedies for asia instead the imf should implement programmes that enable asian countries to grow out of harm's way
mr steve forbes chairman of americans for hope growth and opportunity wrote in the wall street journal that the clinton-gore administration and the imf are prescribing remedies based on a bogus theory
forbes adds that devaluations are disaster and argues that they trigger enormous domestic inflation sharply reduce people's standard of living hobble domestic capital creation scare away foreign investment he urges the us to tell the imf officials to take a hike
the remedies for east asia are those which were prescribed to latin america during the debt crisis but the story here is different in south-east asia - malaysia indonesia the philippines and thailand - all have been running budget surpluses inflation has been low and foreign exchange reserves until july last year had been rising
the story in latin america was the opposite - the economies had run up huge budget deficits economies were overheated and inflation was very high in contrast the asian economies have low inflation high savings and relatively low deficits
the imf's standard remedy - higher interest rates less government spending higher taxes slower growth - are causing the countries to go into deeper problems including rising unemployment thailand and south korea are trying to persuade the fund to ease the fiscal requirements to date the imf programmes have not shown results but the washington- based organisation nevertheless continues to press on with its remedies which are making the patient even more ill
according to a study by the heritage foundation of the 89 developing countries that have received help from the fund since 1965 more than half are no better off than they were before and 32 are worse off
sachs points out that imf remedies in east asia are leading to profound credit squeeze causing a massive reduction of production and not restoring confidence he points out that the only thing the imf programmes are doing now is getting money to the banks so that they come out clean while these economies get squeezed to a remarkable extent
the wall street journal notes that the imf's prescription of lower government spending and higher taxes to offset the costs of restructuring banks is the opposite to the advice it gives to japan which is told to widen deficits to clean up its banks and is the opposite of what the us did during the savings and loan rescue in 1987 with the stock market crash the federal reserve poured in money so that no large institution would go bust
yet in thailand indonesia and south korea the imf and the us are pressuring the closure of banking institutions according to robert kuttner co-editor of the american prospect orthodox economists seem eager to commend a strategy of letting markets purge failures only when harm falls on other people
stiglitz notes that virtually every american economist rejects the balanced budget principle during a recession and asks why should we ignore this when giving advice to other countries
this however is not the first time nor will it be the last that the us has in the name of the imf taken a stand of do as i say not as i do

batu pahat sat - human resources minister datuk lim ah lek said that action would be taken against employers who laid off workers without paying wages and compensation
he said retrenching workers arbitrarily was an offence under the employment act 1995 with offenders liable to fines of between rm2000 and rm10000
speaking to reporters after a fund-raising dinner for the cheng siu primary school last night lim said the ministry had not come across any employer who had committed such an act
he said the ministry had investigated reports that a factory in kuantan had laid off workers without paying them wages and compensation and found the complaints baseless
in fact all the retrenched workers were paid according to the law and most of them have been absorbed by other manufacturers
on retrenched foreigners in the construction sector lim said they could get jobs in the plantation and manufacturing sectors
but they must first apply to the immigration department to get jobs in the other sectors
he also said the press should not publicise negative reports on the economy adding that these could create panic among the public
he said the frenzied buying of sugar and the withdrawal of savings in local banks for transfer to foreign banks were manifestations of this
shortages of medicine and food hampered china's efforts monday to care for a half million people left injured or homeless by an earthquake that devastated scores of villages in northern china
the destruction from saturday's earthquake in hebei province north of beijing was worse than initially reported although the casualty count held steady _ 50 dead 11440 people injured 1200 of them seriously _ estimates of damage to homes soared as rescue workers reached more communities in the hilly remote region
disaster relief officials in hebei reported that the 62 magnitude quake flattened 103000 houses and a provincial spokesman said another 130000 houses were too damaged to live in the state-run xinhua news agency said some 542000 people had been injured or left homeless by the quake
state television showed people sleeping on straw under thick quilts in large canvas tents with campfires burning outside as nighttime temperatures dropped to minus 20 degrees celsius minus 4 degrees fahrenheit
in many villages yet to receive relief supplies families too scared to return to their cracked or listing mud stone and brick homes slept in haystacks or under makeshift lean-tos
doctors struggled without adequate medicine or medical facilities to treat the injured xinhua said it reported late monday that flu and diarrhea were striking many young and elderly survivors
more food also was needed it cited the civil affairs ministry as saying
despite the shortages state media stressed that survivors' needs were being met xinhua reported that the situation was now stable with large quantities of relief goods on the way china central television on the national evening news broadcast said the quake victims' emotions are steady

regular readers of to the macs may suspect that this week's column is a hoax since it contains a favourable review of a microsoft product for the macintosh microsoft has been putting out garbage software for the mac for so long it's hard to believe that they've finally done something right
but they have
last week i installed a beta version of microsoft office 98 for the macintosh and i'm impressed it reminds me of the old days when microsoft cranked out great mac applications instead of crummy ports from windows
steve jobs sold apple's soul to microsoft in exchange for this program so it better be good it is
requirements microsoft office 98 only runs on a powerpc central processing unit cpu and no 68k version is planned if you haven't upgraded to a powermac yet this may give you a reason as office 98 was rewritten from the ground-up specifically for powerpc all the codes are native so it runs fast even on low-end 603e chips memory and disk requirements are lower than office 42 and you can install and use it on a 16-megabyte mac with 40mb of free hard disk space of course that's cutting it pretty close
the package is much more stable than version 42 and even the beta version i've been using has crashed only a few times this is very different from the old microsoft office which crashed so frequently that i almost got used to it almost
installation to install office 98 all you have to do is drag a folder to your hard disk and launch an application the first time an application is run it installs all the components it needs in the proper locations
better yet office 98 is self-repairing which means it periodically checks to see if all its pieces are in order and re-installs components when necessary this feature is going to be included in future versions of office 98 for windows too but the mac's got it first
self-repairing applications aren't as good as applications that don't break in the first place but this feature should be a big step forward if it works well in the long term
file formats at last mac users can exchange files with personal computer pc users in the latest native ms office file formats microsoft also provides converters to translate older formats of course hypertext markup language is a supported format and you can read from a web page or publish a document to html
on-line help the new on-line help feature seems like a cross between helpful and annoying while you are working in a document a little character who looks like a mac sits off to the side in a special window shouting out hints whenever it thinks you need help it shouts at you by popping up a cartoon speech balloon with a hint that you can click on for more information
a cute idea but i found it distracting in practice of course you can turn it off but every once in a while it pops up again
if you don't like the little mac character you can change it to something else but the choice is limited i'm sure third-parties will take up the slack maybe with tiny images of famous people like mike tyson or pam anderson ugh
word i've been using the new version of word quite a bit so i'll comment on it and leave excel and powerpoint for later i'm even using word to write this column which is the first time to the macs has been written in a microsoft product one of the first things i noticed about the new word is how fast it launched much faster than word 6 and even faster than my text editor of choice bbedit
the look and feel is much improved over word 6 and this version looks like it belongs on a mac instead of windows the font menu is back and displays each font in true what-you-see-is-what-you'll-get wysiwyg style if you choose you can set the toolbar to resemble word 51 but the new toolbars seem fine to me
word can check spelling and grammar while you type much like the office 97 version for windows does spell checking is fast an accurate but grammar checking is too much for me so i turned it off
the table tools are more robust in this version and a draw table feature lets you customise tables with far less fuss also improved are bullets and numbers envelopes and graphics
oh and one truly great feature is multiple undos which let you go back through many layers of edits and restore your changes this is something that nisus writer came out with years ago and it's about time word for the mac caught on
thankfully the new word includes built-in anti-virus detection so i hope this will stop the spread of macro viruses from pcs to macs
this was one of my biggest gripes about word 6 which was the first program to allow the thousands of pc viruses to work on macs
before word 6 mac users hardly even thought about computer viruses
gripes i've found a few things i don't like about office 98 especially those confusing folder tabs in dialogue boxes microsoft uses them in the preferences dialogue box and other places that have lots of options to set but i find them confusing and ugly i prefer the mac-style icon list in a scrolling box on the left like the old control panel used
another gripe concerns the gazillion features that microsoft has dumped into office 98 most of which are rarely used but add to the complexity of the interface microsoft has done a much better job simplifying the interface in this version but there's only so much they can do if they want to keep all those features
maybe someday microsoft will develop a version of office that lets users pick and choose which features they need apple did this already with opendoc so microsoft will probably come out with something like that in a few years but it may not run on macs
we live in a microsoft world for now microsoft has favoured us poor macintosh users with an excellent suite of software but who knows what the future will bring
we may as well enjoy it while we can

everyone rides their bikes differently some use them to commute others to transport goods and there are those who ride for pleasure or to race in competitions
then there are the illegal road-racers using their bikes to get a thrill and sometimes finding a shortcut to heaven or hades
most of us use our bikes for pleasure and to commute often glad just being able to avoid getting trapped in traffic jams
well-aware that not all bikers use their machines the same way castrol has done extensive market research here to enable it to identify the different needs of different riders
the result of its research is their new range of motorcycle lubricants that address the demands placed on the engines of the various categories of bikers
the research has also brought to light the fact that motorcyclists currently perceive motorcycle oils to be either mainstream' or better quality oils' and basing their perceptions mainly on the price of the lubricants
the current positioning of motorcycle oils in the malaysian market does not help the biker to select the best oil for his specific need however castrol's research and development programme as well as its international motorsports association with bike manufacturers has enabled it to develop specific formulations for lubricants to fill the different needs of the riders
among the castrol-sponsored riders who won international motorcycle titles in 1997 were american john kocinski and italian max biaggi who clinched the world superbike 4-stroke and world 250cc 2-stroke titles respectively three months ago
the new range of castrol motorcycle lubricants comprise of four grades each for both two-stroke and four-stroke engines these products range from castrol race economy 2t/4t at the low end for the work-horses' type of bikes to castrol stx 2t and gps 4t both of which are semi-synthetic lubricants at the top end for protection demanded by superbike users in between there are the castrol race plus 2t and 4t which are targeted at the commuter bikes as well as castrol race supreme 2t and 4t the latter two being part-synthetic based and formulated specially to deliver maximum power and acceleration
the important feature of this new range of motorcycle lubricants is that while each product has been specially tailored to the needs of whichever bike is to be used attention has also been paid to ensure that they deliver the high performance and excellent protection that has been the hallmark of castrol's reputation as the leading specialists in lubricants
furthermore to enhance the two products at the top end of the range for two-stroke bikes both castrol supreme 2t and castrol stx 2t now contain fragrance they also have reduced smoke and low smoke properties respectively
all eight products are available in one-litre packs from castrol motorcycle oil stockists throughout the country race economy 2t and race plus 2t are also available in half-litre packs
recommended retail prices for the one-litre packs are castrol race economy 2t rm540 castrol race economy 4t rm590 castrol race plus 2t rm690 castrol race plus 4t rm790 castrol race supreme 2t rm990 castrol race supreme 4t rm1090 castrol stx 2trm1540 copyright 1998 new straits times all rights reserved as distributed by worldsources online inc

spam spiced pork and ham was a rather disgusting tinned meat which was part of the british staple diet during the second world war
the british comedy series monty python's flying circus performed a famous sketch where terry jones dressed like a woman tells a guest what is on offer today egg and bacon egg sausage and bacon egg and spam egg bacon and spam egg bacon sausage and spam spam bacon sausage and spam spam egg spam spam bacon and spam spam sausage spam spam bacon spam tomato and spam spam spam spam egg and spam and so forth
a very silly scene but the pro-spam vikings in the background did give it a certain class
today spam is another word for junk e-mail it can be a message sent to hundreds of e-mail addresses or a message which is multi-posted to lots of discussion groups why spam
well you see it'severywhere and it's not very nice this is probably the best known example of netizen humour in action
other common terms for spam are unsolicited bulk e-mail and junk e-mail
figure 1 is an example of one i received
you'll notice that the subject heading re what a weekend makes you wonder if it's a friend using a new e-mail address
but back to that later first a quick note on the history of spam
in april 1994 laurence canter and martha siegel two lawyers with unsavoury backgrounds posted several thousand copies of an advertisement for their services to usenet in the space of a few hours triggering disk overflows network downtime and in some cases system crashes
as a result of this massive dump of duplicates into the usenet discussions new zealand's internet services were knocked completely out of commission and due to this wanton destruction spam suddenly became a hot issue
spam usually advertises something this may be a contest an offer of cheap airline ticket whatever sometimes you'll see spam in the form of chain letters or religious messages
the main thing that characterises spam is that it is posted in places where it shouldn't be spammers those who send junk e-mail typically send a message to many different newsgroups or a list of e-mail addresses with no regard to whether the subject matter is appropriate
no one will object to someone putting one small ad in a discussion forum dedicated to cats about a new flea powder specially created for fuzzy felines
just don't send it to anyone not interested in cats or flea powder netizens are vehemently opposed to spam for one thing it is considered bad netiquette as you have to wait while spam downloads and then weed it out
if you receive hundreds of real posts or e-mails every day and an equal amount of spam then this can become time consuming if the message is headed win rm20000 then it's easily identified and can be deleted without even accessing it
however it is especially annoying if the subject lines are unambiguous like my message headed re what a weekend then you're forced to read through the first few lines to see what it is
in response to thousands of complaints some bulk e-mailers working with distribution lists of private e-mail addresses have put the character stringb in the subject lines of their messages to indicate that the messages are bulk-class mail some users can filter their mail with smart packages capable of examining subject headers and filter out b-bearing messages
however not everyone can do this and many people pay for any mail received including filtered mail so this is not really a solution merely a sop
the second reason is far more serious and has legal implications the spammer does not pay the cost of sending junk e-mail it is paid by the sites of the recipient and others on the route
some e-mail providers charge by the number of e-mail messages received whether it's spam or not
netizens have reacted to spammers with incredible hostility
companies guilty of sending such messages often fake headers so complaining directly to the people responsible can be difficult those who send spam are aware that netizens are opposed to it and therefore ignore complaints
one group of netizens claims the best way to stop spam is to send messages of interest keeping them occupied and tying up all their resources on sales which will never happen
another group believes that the only way to deal with these people is to find out who they are advertise their true names and addresses and e-mail bomb them this is of course illegal but not unknown
internet service providers fed up with spammers and complaints from their users are now taking the battle to court
america online aol has taken firm action against spammers when sanford wallace of cyber promotions refused to stop spamming aol members aol collected all the undeliverable e-mail and sent them back in one go effectively knocking out cyber promotions internet provider uunet
uunet dropped cyber promotions as a client and wallace and aol fought out their battle in court
more recently when prime data worldnet systems inc and its proprietor hale spammed the net with messages advertising computer software products designed to enable other internet users to transmit their own junk e-mail to aol and its members in october aol took prime data and hale to court
on the whole the us legal system has fought for the internet providers and against the spammers the us already has a law which outlaws advertising by fax on the principle that the recipient has to pay for paper ink and other resources
the coalition against unsolicited commercial e-mail cauce is an internet organisation which is trying to ban us spammers by amending this law to include spam
most internet service providers will take action against spammers if complaints are made cutting off their connection and refusing them further services
despite all of this fuss some companies specialising in sending unsolicited e-mail are still trying to put the burden on the consumer saying that recipients must make sure they are not on e-mail distribution lists that e-mail providers must do the filtering themselves - in fact they are doing everything possible to make sure their lucrative businesses are paid for by the public
legitimate businesses try not to offend consumers and are now prepared to accept that internet culture forbids spamming
for example the canadian direct marketing association which 80 per cent of canadian direct marketing companies belong has voluntarily decided to implement rules which forbids their members to spam in january 1998
laws preventing spam in malaysia are expected to be instituted soon at the moment spamming is not a serious problem here as a precautionary measure however malaysian internet providers warn users against spamming and will close the account of anyone found doing so e-mail bombing and similar activities are similarly frowned upon
if you are receiving spam you can complain by sending the entire message to your service provider attach a polite message bringing this matter to their attention
remember that your service provider is not responsible for the spam they can only help you cancel the source and complain they may also shut their account if they continue spamming

do local mutual fund companies match up to international standards bhlbpacific trust management berhad strives to do just that its long termvision is in fact to bring international values and standards into themalaysian unit trust industry
a subsidiary of the bhl bank pacific trust was formed in december 1990
one of the largest unit trust companies in the country pacific trust hasin its basket four trust funds consisting of 12 billion units valued atrm800 million the four funds are the high growth fund the emergingcompanies growth fund the savings fund and the double growth fund bhlbasset management acts as pacific trust's fund manage
pacific trust managing director philip angers and its general managergoh teck eng give some insight into the funds they manage
how have your funds been performing
angers we have been consistently outperforming the klse compositeindex our own benchmark and the competition we moved into cash in earlyfebruary the reason was because we felt markets were over-heated and thatinvestor's expectations are too high we felt that it was more prudent tocapitalise on profits and to come back to the market when the situationreturned to normal
what are your asset allocations like currently
angers overall we are now about 50 to 60 per cent into cash the fundthat is most heavily into cash is our savings fund which is about 63 percent into cash followed by our high growth 60 per cent the emergingcompanies growth 57 per cent and the double growth 50 per cent
which stocks are you heavily invested in
goh we're quite well diversified our portfolio is based on exposureand equities and there isn't a specific sector that we're concentratingon we give equal weightage to each sector
angers we're basically top-down driven but we do our research from thebottom-up in malaysia we look into the various sectors and we act asvalue-managers by value we take into consideration the historical trendsand also sentiment which is a strong fundamental factor
what is your position on buying
angers inflows are good and redemption is low because we have beeneducating our clients there is incredible buying opportunity we haddecreased our equity holdings before the crash we are buying selectivelyand we will continue to buy for the rest of the year
what is your investment strategy
angers we are a conservative firm we see ourselves as medium and long-term fund managers local fund managers tend to have high expectationsthey expect returns within three to four weeks their time horizons aretoo short we plan for the medium to long-term of three to five years
recently we were criticised by clients when we moved into cash but wewere looking a long way ahead the current market crisis proved us rightwe sacrificed short-term losses for long term gains
we have a disciplined approach where we have careful guidelines onstocks of course we take into consideration the price earnings peratio and the dividend yield at the same time we also look into themanagement of the companies the turnover of management as well as thetype of industry the company is in again we take a top-down approach
goh we tend to be prudent our aim here is on consistent returns
how is research conducted
angers besides the usual bloomberg reports and other neccesaryequipment we also have brokers but we don't just rely on them we go outand check the information that it is current and not already known to themarket since we're the second largest unit trust firm in malaysia wehave a valued account you could say we have a high purchasing power wedemand excellent service from our brokers
our fund manager's office consists of 30 people seven are fundmanagers we work as a team and we make a top-down decision for assetallocations each fund manager also looks at one or two specific sectors
there is more than a single fund manager for each fund although we have asingle point of responsibility for each account we do this because if amember of a team leaves the rest of the team will not be left in a lurch
each member is cross-trained
what is the arrangement with rothschild asset management in overseeingyour offshore investments
angers we do not offer a percentage of the company to rothschild we'renot in a financial agreement what we have is a memorandum ofunderstanding rothschild gives guidelines on cash management they areexternal fund managers and they are paid a fee we maintain control of thefunds and determine how much to invest in them while rothschild picks thestocks
what markets are you invested in overseas
angers we are currently in singapore hong kong thailand thephillipines and indonesia our biggest investment right now is in hongkong which is about 30 per cent of the total overseas investment
are you planning to introduce new funds
angers we hope to introduce an islamic fund by the end of this year andlater a fixed income fund and a regional fund hopefully by mid- or end-1998
goh we hope to one day have a basket of variety

shipping magnate frank tsao wen king's capitalistic ventures are temperedwith compassion and charity
in 1993 shipping taipan tan sri frank tsao wen king had a littlestroke' since then he claims to have slowed down a bit'
but his concept of slowing down' is pretty alien to the rest of earth'smore slothful lethargic population at 72 tsao has relegated the reinsof his sprawling shipping empire to second son frederick chavalit tsao
however he still keeps an eagle eye trained on his property and realestate ventures and the other branches of his huge chinese hong - whichcentres on the four core human areas of eating living wearing andtransportation - are as hyperactive as ever says his driver in brisk hongkong-inflected cantonese tan sri's pace is blistering'the blistering pace' kicked off almost five decades ago when tsao wasin his twenties life - and business - hasn't exactly been a honeymoon forthe transport tycoon going by the condensed version of tsao's war-ravaged internecine childhood when i talk to the rest of my generationi get the feeling that in a way we were born in the worst of times andalso the best of timeswhen i was born there was civil war shanghai was being torn apart bywarlords then in 1931 the trouble between china and japan escalated withon-and-off wars in 1937 there was a full-scale war so i was brought upin a background of perpetual war'but tsao persevered in the face of such adversity as his father'seldest son and heir tsao worked in a bank in the morning in an import-export company in the afternoon and studied way past the midnightwitching hour
however the tsaos were not destined to remain in china in 1948 thefamily fled to hong kong when i left shanghai we had lost almosteverything the tsaos left behind houses businesses and land in china
subsequently we had a very hard time in hong kong which was nicknamed''the city of paupers' relates a lively loquacious tsao to malaysianbusiness in the serene surroundings of his hillside hong kong home it'scertainly ironic his home now is far bigger than the 2000 sq ft hongkong duplex that he shared in 1948 with assorted relatives and fouremployees
the hong kong of that era says tsao was incredibly backward imagine aplace whose population had swollen almost in the blink of an eye from lessthan a million to two million people determined to eke out a living thehardy disciplined tsao continued to carry out import/export activitiesand administrative work at his family's small representative office inhong kong
how did he start in shipping it was a logical extension of hisimport/export activities right after 1950 the korean war broke out
ships in different chinese ports were blockaded by the navy hampering theoperations of tsao's branch offices in china this forced tsao to go intotriangular trade - between hong kong japan and china - using charteredships he bought essential foodstuffs from china and sailed his cargoes toembargoed japan since trade and economic activities were virtually at astandstill japan had no foreign exchange meaning that all business wasconducted on a barter basis but tsao wasn't content with just charteringships he wanted to own his own vessels
to a large extent this ambition was sparked by an incident in 1950 whentsao spotted a 3000-tonne ship while walking along the piers that dottedthe hong kong harbour his desire to own such a magnificent ship'prompted tsao to study shipping journals and shipping organisations and tofamiliarise himself with freight markets
as he later recounts in his book success and succession tsao wrote iboarded ships going from engine room to deck and talked to anyone onboard willing to share their knowledge and expertise with me' aftermonths of leg and brainwork tsao bought his first vessel a ship built in1918 tsao retrofitted the vessel and placed it in service on schedule
that heralded the start of the tsao shipping empire which later becameknown as international maritime carriers imc ltd today his imc groupof companies is a regional giant and it has its fingers in varied pies
imc offices are in a clutch of cities and countries including rotterdamnew york london hong kong singapore indonesia philippines australiaand thailand apart from shipping and property we're in cementpharmaceuticals investment holding and financial instruments such asstocks and bonds' says tsao
as befits a hong kong magnate tsao's property interests are immense infact property and his pet subject - manpower development - occupy thebulk of his time today' says tsao i'm doing only real estate inbusiness you cannot run away from property' closer to home kuala lumpurplays host to an imc landmark the eponymous 29-storey menara imc at jalansultan ismail which says tsao was kl's first intelligent building'tsao's malaysian property interests also include a substantial stake inhillcrest gardens sdn bhd a property development company with projects ingombak and puchong plus a piece of prime land around the jalan tun razakarea
down south in singapore tsao is the force majeure behind suntec city as$2 billion rm44 billion development project incorporating mega officeand retail space suntec is controlled by a consortium of deep-pocketedhong kong taipans including li ka shing and run run shaw commercialproperties aside even tsao's private residences run into the millions
the hong kong home where this interview was conducted has a market valueof us$ 8 million to us$ 10 million rm272 million-rm34 million hissingapore home is also said to be worth a sizeable amount next to whichthe value of his kuala lumpur kenny hills bukit tunku retreat pales incomparison
but tsao's roots are entrenched in shipping despite the breadth anddepth of his diverse empire now says the tycoon his son runs theshipping show in a nutshell tsao's shipping business covers the wholespectrum from shipbroking and chartering to related stuff likewarehousing trucking container terminals and shipyards but he echoesthe views of many other shippers when he laments shipping is not veryprofitable it's a very difficult competitive and sophisticated business
it's capital-intensive operations-intensive and risk-intensive but thereturns are least intensive you get better returns if you deposit moneyin the bank'nevertheless tsao observes that the shipping industry's emphasis isshifting from the west to asia asian ships today constitute more than 40per cent of the total number of ships in the world
his reputation as the grand old man of the sea means that people stillapproach him for advice according to tsao's own count i've been inshipping for half a century' at home in hong kong imc is the island'sthird largest listed shipping stock imc also has a secondary listing onthe stock exchange of singapore however not many foreign analysts andfund managers follow the stock which is as low-key as its owner says ahong kong fund manager he's a very shrewd man but rather low-profile'how many ships does imc own the number is not important big ships maynot be as expensive as a very small ship we own very different kinds ofships tankers bulk carriers liners all sorts' says tsao but in 1995it was reported that the group operates a fleet of more than 50 vessels - including panamax bulk carriers and tankers - amounting to more than 157million dwt deadweight tonnes
in malaysia imc's shipping arm is wawasan shipping sdn bhd which wasset up in 1992 wawasan owns 11 tankers and is one of the major partnersof global maritime ventures bhd a shipping venture capital company tsaoalso holds interests in certain other shipping companies in the east asianregion such as japan's fleetworld ltd thailand's united thai shippinglines and malaysia's very own malaysian international shipping corporationmisc in fact tsao was with misc from the very beginning in 1968
elsewhere tsao also owned 814 per cent in listed malaysian insurerjerneh asia bhd as at 30 april 1997
after more than 30 years doing business in malaysia tsao's easyfamiliarity with the country is enough to shame a native he exhibits aknowledge of local people and history that's ineffable having rubbedshoulders with luminaries ranging from tunku abdul rahman to tun husseinonn
ironically his maiden malaysian venture had nothing to do withtransportation instead tsao went into textile milling the wearing'part of his four core business areas at that time malaya had justattained independence but british influence was still pervasive
reminisces tsao when i first applied for a visa i was rejectedbecause the authorities thought i was a communist' at that time anti-communist fever was still raging but tsao passed stringent immigrationchecks and went on to establish malaysia's very first integrated textileplant in johor baru in 1958 his malayan weaving mills did pretty well infact tsao even went on to supply the designer batik draping the lissomepretty boys and girls working for malaysia and singapore airlines all theairlines' textiles and military textiles were supplied by tsao's mills
today there are three mills under imc's malaysian textile divisionrunning spinning weaving and dyeing operations
it was while he was in the thick of textiles that tsao was roped in byhis buddy robert kuok to assist in the setting up of misc tun ismailali robert kuok and i started the shipping business in malaysia amongthe three of us only i knew the shipping business' as such hisexpertise made him a permanent fixture in misc till today tsao serves onthe misc board as deputy chairman
his faithful services in the name of malaysian shipping didn't passunnoticed in 1972 tsao received his cherished tan sri-ship and eightyears ago tsao became a malaysian citizen that was during the uncertainpolitical climate in hong kong following the 1989 tiananmen squaremassacre' recalls tsao at that point there was a big outcry aboutgetting alternative passportsalthough tsao opted for malaysian status the rest of his family wentseparate ways tsao's parents siblings and children have meandered allover the globe nomad-fashion quips tsao we all have differentpassports' in fact over the years tsao was the only one of his familyto stay put in hong kong earlier on his parents decamped to the greenerpastures of brazil while his siblings scattered to the four corners of theworld tsao's first-born architect calvin tsao lives and practises in newyork while tsao's wife was in america at the time of the interview hisdaughter who trained in pediatrics worked in new york before returningto the far east eventually she ended up in singapore where she runs thetsao foundation a charitable organisation funded by tsao second sonfrederick adopted thai citizenship as well as the thai middle namechavalit and shuttles between thailand malaysia and singapore
judging by the numerous high achievers in his family tsao seems to haveinculcated a desire for self-improvement among his kin but his wish togroom and educate people isn't limited to his family circle tsao is anardent believer in the development of manpower he likens manpowertraining to planting a fruit tree the tree may take some years to growbut you can have the fruits every year'his version of upgrading human capital encompasses more than merematerialistic benchmarks like raising per capita gross domestic productand purchasing power parity instead tsao wants to inculcate skills andknowledge in mankind in this sense tsao's humanity and compassion forhis fellow man seem acutely honed and it's not a chauvinistic taskconfined to any particular race or nations
for instance malaysia has benefited tremendously from tsao's vision andaltruism apparently tsao was instrumental in setting up a malaysianmaritime academy a few years following the inception of misc to addressthe dearth of local shipping personnel if we engaged foreigners aloneit would be useless but there were no locals to run ships no localofficers and crew'tsao envisioned a maritime school par excellence a naval west pointacademy' in reference to the prestigious military academy in the unitedstates which is as highly rated as britain's sandhurst after enduringvarious delays and reams of red tape the melaka seamen's training schoolakademi laut melaka was set up twenty hectares of land in the-thenfinance minister tun tan siew sin's constituency was purchased as theschool's site to start the ball rolling tsao donated rm250000persuaded kuok to make a similarly sizeable donation and presto themaritime academy was born the raw material that was to be shaped intotough disciplined seafarers consisted of dropouts youngsters who couldbe a social problem if they're not educated'
on a more traditional academic plane tsao is also contemplating a newventure in malaysia possibly involving higher education and informationtechnology but this is still preliminary and very hush-hush however therationale behind the idea remains the same tsao is worried about thedearth of trained people whenever i start something my biggest problemwill be the people how to get the right people this is what i getworried about this lack of skills please pay attention to trainingmalaysians'closer to hong kong tsao is now looking at means and methods ofdeveloping china and its people with a healthy dose of humanity thrown in
of course many have queried his motives behind sinking in money andeffort into a place that he left so many years ago tsao himself says thathe made his first visit to china thirty years after leaving shanghai buttsao firmly believes in the future prosperity of china reiterating hispet thesis he insists that the chinese people must be trained in effortsto upgrade their living standards tsao himself has contributed money andideas towards aiding china for instance he's venturing into foodmassive crops of fruit but there's a shortage of buyers the result - over-ripe fruit just going to waste while the planters suffer i'msetting up food processing facilities maybe to make some other value-added product that will benefit the farmers because a lot of food-processing companies are bleeding smaller players' says tsao
judging from this tsao's capitalistic business ventures appear to betempered with compassion and charity and his ethnicity seems to be onefactor in his business success if one buys the fable about chinesebusinessmen being among the best in the world like many other overseaschinese tsao carries genes imprinted with sound business savvy hisbusiness blueprint is moderated by the chinese traditional principles bywhich he abides in success and succession tsao outlines his principleswhich are basic values like prudence thrift patience diligence andknowledge most crucial he says one must be human' in fact the book'stheme revolves around regard for tsao's fellow man
for instance the principle of rn stresses compassionate concern forone's fellow beings to quote tsao guided by rn a genuine leader leadswith sincerity of intent and exemplary performance rn demands that onemust not consider what benefits oneself as benefit one must strive forbenefits that will benefit all under the heaven'''ultimately points out tsao he's working for the benefit of futuregenerations tsao is far from hedonistic and he's keenly aware of hishumanity and thus his mortality the bittersweet fruition of his laboursof love won't be savored by him but by his offspring and their peers
as he puts it poignantly i'm over seventy pretty soon i'll have tosay bye-bye and go off to see god'

pg36 can malaysian banks perform even better in the year 2000's global leaderboard
asia is in the news banks are in the news in fact malaysia and itsfinancial services organisations could not have hoped for more publicityalbeit the present dose is of questionable impact
in the midst of this the local banks are moving ahead not quiteunscathed but certainly not browbeaten arab-malaysian bank has increasedits assets and deposits five-times in two years malayan banking bhd hasjust posted a sterling pre-tax profit of rm22 billion an increase ofmore than 20 per cent over its previous year's earnings phileoallied hasa giddy loan growth rate of about 170 per cent compared to the pastyear's rhb sakura merchant bankers has an impressive 17 per cent capital-adequacy ratio and hardly any non-performing loans
it is also interesting to note that half of the top ten largestmalaysian banks in terms of assets have asset growth of more than 20 percent and are achieving return on equity of 177 per cent on the average
hongkong bank malaysia has the highest figure of the ten banks at 229per cent for an asset growth of 155 per cent however when put againstthe other large banks in the region it does appear that the local banksare some distance away from the top see diagramgiven the local banks' current performance the pressing question is howthey can increase their growth and returns to leapfrog into the 21stcentury and compete with the best global players
winning formulaa recent andersen consulting survey revealed that high performingfinancial services organisations are able to deliver an average 35 percent revenue growth and an average 44 per cent return over the past 10years these organisations go beyond the familiar practice of adding valueto their customers capturing value' seems to be how the cream of theworld's financial services organisations do it
two key pathsthese value capturers achieve their top positions either through aconsolidation' or innovation' approach
consolidation is the choice of most traditional banks and insurers thisis essentially a mergers and acquisitions approach
consolidators buy revenue and pay for it with cost savings by drivingcosts out of their operations they can then deliver products at or belowmarket prices bank negara malaysia is already actively encouraging thesestrategies and local financial institutions would do well to heed theconsolidator approach
the innovators experience a more challenging process they focusrelentlessly on delivering unique compelling value to their customers
this often means that they are able to craft value propositions' that arepowerful enough to attract competitors' customers and retain theirloyalty and configure their business so that these value propositions'can be delivered
unlike consolidators innovators generate profitable growth throughproviding superior value to carefully targeted customers
innovation an alternative to consolidationit is common knowledge that there ought to be fewer larger banks inmalaysia we have written two articles in this publication on the whysand hows' of the consolidation approach towards that outcome but what isthe new innovation approach how do successful innovators deliver theirunique compelling value propositions
innovators use technology to deliver value collaborate through alliancenetworks virtualise their balance sheets and foster an entrepreneurialculture
deploying technologyanalysts proclaim the need for southeast asia to move onto the globalstage across the causeway the four big banks not only have presence inmost of asia pacific but also in britain and the united states malaysianventures overseas have begun to make their presence felt in these markets
in the words of bankers the tools necessary for such expansion aresimple capital and technology
innovators go beyond using technology to achieve greater efficiencywhich to them is already a necessity not a differentiator innovatorssuch as the charles schwabs of the world will examine the essential roletechnology plays in delivering value to their customers examples includeusing technology to enable superior information management needed toimprove risk pricing strengthening the customer interface deliveringproducts and services with the speed and convenience customers demand andsupporting collaboration with alliance partners
collaborating through alliance networksvertical integration is a thing of the past successful innovators aregoing for virtual integration they outsource most commodity transactionactivities so that they can focus on knowledge intensive value-addingactivities
no doubt nike epitomises this the idea need not be confined to theproduction of fast moving consumer items a renowned regional airlineoutsources its accounting operations to an entity in china and dataprocessing to another in india there is much potential for virtualintegration to assist financial institutions in delivering more focusedand creative attention on their customers can malaysian financialinstitutions reach this goal
virtualising the balance sheetconventional wisdom in financial services tend towards maintaining highlevels of assets on the balance sheet but innovators think otherwise
many use capital markets to secure assets
while this is still a relatively unsophisticated market in malaysiamany financial institutions are exploring opportunities to repackagecredit card receivables mortgage loans etc to be resold' in thesecondary market benefits of this approach include better capitalutilisation improved fee-based income and enhanced capacity to capturelarger business volumes financial institutions in the advanced marketssecure up to 80 per cent of their portfolio
fostering an entrepreneurial cultureinnovation requires an entrepreneurial mindset this quality must not belimited to the person who started the business it has to be encouragedand developed throughout the organisation malaysians with their strongentrepreneurial culture and support by the government would easily taketo the idea
innovators build such mindsets within their organisations through theuse of equity rewards would motivation and service levels not be improvedif we could make our employees shareholders in the company
mind the rocksstaying on par with the competition let alone beating them andmaintaining that lead is no easy task the value-capture path willcertainly yield tremendous rewards but it requires an unwavering focus onrenewing customer value and excellent execution skills can malaysianbanks perform even better in the year 2000's global leader board we thinkso after all to quote winston churchill the empires of the futureare empires of the mind' this article is contributed by andersen consulting malaysia's financialservices industry team any queries or comments can be directed tomalaysian business the views expressed are the writer's own

this latest addition continues an exceptional tradition of aeronauticalengineering excellence which began in 1958 over the next four decades thegulfstream name has become synonymous with corporate aviation
the gulfstream product line began in 1959 with the certification of thegulfstream l the first aircraft ever designed and built specifically forbusiness aviation this maiden gulfstream was a large cabin twinturboprop introduced by the grumman corporation utilizing the latestengine technology the gl provided a unique combination of speed rangepassenger comfort and reliability never before available for businessaviation
seven years later came the transcontinental gulfstream ll the firstcorporate jet capable of carrying 12-19 passengers plus crew for longdistances at jetliner speeds as the hallmark of the gulfstream name thegll established a completely new standard for business aviation byestablishing an entirely new class of aircraft in terms of range comfortand overall performance in 1978 gulfstream raised the bar once again byintroducing the glll with a larger cabin higher cruise speeds and 30 percent greater range as compared to the gll
the gulfstream lv received faa federal aviation administration typecertification in 1987 compared with the glll the glv provided 10 percent more cabin area 15 per cent greater range and typical cruise speedsexceeding mach 080 over 525 mph with this aircraft the gulfstreamname set new standards in business aviation for performance comfort andreliability for the fourth time and in 1992 the glv-sp was introducedbringing increased flexibility to the most popular large cabin businessjet ever produced by increasing the maximum landing weight the sameaircraft that provides 4200 nautical miles of range also allows itsoperators to make multiple shorter flights without the need to refuel atevery airport
the glv series is the most popular large-cabin business jet everproduced with more than 300 now in service around the world but with theintroduction of the ultra-long range gulfstream v gulfstream now has twoentries into the large cabin business jet market segment the gv provides6500 nautical miles of non-stop range a cruise ceiling of 51000 feetand cruise speeds above mach 085 this aircraft not only allows thecomfort of cruising above the weather but also above the winds when theyare unfavourable to the flight plan any two locations on earth arereachable with no more than a single refueling stop and already thisaircraft is establishing an unprecendented record of operationalreliability
a major contributor to gulfstream's record of reliability performanceand efficiency has been rolls royce from the gl's dart turboprops to thespey turbofans on the gll and glll the high bypass turbofan tay engineson the glv and the new bmw-rolls royce br710 powering the gv rolls roycehas provided every engine ever flown on a gulfstream when it comes toperformance efficiency and reliability the names gulfstream and rollsroyce go hand in hand
the gulfstream line was originated by the grumman corporation but in1978 aerospace entrepreneur allan e paulson bought it over from grummanfor us$52 million in 1985 he sold the company to an expanding chryslercorporation for more than 12 times that amount a few years later mrpaulson teamed up with the investment firm of forstmann little and boughtback the company from the recession-plagued chrysler for us$850 million
under forstmann gulfstream's fortunes have soared notching recordearnings of us$47 million last year up 63 per cent from 1995 it hasamassed a us$3 billion backlog of orders for the glv-sp and gv to datethe company has produced 1000 aircraft for corporate government privateand military customers around the world forstmann the wall streetdealmaker famous for his leverage buyouts is a flying' advertisement forgulfstream - he owned three gulfstream aircraft before he bought it over

there are some danish parents who might not be reassured by their children's promise to take the bus home after school _ the bus serves free beer
the bus in herning 270 kilometers 170 miles west of copenhagen was hired by a local bar and waited last friday outside the local high school to give students a ride to the east end bar with beer and music free en route as well as another free beer at the bar
it's the latest move in efforts by danish pub owners to attract young drinkers other bars have taken up moves such as handing out half-price drinks tickets outside schools
the efforts have attracted some drinkers but also the government which is not intoxcated with happiness over the moves justice minister frank jensen said monday that police would be asked to withdraw alcohol licenses for bars that recruit underage drinkers
the case from herning is the latest is a long series of bad initiatives to get young customers he told danish radio
the east end's owner per tavlov grevstrup said he was surprised by jensen's statement which doesn't fit with the positive reactions he had received from the pupils
about 15000 people some waving anti-american banners protested monday in the montenegrin republic as a us envoy tried to defuse a power struggle that could explode into violence
tensions have risen in montenegro since milo djukanovic won presidential elections last october he is to officially take over on thursday
however the outgoing president momir bulatovic has said he doesn't recognize the result and has called for large protests
montenegro is a republic of about 600000 people that joins with much larger serbia to form yugoslavia bulatovic is an ally of yugoslavia's strongman president slobodan milosevic
djukanovic won election by challenging milosevic and he seeks more autonomy for montenegro
demonstrators who answered bulatovic's call to block the transfer of power waved flags some with communist red stars and chanted slogans thousands of people came in from across the republic
one banner read down with the terror of the american government and its envoys who bring discord to our people
one such us envoy robert gelbard was in montenegro and met with both bulatovic and djukanovic
gelbard expressed his support for djukanovic and indicated that bulatovic had promised to step aside
he said the united states welcomes the recent free and fair election of milo djukanovic as president of montenegro we look forward to his inauguration and to further deepening of democratic institutions in montenegro
gelbard said it would be a serious error to oppose in any way the will of the people expressed in that election he said bulatovic told him that he accepts and honors the election of his foe
patriarch pavle the head of the serbian orthodox church appealed to montenegrins to calm their passions lower their voices so words would not turn into armed conflicts
pavle also appealed indirectly to bulatovic to prove that longtime rulers could be changed without violence
security was tight police most of them loyal to djukanovic checked incoming buses thoroughly for weapons they said later they had confiscated 180 pistols two semi-automatic rifles 35 sticks of explosives and four other explosive devices from arriving demonstrators
bulatovic had said he expected 100000 people at the rally far more than actually came
after the old yugoslav federation of six republics split up in war in 1991-1992 events in montenegro could jeopardize the new smaller yugoslavia too
djukanovic has angered milosevic with his demands for reform and milosevic could intervene with the army or special police
belgrade media under control of milosevic have run a virulent campaign against djukanovic relations between many serbs and montenegrins once considered virtually the same nation have worsened
federal courts based in the serbian and yugoslav capital of belgrade have ruled that djukanovic's victory was invalid this incensed most montenegrins who resent serb domination
this has split montenegro and its 650000 people in two with djukanovic backers increasingly favoring independence and bulatovic supporters still loyal to milosevic and serbia
bulatovic supporters mostly live in northern montenegro next to serbia they have hinted they might try to split montenegro and join serbia
the turkish government said monday it would not bow to the remaining demands of hundreds of prisoners who have been on a hunger strike in an eastern jail
we have decided on the principle not to meet the demands of the hunger strikers state minister ahad andican told reporters after a cabinet meeting
about 170 leftist or kurdish prisoners at erzurum jail are refusing food some now for 53 days in an effort to push authorities to improve conditions thirteen of them are reported to be in serious condition
prison officials already have agreed to meet 49 of the 52 demands made by the prisoners including increased family visits improved food more recreation hours and permission to keep radios
but the officials denied permission to hold sports competitions the right for ward representatives to meet as well as regular visits between wards
their demands have nothing to do with the improvement of humanitarian living conditions andican said
human rights groups on monday criticized the government's stance
the prisoners deaths will be their responsibility akin birdal president of the independent human rights association told the associated press
turkish inmates often go on hunger strikes as a form of protest they often take only sugared water which keeps them alive for a long time but ends up paralyzing or blinding them after a month or two
thousands of leftist and kurdish prisoners ended a nationwide hunger strike last year that left 12 dead after the government gave in to their demands and improved conditions

when ici recently bought a clutch of speciality chemical firms fromunilever for almost five billion british pounds the price raised a feweyebrows but ici wasn't just purchasing physical assets in the case ofone of the star performers national starch at any rate it was acquiringapplied knowledge or intellectual capital
nowadays more an applications engineering consultancy than a commoditymanufacturer national starch has spent the last three or four yearsworking on a knowledge programme it has turned a latent strength - technical expertise - into an actual strategic one a market-leadingability to design minutely specialised applications for its foodmanufacturer customers this is a very successful programme' says chucklucier chief knowledge officer for consultants booz allen &amp hamilton
it's part of the reason unilever got such a full valuation of the companyon the sale'
over the past couple of years consultancies like booz allen havewitnessed a stampede of companies eager to get a touch of what seems likethe nearest thing to a philosopher's stone that management has yetinvented a means of transmuting the base metal of everyday experiencethe routine orders fulfilled and deals struck into the folding greenstuff knowledge management is hot - the next big agenda idea' accordingto a comprehensive forthcoming report by the research firm businessintelligence creating the knowledge-based business
enthusiasts claim successful programmes can produce returns of hundredsor even thousands of per cent but as the bi report also emphasisesknowledge management is a young discipline its subject as elusive andintangible as air knowledge assets operate by disconcertingly differentlaws to material assets and managing them requires an entirely newmanagement lexicon reports bi no large organisation has effectiveinformation management let alone knowledge management practices embeddedthroughout its organisationwhether knowledge' can live up to the boldest ambitions of itschampions is a moot point but there is no doubt that it is an idea whosetime has come peter drucker naturally claims to have invented the termknowledge worker' in the 1960s and excitable commentators have beenbandying the idea of the information age around for at least 20 years nowat last we can begin to see what it means to say with drucker that the keyproductive resource of the new era is neither labour land nor capital butknowledge
in his book intellectual capital the new wealth of organisationsthomas stewart cites a raft of statistics to show that the long-heraldednew dawn has truly arrived in the united states the proportion ofknowledge workers - those working with information rather than things - will have risen from 17 per cent to 59 per cent over the course of thecentury while those handling material things will have halved to 41 percent perhaps most revealing of all in 1991 us business for the firsttime spent more money on information technology - equipment to captureprocess analyse and distribute information - than on production plant andequipment the gap has steadily widened since call 1991 says stewartyear one of the information age
in this context the case for managing knowledge is simple as elisabethlank the enthusiastic director of icl's knowledge programme puts it ifyou run a factory making physical goods you have a system for locatingthe parts bringing the bits together at the right time and assemblingthem so that the finished product come out the other end in a knowledgebusiness the product is intangible but the same principle applies youneed to know where the knowledge components reside so that you can bringthem together in the serviceicl realised early on that it couldn't be the problem-solving serviceoutfit it aspired to become without knowing what knowledge it had anddeveloping mechanisms to bring it to bear on the business it really isan asset' says lank and treating it such changes the lens through whichyou view the world how do you measure it what do you need to invest inwhat new roles must you create to make it work as soon as you stop tothink about it it's obvious that in almost all companies knowledge is avastly under used resourceit's not just companies which obviously sell know-how that are gettingthe picture witness unilever - and ici shell ibm hewlett-packardanglian water glaxo wellcome dow chemical monsanto merck bt
lucier at booz allen confirms that 75 per cent of its clients are intoknowledge management in some form the growing knowledge component of evenmanufactured goods means that leaving it to chance is not an option todaya car as much as a financial instruments competes by virtue of theembedded knowledge in its design and performance in the information ageasserts brian arthur of the influential santa fe institute products areno longer congealed resources' but congealed knowledge'
leaving aside the sweep of macro economic forces at the micro levelknowledge management picks up on and crystallises several of the decade'smost compelling management propositions the first is the 1990s obsessionwith organisational learning one result of de-layering and down sizingwas meant to be less bureaucracy more knowledge sharing fasterdecisions in some cases it was more often the result was a forgettingnot a learning organisation as companies flattened their stock ofexperience along with the hierarchy and found they had out-sourced theability to make the wheel let alone invent it
the second is growing discontent with conventional accounting
the best candidate the knowledge or intellectual assets
the third powerful trend that knowledge management taps into is thetechnology of the net a mere two years ago even switched-on companiessuch as reuters weren't sure whether the internet was the real thing nowwe know almost all large companies now have a website and three-quarterseither have or are constructing an intranet granted it is not thetechnology itself but what is done with it that is important
nevertheless the net is vastly attractive for those that get it rightas a vector of knowledge on demand while technology isn't essential in aknowledge programme it sure helps' says lucier more subtle but in thelong run perhaps even more significant will be the internet's influence asthe model of a knowledge-reproducing structure fluid inventivedistributed self-organising more like an ecology than any consciouslybuilt organisation
so how do you manage knowledge at conceptual level knowledgemanagement appears at first glance disarmingly simple construct aknowledge database of useful information already floating around somewherein the organisation make it available perhaps via an intranet and standback to admire the results bt for instance claims a first-year costsaving of 150 million pounds from compiling an electronic internaltelephone directory hardly rocket science hewlett packard boasts similarsavings from its corporate directory of expertise or yellow pages inmost organisations there's some good accidental knowledge managementgoing on' says lank the question is making it conscious andsystematic'clearly that is more easily said than done according to lucier just15 per cent of the programmes he monitors are successes in the sense ofproducing real business results while 35 per cent show no return for theeffort if anything he believes the meagre proportion of successes maybe going down
why should this be one reason is undoubtedly the faddism that hasdogged every new management initiative of the last few years there isplenty of evidence of ceos loading knowledge management as the latestsilver bullet without the understanding or the commitment to link it tobusiness issues another heavy selling by it-based consultancies ofintranets and other technology solutions' without regard to theunderlying issues of the case or to the behavioural implications of thenew systems says lank lots of companies have spent great amounts ofmoney on intranets and lotus notes without the culture to back it up
we've learned that while technology can help what knowledge management isabsolutely about is the way people work togetherat a deeper level there is - no way around it - an epistemologicalquestion what is knowledge anyway as the business intelligence reportshows it can be cut in a variety of different ways tacit/explicit know-what/know how individual/group data/wisdom none is definitive andin each knowledge behaves - and must be managed - in bewilderinglydifferent fashion in practice says mike mcmaster of consultantsknowledge based development most knowledge management programmes attemptto simplify the nuances away by acting as glorified expert systems aimingto capture verify and make available existing knowledge on a systematicbasis
in this field by general consent the big management consultancies arethe most advanced practitioners they need to be in business sellingknowledge to international clients and expanding in some cases by 20 or 25per cent a year they couldn't function without a deep well of corporateknowledge to draw on a good example is booz allen's system - knowledgeon-line - a 24-hour-a-day electronic database and data map of what thefirm knows and who knows it the programme operates at three differentlevels as an educational tool to foster basic consultancy skills in aworkforce where 40 per cent of staff have a year's booz allen experienceor less as a repository of functional often it knowledge andstandardised methodologies for journeymen consultants and as a means ofdeveloping leading-edge strategic thinking among the partners at the top
both the collection and dissemination elements of the activity requireconscious effort and multiple approaches says lucier we say thatknowledge management doesn't happen automatically because it involves fourunnatural acts people have to be willing to share best thinking useother people's ideas collaborate with other experts and evolve theirthinking' most organisations he says do a couple of these things wellwhich ones vary dramatically from company to company
does it work while conceding that tracing a link between the programmesand the bottom line is nigh impossible lucier doesn't even feel the need
on a back-of-the-envelope calculation' he says the internal rate ofreturn from the consultancy hours we save is in the thousands of per cent
at low level we measure how intensively people use the database at highlevel we have had an extraordinarily good few years of highprofitability it's like asking motorola if quality has made a differenceour business has prospered - and we are convinced that one of the reasonsis knowledge'many managers and shareholders of course would go dizzy with delightat such important gains but while accepting their value some thinkersbelieve there is more to the business of knowledge than the mechanisticexpert-systems approach in their view the high rate of failure in thenew wave of programmes is precisely the result of its inability to captureknowledge's most precious quality its ability to generate and recombinein new patterns a lot of knowledge management seems no more than sexyup-to-date databases' observes mcmaster they're great systems what'smissing is the generative aspects of intelligence - the life to makeknowledge systems work'the conventional knowledge-management consensus is that creativeknowledge production is impossible to analyse - opaque unpredictable andtherefore infuriatingly unmanageable not so counters mcmaster while theresult is unpredictable and it certainly cannot be imposed from abovenothing is more certain than that a living dialogue between individualintelligences centring on tangible issues - whether cutting costs inassembling an offshore oil platform or making better welds - willrecombine to produce usable knowledge the chief resources required forthis kind of knowledge work are time and space for the conversations todevelop perhaps a minimum of it to cross the time zones - and cruciallythe community of interest to provide the spark that makes things happen
if the design principles are right then knowledge sharing is the mostnatural thing in the world
one of the best known examples of this kind of knowledge management is3m powered by multiple overlapping scientific networks communities ofenquiry the 15 per cent rule' which allows employees to spend thatamount of time on their own projects and the governing principle that 25per cent of company turnover must come from products introduced in thelast four years 3m scientists in hundreds of divisions produce an endlessstream of new products sometimes based on brand new knowledge more oftenby recombining existing knowledge in different and creative ways foranother example take - surprisingly - the us marines working closelythe us marines have quietly overhauled their fighting strategy out hasgone the tradition of a rigid central battle plan but radicaldecentralisation does not mean that individuals are left to fend forthemselves instead units are schooled to work with a small set of basicrules keep moving use surprise take high ground where possible forinstance from which to generate their own unique strategic variationsaccording to the circumstances the distilled knowledge lies in thedeceptively simple rules but just as important is the creativeintelligence and urgent purpose of the fighting units that bring it tolife
wise companies will accept that thinking about knowledge itself willevolve in just this way in a rich interplay between theory and practicestructure and experiment and human and organisational intent whateverthe direction in which the formal frameworks of knowledge managementevolve though it will be forward not back while the overall movementwill contain fads and false starts there is no doubt that the underlyingchange they are attempting to capture is as profound as the firstindustrial revolution 200 years ago in the age of the man-made brainpower industries' lester thurow's term advantage will accrue toknowledge not traditional natural resources finding out how to manage itbest may take 15 or 20 years the journey starts now
after receiving a record number of visitors last year the anne frank house will extend its hours to accommodate the busy summer tourist season
in 1997 more than 700000 people visited the house-turned-museum where anne and her family hid to escape nazi persecution during world war ii

q when deleting e-mail is there a way to mass delete messages so i don't have to get rid of them one message at a time
a yep and the same basic procedure applies to the mail features of internet explorer ie netscape navigator or america online aol in each case display a list of messages then press the control key while selecting the messages you want to remove
to delete the selected messages in ie or navigator either choose the delete option from the edit menu or right-click your mouse on the selected messages and choose the delete option from the menu that pops up
in aol just click delete at the bottom of the window
q when i installed ie 4 my computer slowed down considerably what's causing this and is there anything i can do to improve the speed
a speed can be a problem if you're running the active desktop feature of ie 4 active desktop gives weblike properties to the windows desktop but it also eats up a lot of a pc's resources you probably won't notice it if you have a superfast chip and 32 megabytes of memory but on older systems performance can drop the easiest way to get back up to speed is to turn off the active desktop you can turn the desktop off or back on by clicking the start button pointing to settings pointing to active desktop and then clicking view as web page before you disable the active desktop however you might try fine-tuning your hard disk which sometimes can improve system speed to do that run scandisk and disk defragmenter both of which are in the system tools folder inside the accessories folder in the windows 95 start menu scandisk checks the disk for problems and can fix basic ones disk defragmenter rearranges data on the disk to make it run more efficiently
q i just bought a computer with windows 95 it has a program called microsoft fax i want to use it but i'd like to know if i need a separate phone line for faxing also do i need a fax machine or can i use my printer
a with microsoft fax or any other faxing software you can send and receive faxes without a fax machine all you need is a fax-capable modem and i assume that if your computer is new it came with one you don't need a second phone line either just hook up your regular phone line

last week's blown-up front-page picture in the new straits times showing the mangled wreckage of a fiery four-vehicle collision in pakistan during which 50 died and seven were injured is a stark reminder to malaysians that we are not exempt from such horrendous accidents
we have had our share of similar horrors in the past two years although mercifully the death toll was much less early last year as the nationwide fatalities soared to a high of 6233 for the first 11 months of 1996 421 more over the 1995 figure prime minister datuk seri dr mahathir mohamad himself spoke out in frustration as to what else could be done to save lives road safety campaigns and stiffer penalties obviously had little effect
as clearly recklessness of motorists is a major cause of accidents on malaysian roads it will indeed be a challenge to the authorities who hope to cut the number of deaths by 30 per cent this year malaysians will no doubt be keeping tabs anxiously especially during the double festive season at the end of the month when more than one million are expected on the highways and roads in their annual balik kampung
the new year did not start off well for the malaysian motoring public
just as we are hoping that the clean slate would last for some time two fatal accidents were recorded last week the pahang and sabah accidents took six lives including four from the same family and injured nine the nation also viewed with dismay the police report that the last four weeks of 1997 saw 546 people killed in 19447 accidents compared with 498 deaths in 15811 accidents in december 1996 despite the higher december figure the good news is that the fatalities for the whole of last year have dipped slightly compared with the previous year from 6304 to 6293
but sadly the attitude of malaysian motorists does not seem to be on the mend according to the police their presence and media publicity on a nationwide 14-day traffic operation launched on dec 21 had not deterred 73462 motorists from flouting traffic laws along highways and trunk roads a total of 21121 or 2875 per cent of the total summonses were for speeding the other main offences were overtaking along double lines dangerous driving and failure to abide by traffic regulations
just as it was revealed at the close of the year that there was an alarming increase in the number of road rage cases reported to the police in the past two years there was yet another case in the new year to add to the tally meanwhile the report by the national institute of occupational safety and health that it is concerned over the increasing number of workers involved in accidents while commuting to work brings no cheer
given the nation's perennial high accident rate aggravated by the irresponsible attitude of many members of the motoring public it is high time stiffer laws were introduced as an immediate deterrent
incarceration mandatory for cases involving deaths and serious injuries and suspension of offenders' driving licence are known to be effective
the more than 90 per cent compliance with the ban on the use of handphones while driving two months after it was enforced in 1996 is a case in point bullies should be severely dealt with as a lesson to others as in the anti-littering campaign tougher legislation and stringent enforcement must go hand in hand with education particularly of the young the government's campaign to promote safe riding has produced some results with the significant drop in the number of fatal motorcycle accidents the effort needs to be intensified
while the clamour for the death sentence a sign of the outrage over rising reckless and dangerous driving has been turned down there should be no let-up on the part of the authorities to quickly introduce comprehensive and tighter legislation to deal with this problem the public is still awaiting the promised amendments to the road transport act 1987

would the phenomenal growth of franchises worldwide see people eating thesame type of food dressing in the same kind of clothes and using the sametype of equipmentsupporters of franchises would certainly balk at such a suggestion
leonard n swartz world-wide managing director of arthur andersen'sfranchise services department disagrees vehementlywe are not trying tomake people all over the world into a homogenous society this is one ofthe most creative distribution tools ever it has proven to be veryprofitable for both franchisors and franchisees'he also denies that it will stifle creativity of entrepreneurs infact what franchisors such as mcdonald's do is to encourage franchiseesto create some localised dishes suitable for local tastes the new dish isthen made a standard feature among all the franchises in that country'how do the franchisors address the problem of contentious governmentregulation of the business we have advisory groups in every countrycomprising both franchisors and franchisees who discuss issues withgovernment authorities in this way we try to offer our views' saysswartz
does the world really need franchises and what are its advantages anddisadvantagesthe united states department of commerce quoting from arthur andersenreports says that more than 90 per cent of franchise outlets survive atleast five years and are still in business today compared with theeventual failure of over two-thirds of new non-franchised enterprisesmostly within the first year of operation
the most common reasons given for franchisors in singapore are that itfacilitates business expansion 82 per cent alleviates manpowershortages 55 per cent and enjoys economies of scale through bulkpurchasing 52 per cent
most people have the impression that in the franchise situation it isalways the franchisor who wins swartz disagrees it is a win-winsituation franchisors benefit from the motivation and drive of theirfranchisees while franchisees benefit from the franchisor's businesstrade secrets and industry knowledgein particular franchisors receive upfront an initial franchise feewhich together with royalties ensures a constant cash-flow allowing forrapid expansion with less capital when compared with a direct investmentor joint-venture overseas
franchisors are able to tap difficult markets while spreading thebusiness risk among their franchisees and both the franchisor and itsfranchisees can pool their advertising resources thereby reducing thestrain of high marketing and advertising costs
franchisees also receive the right to use the franchisor's well-knowntrademark name and logo thus capitalising on the franchisor'sestablished reputation and image franchisees receive trade secrets andexperience reducing start-up problems encountered by most new businesses
they also receive ongoing assistance and guidance from the franchisor aswell as access to new technological developments
what are the problems encountered by both franchisor and franchiseeawalan abdul aziz the chief executive officer of the malaysian franchiseassociation mfa says most of the problems stem from the fact that theindustry is still new in malaysia we only seriously looked intofranchises during the 1992/93 period the united states had a headstart inthe 1920s possibly earlier it's a mature industry there and it hasironed out a lot of the teething problems here we are just beginning toexperience it
we have quite a number of local business people rushing to franchisetheir business although they have only one outlet and their product andsystem have not been sufficiently tried and tested these people alsoknown as fly-by-night' franchisors are only interested in collecting thefranchise fee and royaltiesan industry source cites the case of a local master franchisee whichoffered franchises to eager franchisees and then practically neglectedthem causing the franchisees's businesses to flounder in an effort tosave their business the franchisees formed a consortium and with theministry of entrepreneur development's help managed to stay afloat throughmutual support the master franchisee just dropped out of the picture butnot before collecting thousands of ringgit in franchise fees androyalties even the equipment it supplied was later found to be obsolete
however problems are quite common even in mature markets for examplefranchisors complain that franchisees do not follow their system properlydo not keep to standards and do not pay their fees franchiseesmeanwhile grouse that not enough advertising and promotional work isbeing done and that support systems are unsatisfactory
but so far according to awalan there has been no known litigation inmalaysia most problems are resolved through negotiations and sometimesthrough the mfa as the mediator the important thing is that what mightwork very well say in the us may not work here at all we have a lot offranchisees who in their eagerness to have their own business signfranchise agreements blindly they don't even read a single word' helaments
an industry source says that sometimes to show that there are moresuccessful startups than failures of their franchises some franchisorstake back the ailing franchisee business and get another franchisee toturn it around they than chalk it up as a success instead of a failure
this is because they know franchisees rely a lot on the success rate oftheir franchises
another reason cited for the failure of some franchises is that themarket is not ready yet for the product a good example is sate yaki alocal food packaged in a japanese style which was brought in by a localtycoon's son in the eighties according to an industry source the conceptand product were very good with state-of-the-art kitchen equipment andsystem costing rm2 million but the venture failed because it is believedthat at that time malaysians were not ready for that kind of packagingyet they were more caught up with american fast-foods like kentucky friedchicken and mcdonald's
from the franchisor's point of view thomas s monaghan founder andchairman of domino's pizza inc recalls how his business went through badtimes because of one man whom he trusted too much i left most of theday-to-day operations and even the financials to him what i learnt fromthis experience is that as franchisor you must know the financial statusof the business at all times you must know what is going on it meansdoing your rounds at the stores' says monaghan who has franchised 58000outlets in 58 locations worldwide
monaghan 60 still does his rounds every week in the us he also haswhat he calls operational auditors' who go around all the stores to checkon the standard of quality of the stores the pizza itself receives abadge of approval from blind tasters of the sauce we give the recipe ofthe dough to our franchisees but we supply them the sauce ourselvesbecause of its secret contents' he says
overall he believes in giving flexibility to the franchisee forexample in malaysia the franchisee can have seafood toppings there isalso no bacon as the pizza is certified halal he feels it is veryimportant to get the right kind of franchisee because if you get a badfranchisee it's very difficult to get them out and it may end up inlitigation on the other hand some of our best ideas came from ourfranchisees' the other things monaghan insists upon as franchisor isbeing courageous in enforcing standards and being upfront to thefranchisees about the pitfalls of the business
from the point of view of the franchisee abdul rahman nordin managingdirector of two marrybrown chicken's franchises and who is also its firstbumiputera franchisee says the franchisee must also work hard to ensurethe store is properly run even though the system and product are proven
your turnover and how long it takes to break even depends very much onthe location of your store for example it took about eight to 12 monthsat the university pertanian outlet while it took the marrybrown larkinterminal outlet in johor only six months' he says
because location is so important abdul rahman laments the fact thatmany developers of shopping malls have side-stepped local homegrownfranchises in favour of foreign ones they should have more confidence inlocals if you don't even allow them to set up shop how can they becrowd-pullers in the first place' he asks that is why local franchiseesturn to rural areas and now they are being followed by the foreignfranchisees'how do we resolve some of the problems facing the franchise industrythe most significant event in the franchise industry is possibly the newfranchise bill which is expected to be tabled in parliament next year
according to an industry source the bill takes all that is good fromother countries' legislation and adapts it to the malaysian scenario' forexample it is expected that there will be a disclosure obligation' onthe part of the franchisor in outlining the system fees training and itsprofile and background with possibly a cooling-off period allfranchisors and franchisees will be expected to register with the ministryof entrepreneur development thus ensuring that the industry is monitoredwithout being over-regulated
then there is the franchise contract a source says that certain termscould be made a standard in the contract for example the extent ofterritorial exclusivity currently the laws which govern franchisesinclude the contracts act 1950 the trade marks act 1976 the copyrightact 1987 and the patents act 1983 english common law such as the tort ofnegligence and passing off and the law of breach of confidentialinformation are also applicable
would-be franchisees says awalan could go direct to the franchisorthe mfa or the ministry to find out the franchisor's background profilepackage system operation and training programme - basic stuff thatshould be provided for in the disclosure documents they should also seeklegal advice before signing the franchise agreement as well as seek anaccountant's advice on the financials break-even figure and projectedcash-flow'
according to swartz success in franchising boils down to five keyrequirements these are present in the most successful franchise in theworld - mcdonald's namely a tried-and-tested business format adistinctively recognisable tradesman a good on-going support system forthe franchisee business know-how and the drive ambition andentrepreneurial spirit of the franchisees'
in fact monaghan admits he is a great admirer of ray kroc founder ofmcdonald's he did not have the traditional trappings of a businessman
he was very focused on the basics for example quality service he was ahamburger man and that was good business plus he had vision'end tx ldwould the phenomenal growth of franchises worldwide see people eating thesame type of food dressing in the same kind of clothes and using the sametype of equipmentsupporters of franchises would certainly balk at such a suggestion

if the government-proposed franchise cities self-contained townshipswhere all retail outlets consist of franchised outlets to be located inseberang jaya and johor baru are anything to go by it would appear thatwe will soon be riding on the crest of the franchise wave now sweepingacross asia
although singapore is seen as an international franchise hub malaysiais keen to jump onto the bandwagon the aim is to establish malaysia as aregional hub
in fact the malaysian franchise association mfa in one of itsnewsletters goes as far as to say that malaysia is destined to be asia-pacific's growth centre of franchising' and that already many malaysiancompanies have successfully managed well-known international franchises inthe region others have successfully expanded their home-grown franchisesabroad' it is not surprising that malaysia is currently rated 21st on thelist of countries in the world and second within asia in terms offranchise development
the franchise concept started in malaysia as early as the 1950s withforeign franchises like the singer sewing machine company taking root itwas joined later by fast food eateries like a&ampw restaurant kentucky friedchicken and mcdonald's presently the franchise landscape in malaysia isstill dominated by the fast-food restaurants
some of the other sectors include the hospitality industry convenienceshops petrol stations photography services pharmacies fashion andapparel beauty saloon building services electric and electronicproducts telecommunication jewellery and professional services seetable on profile of franchises
the ministry of entrepreneur development med through the franchisedevelopment division fdd is a one-stop agency assigned the task ofspearheading the development of the industry in 1992 its immediate taskwas to identify existing and established local franchise products andmatch them with highly motivated local entrepreneurs who had financialresources according to awalan abdul aziz chief executive officer of mfathe government's aim is to use the franchising system as a leap-froggingexercise to create more local entrepreneurs
as of july 1997 there were more than 130 franchised undertakings inmalaysia of which 40 products were registered under the franchise unit ofthe med the med now has more than 300 registered franchisees at the sametime there are more than 90 foreign franchises in malaysia likemcdonald's esso shell bp hilton and holiday inn which have more than1000 franchisees under them
according to a report by arthur andersen the american franchises leadin local market share with 60 per cent of the total market valued at us$106 million of gross sales next are the japanese with seven per cent
comparatively the market share of home grown franchises is insignificant
local franchisees are expected to experience rapid growth in the late1990s and beyond in terms of the number of franchise concepts andfranchisees so far the local franchisee industry has averaged an annualgrowth of around 10 per cent
in the united states franchising generates a staggering us$ 800 billionworth of business in gross sales each year and represents 38 per cent ofall retail trade it is estimated that by the end of the year 2000franchises will account for more than half of all us retail business whatthat means for malaysia is that there is still a lot of room for growth
leading the domestic franchise industry is edaran otomobil nasional bhdeon the sole distributor of proton cars established 13 years ago eonhas ventured into franchising for the distribution of its new cars andafter sales services as of august 1997 it has 250 franchised outletswith a yearly turnover exceeding rm3 billion it is currently working ontwo more products motoria distribution of used cars and eon innovasigifts and premium products
under the seventh malaysian plan the government has allocated rm6million for franchise development the government recently introduced asoft loan scheme which involves an interest subsidy of rm13 million onloans taken by franchisees from selected banks and financial institutions
also under consideration is a franchise fund that has been allocated rm100million to be administered by the perbadanan usahawan nasional acorporation for entrepreneurs
according to awalan franchises comprise only about four per cent ofretail outlets in malaysia the reason for the smaller number is not somuch because the start-up one-off cost is too high although that isalso something to bear in mind we do have franchise start-ups as low asrm10000 for example nelson's ice-cream it is more to do with the factthat the industry is still new in malaysia having really taken off onlyin 1992-1993' he says
according to the mfa's newsletter an untapped possibility forfranchising is in the halal food industry considering that there are 13billion muslims around the world who consume a staggering rm500 billion ofhalal food a year the prospects are tremendous in malaysia alone with12 million muslims the industry is worth rm20 billion a year' says thereport
mfa has proposed several strategies to push the franchising conceptfurther including encouraging corporate involvement in the development offranchise systems encouraging the conversion of existing business chainswhich have the potential for franchising such as hotels restaurants andretailing proposing tax incentives and establishing the malaysianfranchise institute with a view to assisting in research and development
with the strong support of the government and the readiness ofmalaysians to accept new products and services franchising is set tobecome one of the most important ways of doing business in malaysia
end tx ldif the government-proposed franchise cities self-contained townshipswhere all retail outlets consist of franchised outlets to be located inseberang jaya and johor baru are anything to go by it would appear thatwe will soon be riding on the crest of the franchise wave now sweepingacross asia
although singapore is seen as an international franchise hub malaysiais keen to jump onto the bandwagon the aim is to establish malaysia as aregional hub

malaysian business' special focus on the local banking sector as seen inyour sept 16 issue is a charming piece for the banks that were featured
it clearly outlines their history and their achievements their aims andtheir future challenges a most interesting read for sure
coming in the wake of the recent forex crisis this special focus isironically timed reading it one would imagine that all is fine and dandyon the malaysian banking front and yes all was and has been very wellindeed for the malaysian banks at least for the last decade or so
however the times are a-changing and if the regional financial crisisis anything to go by then malaysian banks should take note that the leanyears after the decade of fat years are approaching and they had betterbe prepared for some trimming of the bloated profits that they have cometo regard as their due
forgive my perception but i believe malaysian banks with the exceptionof a rare few are rather insular in their outlook and have generallyresisted the various calls to merge reduce bureaucracy or go full swinginto the it era more often than not they have to be literally draggedinto the technological age whether by tough governmental policy or by thefear of losing out to their more wily competititors
in your cover story vaulting to victory' the writer states that asmalaysia marches towards industrialisation its financial services sectoris being geared for change to bring about this transformation the allimportant banking sector is at the forefront of this evolution which ismarked by mergers liberalisation innovations in service and a move tobecoming more service oriented
becoming more service oriented is the sore point here all banksinvariably claim that their future strategies are primarily targeted atpleasing and assisting the customer not for some banks it isn't as afrequent bank user one gets the impression that all the technologicaladvances the fancy packaging the incentives etc are targeted mainlyfor the corporate clients and high worth individuals not so much for theordinary man-on-the-street
your article states that maybank the country's biggest bank with 480outlets became the first malaysian bank in 1979 to embark on acomputerisation program imagine 18 years of being fully computerised andatm users of the kawan-ku system are still forced to use the pin numbergiven by the bank while other banks encourage atm users to personalisetheir pin numbers to ensure utmost secrecy this humongous organisationalong with a few other banks does not offer atm users this much neededoption
recent reports of the high spate of unauthorised atm withdrawals is acase in point such instances could have been avoided if not considerablyreduced by simply allowing atm users to personalise their own pinnumbers instead of which the affected banks claim that atm users eitherpassed on their pin numbers to others to use or they unwittingly allowedsomeone behind them to memorise' their pin numbers
this is patently ludicrous have you ever tried memorising a six orseven digit number memorising a telephone number is already a difficultfeat let alone trying to memorise a stranger's pin number over theperson's shoulder come on this explanation is indicative of how somemalaysian banks squeeze water from stone - the onus is on the card holderto prove that he could not have done what the bank claims he did
the establishment of a bank mediation bureau testifies to the vital needto address this unfair situation whether this bureau will be able tofunction effectively remains to be seen but at least it's a start fornow the more staid malaysian bank will have to undergo a total mindshift
alliedbank is a shining example despite being only three years old ithas embarked on its futuristic banking role with the tremendous gusto andenergy of a yuppie its introduction of online banking via palworld andmore recently its introduction of palkiosk etc is meeting the needs ofits ever growing client base
the banking industry is expected to find itself under tremendouspressure globally where once banks ruled the roost in the area offinance banks will soon be merely one of the many different outlets thatoffer total and complete financial services
private companies that used to go begging to the banks for loans willfind it easier to be a lender instead of a borrower through the issuanceof sophisticated and unconventional financial instruments thesecompanies led probably by the cash rich insurance sector will findthemselves flush with funds and can therefore charge lower interest ratesthan their conventional banking counterparts
banks will be forced to offer an ever expanding array of products toattract new clients while keeping their existing clientele satisfied sothe current dismal turtle-paced move onto the information highway willhave to be accelerated if banks want to play a more regional and globalrole
in line with the nation's aging population banks will of necessity moveinto such lucrative areas as mutual fund development the total funding ofreal estate development with greater emphasis on the building and runningof geriatric townships and private nursing homes to cater for theretirement years of millions of merdeka babies'
profitability will be razor thin and banks will have to learn to beagile and nimble they will have to work in an era of global deregulationand liberalisation function without the possibility for traditionalgovernment protectionism and carve their own special niche in the cutthroat world of banking in order to survive and prosper only the leanmean and keen organisation will make it through are malaysian bankspreparing themselves for this likely scenario it should be interesting tosee

in the last article we examined the shadow effect in microsoft word pre- word 97 versions by combining the various shadow effects with the different kinds of shapes possible in wordart one can obtain splendid shapes suitable for posters and publicity material
generally when you create a figure in wordart and then try to add ordinary text to the side of the figure the cursor refuses to move out of the rectangle surrounding the figure
the reason for this is that the wordart figure is normally inserted into your document as an object this object occupies the entire space to its left and right hence it is not possible to add text in this area to overcome this problem you need to use insert - frame
this command creates a rectangular frame around the object and confines the space occupied by the object within the frame
thus after inserting the frame you are able to shift the cursor to the side of the wordart figure and type in the text
before you add the frame you will see a black line with handles around the wordart text
when you place your cursor on a handle dark spot the cursor changes the shape to an arrow that indicates you can make the rectangle around the words - and the size of the words - larger or smaller by keeping the left mouse button pressed down and shifting the cursor in the direction of the arrows
however once you have inserted a frame you will see a fuzzy line surrounding the wordart figure
you will still see the handles that allow you to resize ie change the size of the wordart text
in addition the cursor changes the shape to a little cross with arrows at the ends when you place it on the wordart text
this cross indicates that you can shift the wordart text to wherever you wish by keeping the left mouse button depressed and moving the cursor to the desired location
the frame feature is extremely useful for producing professional-looking work that seems to have jumped right out of a printed textbook or poster
you can add borders and shadows for the borders that will enhance the appearance of your work
after you have added the frame you can invoke format - frame
this feature can be activated only if you have added a frame and have clicked on it so the outline of the frame the rectangle with the fuzzy borders is visible
the format - frame command opens the frame dialogue box which has four buttons at the bottom namely ok remove frame cancel and help
the first button allows you to exit the screen once you have chosen your options the second allows you to cancel this command
the third button allows you to remove the frame ie undo the insert - frame command
the fourth button brings up the help screens associated with this feature
the top left of the screen has an area labelled text wrapping
it has two little rectangles labelled none and around
the none option allows you to enter text above and below the wordart text but not to its left or right
the around option allows the text to flow around the wordart image
there is another area at the top right of the frame dialogue box labelled horizontal
within this area to the left there is a pull-down menu labelled position which has several options such as left right center inside and outside
the centre option for example places your text in the centre of the paragraph with the text flowing around it
to the right of the position menu you will find another pull-down menu labelled relative to
the options provided include margin page and column
for example if you have chosen the centre option in the position pull-down menu the margin option allows you to now locate the wordart object horizontally relative to the left and right page margins
the page option will centre the wordart object relative to the left and right edges of the page
the column option will centre the wordart object relative to the left and right borders of the column - and is applicable only if you are using the columns feature
at the lower left of the horizontal area there is a spinner ie a menu where you can add increasing or decreasing numerical values by clicking on the up or down arrows respectively labelled text
a larger number creates a greater distance or amount of space between the vertical borders of the wordart figure and the text
the lower left of the dialogue box has another area labelled vertical
it has the position pull-down menu with the options top bottom and centre
the relative to pull-down menu has the options margin page and paragraph
if you choose top and page from these menus word will place your wordart text at the top of the page
on the other hand if you choose top and paragraph the wordart text would then go to the top of the current paragraph instead of the top of the page unless of course you are in the first paragraph in the page - in which case the top of the page and the top of the paragraph will become identical locations
the distance from text spinner allows you to choose the amount of space you wish tocreate between the horizontal borders of the wordart figure and the general text
the lower left of the frame dialogue box has an area titled size
the width pull-down menu has the options auto default option and exactly
auto allows word to choose the width of the wordart figure for you automatically
if you choose exactly you will need to enter an appropriate number in the menu labelled at to the right of the width pull-down menu
unless you are creating some exacting artwork and are willing to make appropriate measurements to enter the appropriate numbers in this menu you are advised to choose auto
the height pull-down menu that is located below the width menu works in a similar manner
again i recommend you to choose auto to avoid the hassle of making accurate measurements
1 text times new roman 12 type in the full text justify the text ie
straight left and right margins
2 insert - object wordart type in text the power celebrators in three separate lines
3 choose the deflate shape second column fifth row in the shape pull-down menu
4 click outside the figure to return to the word document then use insert - frame now shift the wordart figure to the middle of the text the text will part and flow around the figure
5 invoke format - frame choose the option around for text wrap
6 in the area titled horizontal choose position - centre relative to - page distance from text 02 inch
7 in the area titled vertical choose position - 03 inch relative to paragraph distance from text 06 inch

map - site of tanjung pelepas port altermative services in the making
malaysian ports are gearing up to entice business away from formidableforeign competition
malaysia's burgeoning domestic and foreign trade is a strong case forsupporting not only a viable national shipping industry but also thedevelopment of the necessary infrastructure especially ports this willhelp reduce the balance of payment deficit sooner than expected
port operators are constantly reminded that the only way to do well in acompetitive business is to be cost-effective efficient and innovative
operators especially those at port klang face competition and resistancefrom both within and outside not only in trying to entice malaysia-generated transhipment cargo away from singapore but also to increasemainline calls the rule of the thumb is without sufficient cargo andextensive and reliable feeder services to neighbouring ports no linerwill come calling to any port
the three private terminal operators in port klang - kelang containerterminal kct kelang port management kpm and kelang multi-terminalkmt - can handle a combined container handling capacity of slightly overthree million twentyfoot equivalent units teus by the year-end theirtotal teu throughput is expected to enjoy a00re attractive because ofseveral factors they include more regular mainline calls a comprehensivenetwork of feeder services and lower ocean rates although its portcharges are higher shipping lines remain attracted by its efficiency
singapore port' points out a shipper can handle 60 teus per hour'port klang operators however remain undaunted by the formidable foreignport to the south in the last one year they have succeeded in divertingat least 10 per cent more of transhipment cargo from singapore offeringshippers no excuse to claim lack of capacity port klang is supply drivenand in fact by the year 2000 its combined teu capacity is expected toreach five million teus
although still relatively new and very much in the development stagewestport at port klang has seen its teu capacity slowly attracting newbusiness according to kmt executive vice chairman datuk g gnanalingamwestport expects 1998's throughput to almost treble to 300000 teus orabout 30 per cent of existing capacity it has already spent rm12 billionof shareholders' funds on the initial phase of its physical developmentand expects to spend up to rm4 billion eventually when the whole portcomplex with its facilities is completed at the turn of the century toturn port klang into a world-standard port' kmt's own container terminalwill then have a handling capacity of 27 million teus
kct the first privatised port entity is in an enviable position ofhaving achieved more than 80 per cent teu capacity with this year'sthroughput estimated at about one million teus it is expanding capacitythrough more efficient quayside operations and is maximising use ofavailable space at north port as for kpm it has a 850000 teu capacityand is operating at about 70 per cent
how is port klang shaping up in its quest to become the country's mainloadcentre and regional port hub how is it faring in the face of growingcompetition among asian ports generally rather well it must be pointedout in recent years port klang has proven to be more than just anirritant to singapore which is expected to do 16 million teus this yearneck to neck with hong kong
nevertheless port klang's estimated 17 million teu throughput by year-end is still a paltry 12 per cent share of the total asian containertrade estimated at 70 million teus compare this to singapore's 16 millionteus 162 per cent and with hong kong which is expected to play secondfiddle for the first time this year singapore's teu includes a close to20 per cent container load to and from malaysia malaysian ports arestriving to woo this load over at least most of it anyway through betterand more efficient ports feeder services and attractive rates
by the turn of the century malaysian ports including the new tanjungpelepas port on the western side of johor to the south of the busy malaccastraits will have a total combined teu capacity of about 10 million teus
when completed tanjung pelepas will have an annual teu handling capacityof 38 million teus with its planned road and rail connections it couldoffer reliable alternative services for peninsula exporters/importers whohave been going through singapore
by the year 2000 according to drewry shipping consultants of londonthe total throughput in southeast asian ports is expected to reach about35 million teus with singapore expected to maintain its share of about 58per cent at about 206 million teus singapore will be spending about s$4billion within the next few years to improve its port facilities andservices following the corporatisation of its operating agency theremaining 42 per cent representing 144 million teus will be handled byother regional portsincluding port klang
kct managing director abdul samah mohamed is optimistic of newpotentials opening up for malaysian ports like his fellow operators inthe country he shows little of the pessimism that has arisen in certainquarters following the recent upheavals in the currency and stock markets
he talks about sustained strength' of the regional economies malaysia'sown economy held up very well in terms of import and export activities soas to place a continuing challenge on its port system' players withinthe port system he adds have responded with what he calls a resoundingwillingness to sink in further investments in upgrading facilities andenhancing service quality
he says the strong volume support in terms of indigenous trade to andfrom malaysia has been matched by similar growth in cargo movements to andfrom neighbouring regions of indonesia and the eastern regions of theindian sub-continent given the strong bridge of direct calls that hasemerged on account of the strong base load offered by malaysia's owneconomy through port klang new opportunities have begun to arise forusing such direct calls as a base for the regional grouping of cargoinvolving the indonesian ports of belawan and jakarta and malaysia's ownports of penang in the north and others in the southern and easternregions of the country' he says
furthermore with strong growth in throughput registered in ports in thecoastal states of the bay of bengal a new challenge opens up for portklang to offer the transhipment connection for these regions via mothervessels already making regular calls abu samah says

the economic and currency woes of southeast asia is not a deterrent forgerman companies to do business with the region
the economic and currency turbulence that has struck southeast asia hasnot deterred many german companies from doing business with the region
indeed they remain confident that the crisis will soon blow over
some german multinationals such as the ludwigshafen-based chemical giantbadische anilin-sund soda fabrik ag better known by its german acronymbasf says that it is absolutely confident' about its malaysian partnerpetronas the basf group derived some three per cent - or roughly 18billion deutschemarks - of its turnover from the association of southeastasian nations asean region though this figure may appear small it isquite large considering that basf has just recently launched its expansionplans for the asean region
basf's expansion plans include the construction of a large chemicalcomplex in malaysia with an investment tag of 13 billion deutschemarksof which 60 per cent is being pooled in by the basf group and theremaining 40 per cent by its malaysian partner petronas ludwigshafen-based sources quoting john feldmann who heads the southeastasia/australia division at the singapore base of the german group saythat the malaysian joint venture with petronas is in no way endangered
they argue that petronas after all is an extremely strong group with ahigh export rate another positive sign' is the fact that the malaysianpartner a state-owned concern has not been forced so far to pay anyspecial taxes or effect other payments to the state coffers as is thecase in other southeast asian countries
the basf sources claim that none of the other partners have so farwithdrawn from this project however basf is going to institute somemeasures as a result of the currency crisis for instance the group willtry to increase the malaysian stake in the project although the ringgit'sdepreciation in relation to the deutschemark has been remarkablyrestrained and far less dramatic than in comparison to the us dollar
the asean region is of great significance to basf this becomes obviouswhen one considers the fact that effective oct 1 the group's new divisionfor colours which comprises textile and leather chemicals colouringagents and printing systems started its operations at the singapore base
over and above the chemical group is also eyeing china for expansion fromhong kong where joachim hambrecht one of the directors responsible forthe overall asian region has his base he oversees a turnover of nearlyus$ 6 billion 1996 the share of local production meanwhile liesbetween 30 and 40 per cent this is also the case with the asean region
basf is planning to increase this share to 50 per cent by the year 2005and to 70 per cent by the year 2010
despite the currency and economic crisis that is currently plaguing theasean countries basf has been emphasizing that it does not plan to changeanything after all the fulcrum of the textile industry has shifted toasia and german companies have followed it there in view of the highdebt rate of companies and governments in countries such as indonesiamalaysia and thailand particularly in the financing of real estateprojects through credits in foreign currencies the crisis originatingfrom thailand has become acutely visible the reality shock' has beenthere but the emotional reactions are more dangerous
unlike other companies basf did not have to take any special measuresto cushion itself against currency turbulence since it had planned to usethe revenue earned in the local weakened currencies for new expansionprojects however it would be difficult to effect price hikes growth inthe southeast asian countries is expected to continue although at a lowerlevel of between two and seven per cent annually varying from country tocountry
another german company barmag ag of remscheid-lennep a leadinginternational supplier of chemical fibre machines with a strong base inasia says that the currency turbulence in the southeast asian countrieswhich are also the world's leading manufacturers of textiles will notaffect its overall business our business is done mainly in us dollars'say barmag executives
barmag representatives acknowledge that the weakness of southeast asiancurrencies could in the final analysis have negative effects on theircustomers' investment decisions however the effects would not be veryserious because the fierce competition in the region would eventuallycreate tremendous pressure for modernisation if one company invests theothers have to follow suit' is the argument put forth by barmagexecutives barmag's business ties with asia including the asean regionhave been much older than most of the other german companies
one of germany's big three banks the dresdner bank says that it willnot change its asian strategy despite the recent financial crisis insoutheast asia our strategy is medium- and long-term oriented' saysgerd hausler a board member of the dresdner bank responsible for theasian operations our medium-term evaluation of the growth outlook forasia is good' he adds however the bank is examining individual creditengagements and project financing
hausler has been cautioning against making a sweeping generalisationabout the entire region and calls instead for a case-by-caseexamination of the countries however he has admitted that he is prettyuneasy' about the situation in thailand he has noticed firstly a slowlygrowing awareness of the problem in that country and secondly the lack ofprofessional management to master the crisis there
added to this is the fact that the thai government has collectivelyresigned impairing the country's competence over and above thegovernment shows no willingness to get outside professional expertise tohelp in the crisis situation many companies and banks in thailand havelittle or no experience in how to restructure the balances and how toreplace for instance short-term debts with long-term maturities thereis simply no expertise available on the possibilities of using modernfinance-technical instruments' says hausler according to him this madea crucial difference to the debt crisis of mexico where the united statesnot only provided financial help to its southern neighbour but also theexpertise for an active crisis management to this effect there were manybusiness possibilities in the area of investment banking
another major group the abb asea brown boveri also says that it willnot scale down its operations in asia despite the financial crisis if inthe past it was considered an economic wisdom for companies to reducetheir investments in crisis regions this dictate does not apply now in anenvironment of globalisation indeed abb's reaction to the southeastasian crisis has confounded people in germany switzerland and sweden thegroup has decided to axe some 10000 jobs in western europe and america inthe coming two years and instead create new jobs in asia abb hasdeliberately intensified its investment in the once dynamic tigereconomies' which are bleeding because of the crisis and have delayed manyof the mega projects such as the bakun hydroelectric dam in malaysia wherethe abb group had hoped to source business worth some 36 billiondeutschemarks
abb expects that its overall profit for 1997 contrary to its earlierprojections will be lower than in the previous year thanks partly to thelosses suffered by it in asia and if the special costs are also takeninto account the net profit will be slightly above the zero level becauserestructuring the job cuts would cost the group some us$ 850 million andthe delay of the bakun project another us$ 100 million
abb managers are quick to point out that the cost-cutting measuresincluding slashing of jobs is difficult to explain to the germantechnical staff at abb's operations in mannheim but they say theemployees who work in the export department would immediately understandthe measures for exports to indonesia thailand or malaysia have becomeextremely difficult for the abb at the present moment after the currenciesof these countries depreciated so radically against the us dollar forinstance any agency in these countries that had ordered a power stationthree months ago would not be able to pay for it with a currency paritythat had plummeted by 30 per cent

tsao misc is quite healthy financially
frank tsao wen king has no designs to relinquish his malaysianinternational shipping corporation stake
tan sri frank tsao wen king has a strong streak of sentiment when it comesto shipping his affection is especially pronounced in the case ofmalaysian international shipping corporation misc
currently tsao owns 23 per cent in misc a bloc acquired in1968 thepassion for shipping that runs in his blood means that he has littleintention of surrendering his misc stake although fellow misc compatriotrobert kuok - malaysia's very own sugar king - sold out a long time ago
muses tsao i'm a shipping man today i own 23 million shares attoday's oct 12 1997 price it's worth roughly rm150 million to anindividual it's an astronomical sum but to a shipowner it's not thatsignificant'exactly how did tsao get into misc for the answer dredge up ancienthistory as tsao recalls the japanese government awarded a sizeable sumof money to its malaysian counterpart the moolah was a goodwill gesture
in return malaysia would abandon its compensation claims for japanesebrutality during world war two
malaysia decided to use the money to buy ships but there was a problem
there was excessive japanese cash for one ship but far too little for twoships
tsao's solution after negotiating with the shipbuilders we got twoships by paying cash outright instead of paying on an instalment basis'says the genial gracious tsao who is now chairman of imc group ofcompanies a hong kong-based mega shipping empire
his coup was rewarded with a stake in misc today tsao is one of the 20largest shareholders in misc
by virtue of his privately-held stake tsao has remained deputy chairmanof misc since the shipping firm's inception he's seen - and done - a lot
for instance tsao and tan sri rama iyer actually researched differentinternational maritime laws to create malaysia's own set of maritime laws
the headache everything had to be translated into bahasa malaysia thatalone took two years' sighs tsao
throughout tsao's tenure at misc there have been various changes atboard level former chairman raja tan sri muhammad alias raja muhammad aliand managing director ariffin alias were the latest to leave when petronasrecently bought out kumpulan wang amanah pencen's 294 per cent stake inmisc at an undisclosed price today petronas president and chiefexecutive officer tan sri mohamad hassan marican is ensconced as chairmanof the national flagbearer while petronas vice-president for marketingdatuk mohamed ali yasin is managing director
will the infusion of new oil-based brains revive misc the nationalshipping company has often been labelled a government company labouringunder stifling layers of bureaucracy says an observer it's top-heavy'thus the petronas invasion may inject a more fluid and relaxed corporatestyle but detractors point out that petronas itself is a statutory body
on top of that being oilmen the new directors may have little expertisein shipping
of course the petronas conundrum may not exist in future if theheavily-rumoured purchase of petronas' misc bloc or certain of itsbusinesses bykonsortium perkapalan bhd kpb actually materialises saysan analyst that option is still open many believe petronas may beholding the misc stake for a third party' alternatively the appointmentof petronas' hassan merican and ali yasin indicates that petronas isn'tletting go of misc
nevertheless some quarters would have preferred kpb's mirzan mahathirat misc's helm because it would have been quite refreshing' kpb peopleare quite young they would have brought in corporate experience' saysthe analyst but despite the prevailing government mindset' at miscthere's no escaping the fact that the company is still basically in goodshape nevertheless earnings growth has been slow bogged down by twoyears of weak industry freight rates in a very competitive industry
misc's saving grace is actually its liquefied natural gas lngdivision which currently contributes 75 per cent of earnings thissubstantial fixed income stream is sourced from a long-term contract withpetronas to ferry the latter's lng until the year 2005 whether misc willretain the petronas contract or not remains open to speculation says ananalyst the uncertainty about the renewal of the contract means that i'mnot willing to call a buy on misc at this point' in addition any renewalmay not feature rates as favourable as in the existing contract sincemisc's five lng tankers are old
but there shouldn't be a drastic change in misc's earnings even if thenew charter contracts aren't as lucrative as before for the year endeddec 31 1996 the lng division contributed rm3799 million to pre-taxprofits of rm5065 million lng should bring in about rm400 million of1997's estimated pre-tax of rm5517 million
since its lng tankers are old and fully depreciated misc's depreciationexpenses are minimal but can the tankers be used for a long time morethe residual life of the tankers is unpredictable because it depends onhow the company treats its ships misc apparently has a programme where itrefurbishes and drydocks its ships for repair
notably petronas has also attempted to control its own freight costs bypurchasing its own lng tankers as of may 1997 petronas had five lngtankers technically says an analyst petronas doesn't have to renew thelng contract with misc' and it would be easy for petronas to becomeentirely self-sufficient in lng freight being very cash-rich petronascould just buy another five tankers - the last french-built tanker thatwas delivered in may 1997 cost rm800 million - and depreciate them veryfast
but there are also other more palatable alternatives for misc versuscomplete independence in lng freighting on petronas' part for instancepetronas could hive off its lng freight division and merge it with misc'slng subsidiary says the analyst in such a scenario misc would lookvery strong'but in tsao's opinion exactly what kind of shape is misc actually insays tsao misc is quite healthy financially it has lots of assets'says an analyst in fact misc would be an attractive addition to anystable of companies any company that takes in misc will improve itsbalance sheet' although it's not exactly cash-rich - as at december 1996it had rm2207 million cash in hand - gearing is pretty minimal for ashipping company but bear in mind says the analyst that misc will beusing its cash for a programme of buying and selling ships' long-termloans were rm1035 million as at dec 31 1996 cashflow is okay with debtcollection within 35 days while creditors are paid after a three-monthcycle
misc is also attractive in the sense that it's undervalued most ofmisc's assets haven't been marked to market value says tsao forinstance the misc land and building is still believed to be booked atcost
theoretically a possible asset revaluation exercise at misc would makethe company very attractive to potential highly-geared raiders assetrevaluations would enable potential gearing at misc to be pumped up inthe event of a takeover the raider's assets could be transferred to misc
misc would then pay cash for the new assets either from existing reservesor via a new gearing exercise
and misc is quite cheap in tune with the downdraft in the rest of themarket based on its nov 6 price of rm610 misc is currently trading at ahistoric price earnings multiple of 128 times fy1996 earnings and aprospective 1175 times fy1997 earnings at market price petronas' miscbloc would sell for less than rm2 billion
end tx ldtan sri frank tsao wen king has a strong streak of sentiment when it comesto shipping his affection is especially pronounced in the case ofmalaysian international shipping corporation misc
currently tsao owns 23 per cent in misc a bloc acquired in1968 thepassion for shipping that runs in his blood means that he has littleintention of surrendering his misc stake although fellow misc compatriotrobert kuok - malaysia's very own sugar king - sold out a long time ago

grace foods bakers of the official bread for the 16th commonwealth gamesbelieves its future is turning golden
walk past the bread shelves in a supermarket and you would probablynotice the wide variety of bread that has popped into the market like hottoast out of a toaster
there is a whole range of bread - from plain white to healthy wheatloaves along with the proliferation of bread in the market a relativelynew player is fast gaining a slice of the bread industry grace foodmalaysia sdn bhd gfm has managed to capture more than 10 per cent ofthe local bread market after less than a year in operation
the bread industry has seen significant changes in recent years whileveteran bread-maker gardenia bakeries sdn bhd could be credited withupgrading the industry in malaysia since its entry into the market in1986 newcomers like grace food indicate the industry is healthilyexpanding
gfm traces its origins back to singapore and its headquarters grace foodinternational pte ltd which holds 100 per cent ownership of gfm gfm inturn holds 100 percent ownership in grace bakers m sdn bhd and gracedistribution m sdn bhd in the region the grace food group isrepresented in singapore and hong kong
gfm first appeared in the malaysian market in october 1996 when it tookover quality bakers m sdn bhd from the australian goodman fielder group
with the takeover came control of the company's existing product brandname high 5 bread since then gfm has steadily gained a foothold in themarket with its high 5 range and since april this year its roman mealrange
the bread market in malaysia is estimated to be worth about rm200million per year net sales of high 5 have doubled the past 12 monthswhile gfm's market share increased from 65 per cent last year to 12 percent this june clearly gfm is set to take on the big players
the roman meal range is produced under licence from roman meal usa
gfm's bakery is the certified bakery of the american premium roman mealbread in malaysia and singapore gfm is currently part of a family of 120bakeries worldwide which produces the roman meal
grace bakers researches develops and bakes its own bread as part ofstringent quality control measures samples are taken monthly from theassembly line as well as randomly from retail shelves in malaysia andsingapore and flown to roman meal usa for testing technicalrepresentatives from roman meal usa also visit the local plants annuallyto recertify the facilities
it is interesting to note that gfm has made a significant enough impacton the industry to earn the title of official bread for the 1998commonwealth games gfm's high 5 nutri-white and its sister product romanmeal have been endorsed by sukom as the official bread of the 16thcommonwealth games this achievement is no mean feat considering the factthat the company has been in the market for only a year
says ham sai kit chief executive officer of gfm to become theofficial bread for sukom '98 means that we have met and surpassed everyrequirement of the sukom '98 committee for a bread of the highest qualitytaste and nutrition'that's how gfm wants its range of bread to be perceived gfm's strategyis to provide consumers with quality bread that is healthy nutritious andis value for money ham believes that the key factors for our successwill lie in the right products at the right price and in the rightplaces'
gfm's target market are consumers who are particular about quality andnutrition according to ham the roman meal range is targeted mainly atthe health conscious as this segment of consumers ranks health highly andperceives price from a value-for-money point of view it appears that gfmis going for niche marketing as the price structure of its roman mealstands at the higher end cutting into gardenia's market
there are four variations of the roman meal and their prices range fromrm230 to rm350 for a 400g to 500g loaf the reason for this price rangeis that gfm uses specially formulated mixes imported from roman meal usain order to give it a distinctive flavour and quality the cost of theimported mix has gone up says ham but adds that gfm is resolute inholding its current bread prices
ham believes that roman meal's popularity will prevail however as thegeneral public is becoming more health conscious and are increasinglydemanding quality and nutrition in food
gfm's distribution system comprises 4000 retail outlets spreadthroughout peninsula malaysia these include supermarkets neighbourhoodshops and 24-hour convenience stores gfm has a 300-strong workforce andoperates two plants in nilai and ipoh these plants have a productioncapacity of some 6000 loaves of bread per hour
ham is optimistic about gfm's future in the local market consumerresponse towards both high 5 and roman meal has been encouraging and salesare increasing ham believes the trend will continue we see our salesper outlet increasing and also the number and geographical spread of ourretail outlets increasing'plans for the future include as increasing gfm's plant capacity andexpanding the company's capacity to cater for a higher demand
sukom '98 might just give gfm the exposure it seeks to promote its''made-in-malaysia brand of quality bread

responding to political parties' demands the newly appointed czech government will lead the country to early elections later this year officials said monday
although the next parliamentary elections aren't scheduled until 2000 the government of premier josef tosovsky will trigger a parliamentary process to cause early elections on june 19
the cabinet appointed on jan 2nd by president vaclav havel was designed as a temporary body following the collapse of premier vaclav klaus' coalition government last nov 30
leaders of the country's main parties met late sunday and agreed elections should take place in the first half of 1998 but differed on constitutional procedure
social democrat opposition leader milos zeman is demanding a constitutional change in order to shorten the legislature's mandate havel and at least two other parties regard such a move as unnecessary
instead the government intends to get at early elections by including a self-destructing formula in its program that will force the president to dissolve the parliament by april 20 resulting in elections two months later
according to the czech constitution if parliament fails to decide on a law within 90 days the president may dissolve it and call early elections within 60 days
the government intends to submit a law on sale of state-owned land to provoke the stalemate leading to the dissolution of the cabinet in order to avoid changing the constitution
this is the government's response to the meeting of parliamentary parties last night minister and government spokesman vladimir mlynar said after an emergency cabinet session on monday
the government will clearly state in its program declaration that this law will not be withdrawn from the agenda mlynar said
but conflict between havel and klaus threaten to jeopardize the procedure klaus was left out of talks for appointing tosovsky's cabinet and his civic democratic party has no official representation in the government
it is therefore possible that some of klaus' deputies in parliament will side with the opposition and sink tosovsky's cabinet
zeman said he will ask his deputies to approve the cabinet only if he finds sufficient guarantees that early elections will indeed take place in june
havel has called a summit meeting of all political leaders for jan 22 in hopes of resolving the issue but more talks are expected among the country's five parliamentary parties before the presidential election on jan 20

han we're gonna take this product and we're gonna sell it to theworld
hitechniaga takes the lead in developing the multimedia super corridor'smaiden internet software
corporations want to buy or license products but not develop and learnabout the product as their business is not in it but in selling thereforeit is not in line with the business to develop these products but it ismore cost effective to buy or license'gordon j bridge president and ceo of connect inclong before the internet hype hit malaysian shores like a hammer fallingto signal the race in embracing information technology it hitechniagasdn bhd was already chug-chugging its slow and steady way to carve a nichein the field of it it started out in systems integration for the unixsystem and eventually found its calling in the digital economy electroniccommerce
in its latest endeavour to show that it indeed does mean businesshitechniaga recently entered into a joint venture with connect inc anamerican company to move into software development and produce a softwareapplication called purchasestreamtm what is unique about purchasestreamtmis that it is the first internet software to be developed in themultimedia super corridor a joint application development between the twocompanies purchasestreamtm was wholly developed at hitechniaga's officesat the bukit jalil technology park and will be locally manufactured andmarketed worldwide
developed to facilitate electronic commerce purchasestreamtm is indeedan apt moniker as it allows enterprises to buy products online targetedat business-to-business commerce online the application automates thepurchase procedure and allows for decentralisation of the purchasingprocess
in an exclusive interview malaysian business met up with hitechniagaand connect at the former's state-of-the-art premises which embodies thequintessential it culture and company if you think of business entitiesthey typically have relationships that they've established with suppliersand they have a procedure that lies typically around purchase orders andapproval processes this is all fairly people-intensive today the costof buying goods represents as much as five per cent of a company's totalrevenue one of purchasestreamtm's objectives is to reduce that cost'explains president and chief executive officer of connect gordon jbridge
purchasestreamtm is the first internet-based product to efficientlymanage the business relationship between buyers and their preferredsuppliers delivering cost savings improving the productivity ofpurchasing professionals and providing better service to internalcustomers it electronically routes the purchase order to the person whohas to authorise the order and also has the ability to track the statusof the order in a nutshell the application eliminates the costlyinternal process of filling up an order and having it routed to differentpeople the application is expected to reduce a company's administrationcost by as much as 15 to 30 per cent
purchasestreamtm was a natural progression from its sister productorderstreamtm an award-winning business-to-business electronic commerceapplication which was developed by connect a little over a year ago
orderstreamtm is now used by companies such as compaq snap-on tools andmoore document solutions both purchasestreamtm and orderstreamtm run onconnect's oneservertm online application platform whereas orderstreamtmis an application where there is a single supplier and multiple buyerspurchasestreamtm caters to a single buyer with multiple suppliers
the strategic initiative to develop this software for business-to-business commerce online bodes well for both companies according to areport by foresster research inc the total value of goods and servicestraded between two companies over the internet will reach us$ 8 billion bythis year and us$ 327 billion in the year 2002 a lot of the things thatare bought and sold are business-oriented the internet as a network forbusiness-to-business communications is where the real money is and thiscould be the real killer application' enthuses hitechniaga's director ofelectronic commerce han k hoh we know that our next growth expansionwill be in electronic commerce'bridge likens purchasestreamtm to a turnkey application wherecustomisation and integration with a company's system operations will beprovided in a full package most of our focus is on extending thefunctionality of both orderstreamtm and purchasestreamtm so we don't havebrand new products' he adds both applications will be able to takeadvantage of new products or new releases as time goes on
work on purchasestreamtm before its launch recently had been ongoing forthe past six months or so as a sign of integration teams from bothcompanies have worked with their counterparts in their respectivecountries visions of bleary-eyed engineers and computer geeks workinginto the wee hours of the morning and then snuggling themselves into theirsleeping bags in the office pop into mind as dr kenneth m ross executivevice-president and development and chief technical officer of connectexplains the intricacies of the design process
ross himself has been in malaysia for the last six weeks or so tooversee the process on our shores the design for purchasestreamtm wasdone in the united states while the actual coding and writing of thesoftware - which ross mentions as the hard part - was performed inmalaysia teams from both companies have been working together for thepast year to bring their baby to birth the partnership between connectand hitechniaga says ross came about due to the belief that hitechniagaand the project's strategy would not only prove a success for bothcompanies but would also in turn potentially sell the application and itsrelated products in this marketplace
in the us marketplace purchasestreamtm will cost enterprises us$100000 or more depending on the size of the company the application'sutilisation how much hardware is needed and the overall demand on thesystem profits from worldwide sales will be attributed to both companiesand revenue from foreign sales is expected to help counterbalance thecountry's trade deficit in software products as the majority of softwareis imported into malaysia
the project is right in line with this year's budget of tightening ourpurse strings as han puts it because of the austerity measures of thebudget the government wants people to save costs and the applicationproduct itself does that they the government want money coming into thecountry it does that because we're gonna share revenues they would likepeople to buy more local products and this product is made in malaysia'ross adds here is at least one early product the result of a localmalaysian company partnering with connect to develop a product that is atangible evidence of what the prime minister has in mind there iseconomic value as well and we did this because we plan on selling thisproduct wherever it is sold there will be royalty payments flowing tohitechniaga' bridge is anticipating the french and scandinavian marketinitially in addition to the us and southeast asian market as connecthas sales agents in these countries
we're gonna take this product and we're gonna sell it to the world'han chips in what we've done here is something which is right at thecore to design and develop an application software'bridge offers an analogy if you look at the us the well-known hightechnology companies such as microsoft oracle and netscape communicationshave one thing in common they are product companies they developsoftware products what hitechniaga is trying to do with the malaysianmarketplace is to become a software development company like microsoft andnetscape' affirms ross to design and develop software is really wherethe most prestigious and most profitable us high technology companiesare'connect and hitechniaga decided to pursue joint application developmentprojects in early 1997 after hitechniaga started work on jaring's mall ofmalaysia which is architected on connect's oneservertm technology
connect is based in california and its entire business is in developingapplication software to be used by major enterprises to buy and sellproducts and services online hitechniaga on the other hand is thepremier systems integrator for electronic commerce in asia both companiesdiscovered they had a similar vision and thus decided to come together forthe purchasestreamtm project
purchasestreamtm is only the first of many more joint applicationdevelopments that both connect and hitechniaga will work on given thepromising outlook of business-to-business commerce hitechniaga'sinnovative initiatives and connect's niche expertise purchasestreamtm andfuture made-in-malaysia it products might just put malaysia on the much-coveted worldwide it map

it was a very bitter and frightening experience for the local stock marketplayers and the public when the kuala lumpur stock exchange klse'sbenchmark the composite index ci fell to below 700 points due to themassive selling pressure by the foreign investors
local billionaires with high loan gearings such as those who used theirshare equity as loan collateral are having sleepless nights and daylight nightmares' some of them will have big problems with the bankswhich sooner or later will excise their legal right to insist that theytop-up' their loan collateral
indirectly the malaysian public through the government will also beforced to top-up' on their own
also some national projects will be delayed because of the problems ofthe klse
the stock market holds the allure of the midas touch an opportunity forindividuals to turn everything they own into gold or to be instantbillionaires it could also have very devastating side effects on thewell-being of human beings in one version of the golden legend when kingmidas was rewarded by dionysus with a wish he wished that all he touchedmight turn to gold but when his food became gold and he nearly starved todeath as a result he realised his error and dionysus then granted him arelease just as in the case of the klse it is important to realise thegolden errors quickly and the rules of the game must be released frombeing a burden to the government and the innocent malaysian public
any change in the rules of the klse should be considered from the pointof determining the optimum size and effective role of the stock market asof aug 29 a total of 681 companies were listed on the klse compared withthe 254 companies that were listed in 1990 after the split between theklse and the stock exchange of singapore however a large number alonedoes not really reflect the quality of the stock market because the recentsharp downturn caused the klse to lose market capitalisation to the tuneof well over rm300 billion
as such the klse should no longer be considered as purely a businessand financial mechanism to tap local or foreign funds it is onlyfavourable for the local company to apply for listing when the stockmarket is booming the klse being a local creation is and must be seen tobe able to fulfill the wishes of the malaysian public rather than totest the midas touch' of individuals it is better for the individuals toimprove the fundamentals' of the companies and then let the publicdecide whether the entrepreneurs have the golden touch or not
the key requirement or indicator for the future listing of any companyon the klse should therefore be analysed on its socio-economiccontributions that require the financial support of the general public
for example new companies which are involved with national projects orhealthcare services should be given ample priority in tapping funds fromthe local stock market even though they are not that financially provento be very sound presently
initially companies owned by the various state economic developmentcorporations sedcs should be encouraged to seek listing so that theburden of the state governments could be widely shared by responsibleinvestors or billionaires
the proposed new rules for listing should also be based on byinvitation only' from the klse rather than by heavy duty applicationsthrough the merchant banks or otherwise the performance and futurepotential of the new company should be reviewed by all the 681 existingcompanies listed on the klse so that there is a better sense of socio-economic understanding and improved long term working and businessrelationships among the local companies senior' companies on boardshould continue playing an important role in ensuring the long termfinancial growth of the klse by determining the qualities of fresh'members
it is hope that there is no conflicting gap in terms of socio-economicand business performance between the various companies that are currentlylisted against those new ones which are being invited to join the klse infuture the emphasis should be on the qualitative aspects rather thanattempting to reach the projected large number of untested companies to belisted as quickly as possible through 681 interviews the potentialcompany will be well known by then to meet the demanding challenges of thebusiness and investment community in this country
the evaluation process should include a question that is still beingdebated - whether there is something unique and sustainable aboutmalaysia's economic miracle or whether it is simply following the west'swell trodden path to maturity disillusionment and decline charles handyan international management guru from britain says i think asia is goingto encounter the same problems as the west the only difference is that itwill encounter them sooner' asian business september 1996 thereforeit is the socio-economic and business responsibility of every companylisted on the klse to ensure that such a negative encounter' does nothappen suddenly in this country it is also for the benefit of everycompany in malaysia to be seriously involved during the processing of theinvitation' of new companies that have' the potential to join the klse
if the ci is claimed to be closely tied to the country's fundamentals'then there is also no further need to divide the listing of the companiesinto the main or second board instead they can be shown only on thetrue board' of the klse

ezekei encouraging research
lasers and fibre optics have wide-ranging applications
lasers and fibre optics are today being used in an increasing number ofapplications
they play key roles in such diverse places such as our homes officeshospitals factories theatres and laboratories they have also helpedcreate many new applications such as bar code readers compact discslaser printers wide-band low loss fibreoptic communication systemsdelicate medical procedures unique sensors of physical acousticmagnetic electric and spectrospic phenomena methods for materials andchemical processing methods for alignment and surveying and numerousdevices for the military
according to dr shaoul ezekei of the massachusetts institute oftechnology mit the possibilities of lasers and fibre optics know nolimits as long as people want to research and explore new potentials alsoknown as ziggy ezekei is a professor in the department of electricalengineering and computer science and the department of aeronautics andastronautics at mit he is also a director of the mit centre for advancedengineering study the professor was in kuala lumpur recently to conducttalks on the fundamentals of lasers fibre optics and photonic sensorsjointly organised by mit malaysia university of science and technologyand sirim bhd
ezekei's research interests are in lasers and fibre optics and theirapplications in atom-field interactions laser spectroscopy opticalfrequency/wavelength standards and sensors he holds several patentsincluding laser gyroscope optical distance measurement and super radiantlight source
ezekei says the tremendous impact of laser and fibre optics has beenseen and proven they vary from diagnostic applications to the removing ofwrinkles actually many people do not realise that the compact disc whichprovides them music needs laser

fibre optics can be applied in homes as well as commercial premises it isdifficult to list them all down applications of laser and fibre opticsbecause they are simply numerous
the power of the fibre optics can be used to check faults or cracks inbridges and buildings there are applications where lasers just provide anidea of solution it is so unique how people develop an application isthrough a better understanding of the need in various fields'ezekei believes in encouraging research you will not know where itwill lead to and the mit welcomes researchers to come over to work withus' he adds he hopes to work with sirim to establish better standards
iraq declared monday it would block arms inspections by an american-led un team renewing iraqi claims that americans were slanting the inspections the challenge threatened a new confrontation with the united nations
the announcement was made on the state-run iraqi news agency which quoted an unidentified official spokesman as saying the presence of too many american inspectors was prolonging the inspections program and delaying removal of curbs on iraq's oil exports
the team is led by american scott ritter a former marine captain who served in the 1991 gulf war iraq has repeatedly criticized ritter claiming he is a spy for the united states
ritter has dismissed the allegation as absolutely untrue
i have never been employed or affiliated with the cia ritter said earlier i find it disturbing and even insulting that iraqi authorities with whom i have worked in the past six years would undertake such tactics
monday's announcement by the iraqi news agency came after ritter and a team of un inspectors visited iraqi government buildings near the headquarters of the un special commission which is responsible for the weapons inspection program
apparently the team was not blocked since the news agency said the ban on inspections by ritter's team would take effect tuesday
it quoted the government spokesman as saying ritter's team included too many americans and britons adding the team will not be allowed to carry out inspections unless it is re-formed in a balanced manner
the official who was not identified by the agency said the team included nine americans five britons a russian and an australian
the iraqi spokesman also accused american weapons inspectors of working against iraq's national interest
they have been falsifying facts inventing lies deliberately prolonging the process and sending false reports to the security council the official iraqi agency quoted the official as saying
the continuation of this situation is unacceptable he added
in new york ewen buchanan a spokesman for the un inspection team said the united nations had not been informed officially of the iraqi decision to block inspections led by ritter
we're trying to find out what this means buchanan said
in washington a national security official said that iraq once again appears to be in clear violation of un demands
it is not for saddam hussein to determine the composition of these inspection teams the official said on condition of anonymity this is a un decision
us president bill clinton returning from a weekend at camp david ignored shouted questions about iraq
the latest challenge comes a week before a scheduled visit to iraq by un chief inspector richard butler an australian to solve outstanding issues related to access to sensitive sites like presidential palaces
in november iraqi leader saddam hussein ordered american inspectors out of the country on the grounds they were spies the united nations then withdrew all of its inspectors in protest and the united states started a military buildup in the gulf that continues to this day
the inspectors were allowed to return a week later under a russian-brokered deal inspections have resumed without confrontation since then although iraq still refuses to allow inspectors into saddam's palaces and other so-called sensitive sites
the united nations has said that trade sanctions imposed on iraq after its 1990 invasion of kuwait will not be lifted until its weapons of mass destruction are eliminated
iraq insists it has destroyed those weapons but the un special commission has accused the iraqi regime of hiding information and materials related to arms production

december 1957 we're expecting ghosts tonight the boys talked about them so much all day that finally i said don't let me hear anyone mention the word ghost' one more time
while we were sitting around this evening a bird flew through the house making quite a commotion syed adanan caught it and put it out
i can imagine what it would sound like in the dead of the night
it was a busy day moving many boys came to help though so the work was made easier for all of us of course some of the helpers' weren't of much help and there were lots of interruptions
i had a long talk with bala this afternoon he wants to stay on as school clerk and i told him we can put him on a full-time basis now that means he'll draw $150 a month which will be quite a boost to the family's financial position
yew kwong who helped us all morning and part of the afternoon - in spite of exams at the catholic high school - came for another visit tonight
he said he would like to live here but doesn't think he can manage fees of $150 a month since his elder sister is the only supporter of the family
it's good to be settled - at least for one year in one place - and i really enjoyed unpacking and arranging my clothes in a real cupboard i've lived out of suitcases for the last five months
even sir gerald ii seems to like his new home
we knew it would happen sooner or later i fairly cringed when i picked up the sunday times and saw the headline school calls in bomoh to end hostel haunting
i went straight to the teacher's hostel to see brian and the other ghosts' and to find out who was responsible for the article
it seems that the bentong reporter for the times who is a sulaiman school teacher visited the hostel last week asked a few questions and got quite a few embellished answers the teachers and boys had no idea he was gathering material for an article
there was a picture of the hostel with the caption this is a view of thehaunted methodist english school hostel in bentong where 14 residents have been terrified by the antics of the ghosts for the last month
the only word in the whole article that was correct was antics i'm afraid this calls for a letter to the editor
the last day of class for the year in form three english i asked what is the masculine version of widow' no one knows then chong kow's hand went up
bachelor' he suggested no no no said i it's widower' then i went on since you brought it up what is the feminine version of bachelor' chong kow again virgin' it's just as well it was the last class we need a holiday
bob lundry was here for the staff meeting this afternoon and the turning-over' ceremony mr wong wasn't present as he's taken leave for a week and i guess it was just as well
it's a good feeling to be back in the harness again
after work i went to the bata shop to buy a kelvinator - on the installment plan $62 a month for 24 months
we found sir gerald ii's body out in the driveway this morning we heard a dog barking in the middle of the night and think they might have gotten into a fight heng thoong feels especially bad because he's the one who put the cat out last night
we got a second-hand radiogram today and tonight we tuned in to the 930 news what luxury yeng kee was over tonight i was dead tired after putting in a long hard day at school so i made use of him by letting him help me plan the games for tomorrow night's geographical society social at school
kam thye and munzir dropped in so yeng kee and i tried out some of the games on them heng thoong and syed adanan we found this is a spoon' a lot of fun - but very confusing
one of mr lem sui weng's dogs was killed behind our house last night by a tiger revenge for sir gerald ii there were over 120 students at the social tonight in the school hall
they were a lot to handle but we got along fairly well
we had to play group games mostly and sometimes it was difficult getting everyone to take part but we struggled through most popular was hangman' surendranath would have carried on indefinitely but finally at about 1030 i said stop
the last day of school is always an unhappy event for some - and today it was unhappy for quite a few
it seems that last year every student in the forms was promoted - whether he passed or not - and that accounted for the general quality of work being done this year
since we're private i see no reason why we should conform to government rules about promotion so we retained all students with an average below 45 per cent and promoted on trial' those from 45 per cent to 49 per cent
it came as quite a shock to several who thought they would be promoted automatically but i did not give an inch - not even for a girl who had a 446 per cent average for third term i would have in her case if her average for the whole year had not been 358 per cent as is always the case several teachers had made errors on the report cards so we had to do some extra figuring before the day was over and we could go home
at our assembly for all the students this morning we announced the scholarship winners for next year and presented prizes for the first three students in each class i was very pleased to see tan gee sin receive the first prize in his class i must write to his father still in prison
shafie failed form one so his father told him he would have to leave school - and home i told him that he could come here to stay and that i would look after him i feel he deserves another chance i think he's going to take me up on the offer
i'm afraid we've disturbed you sir said kamarulzaman as he and ghaffar woke me up late this afternoon yes you have i agreed the boys both failed and they wanted to see if they could be pushed up they could not
many in form two are threatening to leave school if i don't let them go up to form three
abu samah came this morning and said he would leave if i didn't promote him so i said all right and took out the leaving certificate book
wait sir he said i must think about it first
leong ah sui brought his father to see the hostel this morning and alamshah brought his father after lunch they both seemed to approve of the place
i went to see oklahoma tonight with the boys the music was beautiful - what we could hear of it
the sunday times did a rather nice job of clearing up the ghost story
the headline that hostel ghost' was just a joke mr ted miles principal of the school wrote to the sunday times denying the ghost story and pointing out that the school authorities did not call a bomoh
the whole affair he said consisted of harmless pranks being played by certain members of the hostel on other members'
so that's that
this morning i was working at school - along with the remaining teachers and hostel boys - getting the rooms ready for repairing and re-painting when a big new zephyr drove up
it was choo kwai wing - perhaps the most successful materially of all the boys who ever stayed with me he and yap kim hee drove over from kuala lumpur this morning with two friends named tan and chong
they all joined me for lunch and then stayed around most of the afternoon playing games it was so good to see kwai wing again and to see that he has done well since leaving school
we're having the outside of the house painted for $600 and the work was going on while the guests were here inside we're doing the painting ourselves the boys who had a part in the painting today were hamzah zainal abidin bakar zaini kamarulzaman and yew kwong
bakar was the only one who had ever painted before but the others learned quickly and seemed to enjoy it - although they worked long and hard hours
i opened one of my christmas packages from home today which was obviously a record it was the sound track from around the world in 80 days and we've been playing it over and over this evening
another gift we received this evening was a clock - from mr muthucumaru who dropped in to see the house it was certainly nice of him the clock is something we're going to need
two chinese boys from kuala lumpur were at the church service this evening when i heard that they were looking for place to spend the night i told them that we have plenty of room in the boys' hostel so they followed me home
we came through the squeaking doors into a dark house and i led them up the dark stairs into the dark bedroom
people say the house is haunted i remarked casually but i haven't seen any ghosts yet
the boys thanked me for the offer of a place to stay but said they thought they would look elsewhere they left rather quickly

the best total quality management programmes are systematic attempts tobuild company learning in japan the detergents and cosmetics firm kaohas dedicated itself to becoming an industrial university a factory forproducing knowledge
research at the santa fe institute and elsewhere is focusing on thecreative learning process that takes place in what are coming to bethought of as communities of practice' where shared purpose is animportant component of group learning for instance when a suspiciousrank xerox tried to stop its repair technicians spending so much timegossiping in the office rather than on the clients' premises satisfactoryrepair rates plunged what the company had not realised was that thetechnicians had been using their office time to develop scenarios' toexplain copier breakdowns undreamed of by the authors of the repairmanuals

kuala lumpur sat - police arrested more than 40 people who are members of an international syndicate bankrolled by singaporeans and taiwanese and seized more than rm35 million worth of copyright-infringed goods
the two-day operation codenamed ops wayang satu led to the closure of two major manufacturing facilities in kampung baru sungai buloh and taman shamelin cheras and more than 20 distribution outlets including several warehouses in the klang valley
the haul at the end of the day was 680000 pirated compact discs video compact discs and computer software making it the biggest seizure not only in the country since the enforcement of the copyright act 1987 but also in the region
police investigation revealed the syndicate was using malaysia as a manufacturing base not only to meet local demand but also to export the cheap but inferior products to indonesia hong kong taiwan singapore and india
after a tip-off police put into action ops wayang satu keeping surveillance on the sungai buloh factory and tailing the syndicate members as they stocked up their pirated products at the distribution centres in the klang valley for a month
industry sources commended the police action describing it as timely and reflecting the government's commitment and determination to wipe out syndicates involved in the manufacture of goods protected by copyright
the majority of those under detention were malaysians but industry sources said there were several singaporeans believed to be representatives of the singaporean financiers overseeing the operation here ops wayang satu which was only known to a select few among the top brass at the federal police headquarters was carried out on dec 18 and 19 last year
in the first raid on dec 18 police stormed a factory at kampung baru sungai buloh and arrested 16 people including three women
they also seized more than 180000 pirated compact discs video cassette discs video game discs and pornographic tapes and rm15 million worth of machinery including two compact disc duplicating machines and two processing machines
initial police investigation revealed the factory operated round-the-clock with a daily production of 40000 compact discs and video cassette discs
the operator of the factory who is believed to be a foreigner and still at large had raked in rm300 million from the sale of pirated products in the past one year
after questioning the 16 police raided the second factory in taman shamelin cheras the next day and recovered more pirated products
at the same time police teams fanned out and raided about 20 distribution outlets in the klang valley
more than 500000 pirated video cassette discs and compact discs worth about rm20 million were seized from these outlets and 25 people including several singaporeans were detained
the cost of producing a disc is a mere 40 sen but retailers at night markets shopping complexes and five-foot ways sell it for between rm15 and 18 each while the original discs are being marketed for between rm29 and rm39 each
with such a huge profit margin it is not surprising that foreigners are willing to bankroll the factories costing tens of millions of ringgit each said an industry source
he lauded the latest police action as it was a manifestation of the government's determination and resolve to combat both audio and video piracy
among the pirated products seized were top hit movies currently making their rounds in local cineplexes such as titanic and tomorrow never dies
meanwhile sources said federal police had requested the assistance of two foreign computer experts to assist investigation
police internal security and public order deputy director deputy commissioner datuk mohd yusof said who is leading the operation was not available for comment
the haul - 680000 pirates compact discs video compact discs video game discs pornographic tapes and worth more than rm35 million
figures are of pirated copies of compact discs video compact discs video game discs pornographic tapes music cassettes video tapes and computer software seized figures between 1988 and 1993 are not available

communicating bad news is one of the most challenging tasks for
a manager
when relaying undesirable news it is important to create a situation whereyour listeners are receptive the following are some general principle tokeep in mind the next time you are communicating bad news how you say it is as important if not more than what you say so bevery very aware of your non-verbal communication especially as youintroduce the message avoid appearing to be defensive and aloof
if the news is obviously bad do not pretend that it is good ortrivial people can see through the pretentiousness very quickly behonest you'll be surprised to find that people can understand orsympathise with certain situations
try to put yourself in the other person's shoes to see how yourmessage will effect them both emotionally and intellectually it's alsoimportant to understand the psyche of your audience and tailor-make yourmessages to suit them
when people react with anger or frustration do not ignore theirreactions instead acknowledge them and show concern
provide accurate information inaccuracy or a blunder is easilyforgiven when you're delivering good news but not when it's bad news makethe extra effort to provide accurate information and do not be afraid toreiterate your key messages
do not go right into a blaming session you may not be the cause ofthe problem but act professionally
listen writing tips from a t crossremember everything you write is competing for attention so the nexttime you are writing a headline or an opening paragraph use an attentiongrabber an effective grabber is new original and creative it could bein the form of a warning eg read this before you loose 30 per cent ofyour life savings' alternatively you may wish to publicise anopportunity eg we can make your wildest dreams come true'

kuala lumpur sat - an emergency summit of trade union leaders in the financial sector from eight asian countries said many of the policy prescriptions of the international monetary fund are unnecessary and counterproductive
a statement issued at the end of the three-day meeting here said the imf's policies aimed at reducing economic growth raising interest rates and cutting aggregate demand have threatened to severely deflate the economies of the region
this it added could lead to widespread recession the undermining of workers' incomes and living standards loss of employment greater weaknesses in the financial sector reduced export earnings and more business failures
these policies threaten the economic political industrial social and ethnic stability of the region asia
at their worst imf policies can be seen as an attempt to impose upon a country and a region economic and social values which are inappropriate and threaten to undo decades of economic growth social development and ethnic cohesion the statement said
the event which ended yesterday was organised by the international federation of commercial clerical professional and technical employees fiet
the eight countries represented were japan south korea singapore thailand vietnam the philippines indonesia and malaysia
it was hosted by the national union of bank employees
the fiet has about 11 million members from the private sector in more than 400 unions based in 120 countries
the federation is based in geneva
the purpose of the summit was to look into the financial problems in asia
the imf's standardised and intransigent policy approach fails to neither recognise nor understand the economic realities of the region and the causes of the current debt problems it said
the meeting also agreed that the imf's policies needed to be reviewed
these included full transparency of lending arrangements made with any government the protection and promotion of employment economic growth and productive industrial development the development of policies by the imf world bank and the world trade organisation to reform global financial markets to achieve greater stability and to reduce financial volatility and speculation and a re-examination of the imf's role in a global trading environment as called for by the united nations copenhagen summit
on the imf standby agreement for south korea the statement said it would bring a fundamental change to the banking sector with bank closures and widespread restructuring
the standby agreement is oblivious to the social and industrial implications
furthermore there are no provisions to enable the government employers and trade unions to negotiate and agree on the ways and means to implement the various policies for the purpose of minimising social costs the statement said
the gathering also urged the imf not to pressure the south korean government into amending labour laws which could disrupt industrial harmony threaten job security and depress living standards
it said asean's future lies in greater regional co-operation in the economic and social sectors
to achieve this it called for the establishment of an exchange rate mechanism to promote a system of realistically valued exchange rates
this it said would ensure stability promote growth and inter-regional trade and reduce speculation
enhanced co-operation between central banks and regional monetary authorities aimed at stabilising currencies and interest rates controlling inflation and creating employment were also needed
the statement said the establishment of an asean stability and investment fund to complement the role and functions of the imf should also be looked into
to address the economic problems the meeting also called on governments the imf and banks to establish international agreements to roll over short-term debts and to take immediate steps to restructure the short-term debt of financial institutions into medium- and long-term debt arrangements
this is to stabilise the demand for currency and the financial position of the industry
restructure the balance sheets of banks facing problems to move non-performing loans into separate financial accounts
this is to enable these loans and the debt recovery programmes to be effectively managed

nam fatt corporation bhd's bid to diversify its profit stream is getting abig boost from its leisure and property divisions
it has gone into what many feel is a growing industry - night golfing
its two main projects are the kelab golf sultan abdul aziz shah kgsaasin shah alam and the long island golf and country club ligcc in changancounty dongguan in china these projects include residential units
considering that night golfing can be an expensive investment - one holecosts about rm400000 to light up - does it really make commercial senseto go into it in such a big way yes according to datuk jimmy ng kengjoo executive deputy chairman of nam fatt night golfing is practicalfor businessmen as they can enjoy a round of golf without worrying aboutwork at the same time they can entertain clients too it's a wonderfulidea as in a resort like ligcc they can spend quality time during the daywith their families and play golf at night when it's cooler' he saysadding in jest that initially they will have a lot of explaining to do totheir wives about their nightly disappearing acts
kgsaas is being developed by a wholly-owned subsidiary of nam fatt therm500 million resort development comprises a clubhouse a 27-holechampionship golf course lit for night play and residential and commercialparcels covering a total development area of 165 hectares it isscheduled for completion in the year 2000
the success of kgsaas has encouraged nam fatt to venture overseas todevelop other clubs along similar lines the ligcc is an example
developed by dongguan changan jinyu golf club company ltd a joint venturebetween bout holdings ltd hong kong and changan foreign economicdevelopment company china it has an unmistakable touch of nam fatt boutholdings a wholly owned subsidiary of nam fatt holds a 75 per cent stakein the joint venture
ligcc will have a clubhouse and a 27-hole golf course with a 18-holecourse for night golfing a residential development and a hotel theproject which started in 1994 is scheduled for completion in 2000 sofar the clubhouse golfers wing and the golf course have been completed
the development cost - excluding the hotel and property component - isestimated at hk$300 million the total development area is 100 ha
also on the cards of ligcc are plans for a hotel and residential units
nam fatt plans to splash about rm200000 on each room in the four-starhotel considering that the hotel will have 300 rooms it will cost namfatt a hefty rm60 million on the residential side it plans to build low-rise condominiums and bungalows for an additional hk$300 million
why did nam fatt decide on a location like changan says ng althoughchangan is small it is large in terms of a commercial district andindustrial zone entertainment is limited and thus it makes good businesssense to build an exclusive club to cater to the needs of the businesscommunity hong kong with its land shortage is also a big target marketindeed changan offers easy accessibility to budding golf pros it isjust 45 minutes from guangzhou city 35 minutes from hong kong throughhong guan border 20 minutes from the shenzhen airport ferry terminal and35 minutes from lo wu railway station direct access to the club is viathe guangzhou-shenzen superhighway ng's keen business acumen is provingright as busloads of golfers from hong kong can be seen making a beelineat the course as early as friday afternoon for a weekend of golf
how did nam fatt stumble upon this location and a joint venture with thechinese government at that according to ng it came by invitation
besides the people in nam fatt were simply bowled over by the picturesquescenery of the lotus hill which serves as a backdrop to the club he adds
it's quite difficult to imagine that the course was once an orchard andinvestment-wise it's not a bad thing either dongguan has 12000factories and hence the expatriate market is substantial despite the factthat the city already has 30 golf courses
we are planning to add nine more holes to the present 27 and light upan extra nine holes this will make ligcc the only 27-hole course fornight-golfing in china' says a proud ng local expats make up 43 per centof the club's members while hong kong supplies 37 per cent local chinesebusinessmen make up the remaining 20 per cent
was it a challenge to have a government as a local partner a definiteyes says ng it is also a burden because it expects you to be extremelygood in your work it has placed a lot of trust in us due to itsinexperience in building golf courses and you cannot afford to let itdown' he says our commitment to and firm belief in value for money andquality products as shown by our efforts here has earned us the tag of aresponsible malaysian investor'
and the chinese officials appear to be pleased too we are very pleasedwith this joint venture as it will help in the further growth of changan'says changan foreign economic development co general manager and ligccdeputy chairman sun pei wen he adds that the development has not onlycreated jobs for the locals but also benefitted farmers who were paid fortheir land
ligcc is already a revenue earner according to its annual report ligccrecorded a maiden turnover of rm441 million and a pre-tax profit ofrm279 million before minority interest how was ligcc able to generatea profit within a year according to ng this was made possible by namfatt's involvement in the development management and operations of ligcc
we are able to control construction costs as we are well-versed in thedevelopment of golf courses and we have our own management team whichknows how to manage golf courses' he rationalises
club membership fees could have been a contributing factor individualmembership costs hk$ 350000 rm156835 as opposed to kgsaas's fee ofrm70000 which ng considers to be on the low side according to nam fattproperty division managing director ter leong kee membership price may beincreased by hk$ 25000 soon he says after three years of developmentligcc has broken even with hk$ 400 million in sales
nam fatt is on the lookout for interested parties to jointly developmore golf resorts in china preferably in guangzhou or shenzhen in thesouth and also in perth or melbourne in australia
nam fatt reported a group pre-tax profit of rm923 million for the yearended dec 31 1996 up from rm749 million previously this increase waspartly due to the encouraging results from its leisure division where pre-tax profit surged to rm624 million from rm161 million previously
perhaps it is such sterling performance that has made nam fatt confidentof surpassing the rm100 million pre-tax profit mark for its fy 1997
pre-tax profit from nam fatt's property division however increasedonly marginally from rm179 million to rm22 million in 1996 ng remainsupbeat about the property division's ability to contribute substantiallyto the overall growth of nam fatt
things seem to be looking up for nam fatt this year its majorintegrated self-contained township project bandar tasik kesuma in mukimof beranang just three km south of semenyih town and 10 km south ofkajang is expected to generate profits in its financial year ending dec31 1997 nam fatt is developing the project via its acquisition ofproperty developer agenda istimewa sdn bhd the township will bring in aprojected sales revenue of rm2 billion over a 10-year period
how will a slowdown in the property market affect nam fatt according toanalysts nam fatt will not be badly hit as buyers of high-end projectsgenerally would have accumulated enough real wealth to upgrade theirhousing needs
furthermore nam fatt's kgsaas development is at its tail-end whichmeans that the bulk of the units have already been snapped up bandartasik kesuma is a long-term project which has the advantage of a desiredlocation' being in the southern growth corridor the township will be thepreferred choice of those working in the klang valley
says an analyst property equals location and if your location is goodthen you don't have anything to worry about nam fatt has always beenprudent when picking its locations besides projects like bandar tasikkesuma were already doing well when it was bought over' nam fatt's otheradvantage is it has its own in-house contracting and other value-addedservices which are vital to contain cost and ensure supply for long-termdevelopment projects
nam fatt is also studying the viabililty of a rm25 billion project inlong island in phuket if it's found to be viablable nam fatt woulddevelop the project through its 57 per cent owned subsidiary phuket longisland development co ltd

everyone loves a good success story especially when it has been writtenby a well-managed business which produces products everyone needs andwants a brief stroll through matrade's permanent exhibition of malaysianconsumer and industrial products in its ground-floor pkns showroom isample testimony to the strength and quality of malaysia's manufacturingsector there's not much dust on these products
a similar stroll through the telekom museum nearby is more than a niceoccasion for an informative outing with the children it is also testimonyto how malaysian expertise has assembled a reliable key infrastructure ina climate that's anything but helpful
and to be sure business success stories aren't confined to the businesssector ikim isis minds sirim and a host of other acronyms speak verywell of the non-business part of malaysia that turns ideas intoorganisations that work
how do organisations like these stack up against western counterparts
in fact does the idea of comparing them really mean anything isn't thereperhaps a better way to look at things
heads you win does a good job analysing the thinking processes behind asizable array of successful organisations authors quinn spitzer and ronevans address the thinking behind some of today's most success ideas theylook at the logic of constructing a business empire the analytical toolsused to dissect the faults of foes and the opportunities for oneself inthe very first part of the book they set their tonepremise one - critical thinking skills are the foundation on whichorganisational improvement practices rest without an underlyingcompetence in assessing complex situations solving problems makingdecisions and planning for the future an organisation is unlikely toadvance successfully
the great bulk of heads you win is devoted to case-study illustrationsof how the above basic theme works - and in some cases does not work
aside from the fact that all these case studies are enjoyable reading inthemselves - a sort of business person's airplane novel that doesn't boreyou half to death by the third paragraph - what is important is thefeeling of universality in the points they make
in a time when there is way too much being made over the differencesbetween east and west it is time for fair-minded and intelligent peopleto make the much better case for how and why we agree governments mightnot operate much like one other but businesses most certainly do headsyou win is as much a statement of the philosophy of mutual agreement as itis the thinking that makes businesses work
let us take an example one of the major contributions asians have madeto the history of economic ideas is the value-added ladder model ofregional development as country a rises from rung one to rung two forexample from an import substitution to a cheap-labour manufacturingeconomy it turns around and invests in country b which hankers afterdoing the same but doesn't have the skills when country a ascends to thenext rung typically from low-cost manufacturing to an exports-basedeconomy country b follows right along - and then helps country c tooccupy the rung it just left
and so up the ladder they go to the point where singapore has nowachieved developed country status with an advanced technological andinformation economy malaysia is very close behind and our brothers tothe north and south are climbing right along with us it is hard toimagine a better illustration of the prosper thy neighbour' philosophy
now consider author spitzer and evans' learning ladder' on page 28 thebottom rung is knowledge a concept is articulated and rationallysupported' the next rung is understanding the concept's relevance tothe business world is accepted' rung three is skill the concept can beapplied and actions taken' rung four is capability actions can beapplied in a business environment' five is competence actions arerepeated at an acceptable level of performance in a stable environment'
and finally there is six proficiency actions can be taken at aconsistently superior level of performance in a changing environment'
this is in essence the value-added ladder model applied to the businessoffice as an example it is a nice glimpse into why this book can be avaluable read for anyone malaysian business person or otherwise moreimportant it is testimony that the solutions we all seek in an uncertainworld is much more likely to come from business people solving theircommon problems than from any other sector

brazil's and inter milan's star striker ronaldo was expected to be named fifa's player of the year for the second year in a row monday
in an awards ceremony at disneyland paris the 21-year-old would add the coveted trophy to a growing list of awards that he has won over the past year
there were three other candidates ronaldo's brazilian teammate roberto carlos who plays for real madrid dutchman dennis bergkamp of arsenal and frenchman zinedine zidane who plays for juventus turin
national team coaches from more than 120 countries vote for the title
the trophy will be given at a gala banquet in the presence of such great players such as pele franz beckenbauer and sir bobby charlton who were among the initial inductees to the international soccer hall of champions presented by the sport's governing body fifa
beckenbauer whose defending skills help him win a world cup as both a coach and a player gave ringing praise to ronaldo
it's almost impossible to defend against him beckenbauer said he is so fast so skilled and has such a fine technique
there are other fast players but he is very fast and has excellent ball control with it he has the instinct to score goals the german said
ronaldo knows how to score goals especially in france at the all-star match before the world cup draw in marseille ronaldo scored three and easily set up two others
at the confederations cup final in saudi arabia where brazil routed australia he also scored three times
last month he was named the european player of the season after starring at fc barcelona and then transferring to inter milan in a reported dlrs 55 million deal after lazio of rome struggled to also obtain him
he has helped inter to first place and leads the league with 13 goals
ronaldo didn't exactly admit he has his eyes on frenchman's just fontaine's record of 13 goals in a world cup final phrase but ronaldo said with a team like brazil that gives you six or seven chances to score it's possible although the most important thing is to win the world cup
ronaldo said taking the title for 1996 helped him in 1997
winning last year in lisbon motivated me for this year he said i am also young and it's a world cup year this year
his goal-getting skills have drawn frequent comparisons to soccer greats pele diego maradona and johan cruyff
the award ceremony also had the inductees for the international hall of champions which included 10 players two coaches a referee a pioneer real madrid as a club team brazil as a national team a media representative and a person for the good of the game

the market for made-in-sarawak tugboats and express boats is increasing
it may come as a surprise that sarawakian shipbuilding skills have beenquite well-known for many years throughout asia in fact sarawak exportslocally-designed and built tugboats express boats work boats harbourboats and even semi-container and general cargo vessels up to 4000 deadweight tonne dwt
its clients include those from singapore indonesia cambodia vietnampapua new guinea the solomon islands and even china recent new ordershave come from australia and as far away as the united states of america
at home its customers include harbour operators off-shore contractorspassenger ferry operators logging companies and shipping companies
total annual value of orders for shipbuilding alone is conservativelyestimated at between rm100 million and rm200 million marketing isundertaken to reach a wider market this is a good time as many shipownershave found that singapore is getting too expensive even for annual dockingand inspection five singapore shipyards have moved to the nearbyindonesian island of batam where costs are considerably much lower fortheir operations
sarawak's shipbuilding capacity has in recent years been hampered bywhat major industry players say is the lack of proper designated sites forprivate shipbuilding and shiprepairing facilities shipbuilding activitiesare at present concentrated in sibu a riverine town about 100 km upriverfrom the rajang river's estuary in central sarawak
the sarawak industrial development ministry has earmarked a site nearbawang assam near sibu itself for the re-location of the existing 36shipyards in sibu uncertainty over land tenure of the existing sites hasdiscouraged owners from further investing on expansion recentlyindustrial development minister datuk abang johari openg andinfrastructure development minister datuk wong soon koh held a dialoguewith the shipyard owners on the proposed re-location plan
several owners tell malaysian business that the proposed marineindustrial park should provide enough space for everybody it is learntthat the state government plans to open up a site of about 40 hectareswith provision for expansion
moxen shipyard owner wong jin onn is one who is eager to move to the newsite he says the present 35-acre site has become too small and there'shardly any room for expansion moxen a family-owned concern has within a10-year period built more than 130 express boats it also has thedistinction of being the first sarawak shipyard to have built the biggestsemi-container vessel at 4000 dwt to ply within asean waters
wong urges the authorities to get the new park ready as soon as possibleto prevent what he calls lost opportunities' as the market is good nowfor the local shipbuilding industry among the shipbuilding contracts thatmoxen has is to build arguably the biggest passenger boat in sarawak withthe capacity to carry 230 passengers this contract is worth between rm3million and rm4 million
another well-known sibu shipbuilder is deltamarine boat buildingindustry sdn bhd its boss michael k t lau first started the business at ayoung age specialising in marine propulsion before diversifying intoshipbuilding within seven years deltamarine has built no less than 70vessels of various types and sizes with lengths of between 40 feet and 150feet including for export
kiong hong dockyard one of sarawak's oldest builders based in sibu iswell-known for its steel hull tugboats barges and landing crafts
managing director simon wong says we can build just about any type ofvessel provided the facilities are there' its vessels are for the exportmarket and can be found all over the asean region although most of itscustomers are from singapore
another sibu tugboat specialist builder is lau nai hock who owns thenguong mee dockyard located on a 24 hectare site at tanjung maling it isa subsidary of tiong aik s sdn bhd a company that lau and his familyown he gets orders from indonesia papua new guinea and several otherasean countries tugboat building has become tiong aik's trademark for itsgood workmanship and competitive pricing
but he says his company's expansion plans are being thwarted by a lackof space he claims to enjoy a competitive edge regionally in theconstruction of tugboats but he too worries that a lot of marketopportunities will be lost if the industry's growth is limited by the lackof proper infrastructure if the government could act a little faster wewould be able to plan well ahead towards modernising and upgrading thissector of the economy' lau says he however adds that the governmenthas helped in areas like marketing promotion and financing
an indication of the industry's growth is also reflected in the optimismof yong choo kui shipyard it might seek a listing on the kuala lumpurstock exchange five years down the line yong choo kui the company'sprincipal director says the company builds at least 10 tugboats a year
it also builds cargo vessels landing crafts flat-top barges supplyboats fishing trawlers and leisure crafts at the company's two shipyardsfor the local and overseas markets we could have achieved more if notfor land space constraint at our existing site' yong echoes the others
other bigger players in the shipbuilding industry in sibu include wong'sshipbuilding contractor &amp design far east shipyard super-lightshipbuilding contractor rejang maju shipbuilding sapor shipyard andlimbungan cebu
miri in northern sarawak has about a dozen shipyards including thebetter-known ones such as syarikat sarawak slipways bumi armada namcheong dockyard kian juan dockyard and piasau shipyards in kuching thetwo big shipyards are the government-owned brooke dockyard and engineeringworks and a privately-owned ironwood shipyards
according to the sarawak marine department marine engineer bernard markgeikie the growth potential for sarawak's shipbuilding industry istremendous judging by the overseas orders it is getting sarawakshipbuilders have the proven track records the skills the high standardsof workmanship and the long experience to back them up all they need issupport in the form of necessary infrastructure' he says by this hemeans designated sites not only in sibu but also kuching bintulu andmiri
shipbuilding contractor &amp designer boss paul wong says the fall in valueof the malaysian ringgit vis-a-vis the us dollar and other majorcurrencies will inevitably increase shipbuilding costs as raw materialsespecially steel plates imported mainly from belgium and denmark willcost at least 20 to 25 per cent more he adds for the industry to remaincompetitive overseas it is imperative to control costs and increasepoductivity the government ought to provide greater tax incentives andimport exemptions on the necessary imported components for shipbuildingit may come as a surprise that sarawakian shipbuilding skills have beenquite well-known for many years throughout asia in fact sarawak exportslocally-designed and built tugboats express boats work boats harbourboats and even semi-container and general cargo vessels up to 4000 deadweight tonne dwt

pri leaders exhorted prd officials in the federal district government sunday to start governing and to quit using their posts to boost their party
the city demands that people like secretary of government rosario robles stop thinking that she is the spokeswoman of her party said cuauhtemoc gutierrez of the institutional revolutionary party pri at a press conference
we insist that mexico city mayor cuauhtemoc cardenas drops his role as the opposition candidate he should understand his actual role and we will demand that gutierrez also announced the pri would embark on a reorganization of the party which has held mexico's presidency since the 1940s he said the party would modify its 3500 base committees in the federal district
besides gutierrez's comments notimex reported sunday recent anti-prd comments by the pri's city assembly leader manuel aguilera who said the majority party has slowed down discussion in the legislature
in a statement aguilera underlined that lack of interest among the prd's federal district representatives has kept important initiatives from moving to the committee stage
though he asserted the new legislature's first session was positive aguilera said he was not completely satisfied from a legislative point of view
all my colleagues regardless of which party they belong to have to tackle the work legislating
he said
some initiatives he said deserved attention were the creation of an office that would oversee the assembly's administration and the reform of the legislature's internal laws among others
he said legislators ought to take advantage of their political differences and to dedicate themselves to honoring their commitment to mexico city residents deputies were not elected to make forums or pronouncements aguilera added
we should not confuse the executive responsibility which is in good hands with our responsibility to make laws and demand their completion
aguilera also advocated legislators not to use their posts for partisan grandstanding it is not worth it that we should use the assembly for that purpose he said he added citizens can demand that their representatives complete their work because legislation is meant to protect their own livelihood

rural development minister datuk annuar musa yesterday said the rm401 million that were recently taken out of newly-corporatised felcra bhd's funds without the consent of its board of directors and the ministry have yet to be returned
he said this warrants the setting up of a special task force which will involve the treasury and the ministry itself to recover the missing funds
speaking to reporters after giving a two-hour pep talk to some 300 felcra employees in kuala lumpur he said up to today the ministry is still investigating the case involving three felcra senior officers who were alleged to have used the company's funds to set up some companies and to buy shares of a commercial bank in a foreign country
i am disappointed over this because it should never have happened especially without the board of directors' knowledge when we allowed the corporatisation of felcra to go ahead in september this year we had full confidence in its top management and we had prepared a detailed five-year business plan which was approved by the government to assist the company he said
he added that it is wrong to assume that once a government agency becomes corporatised the authority to govern the company automatically falls into the hands of the chief executive officer
that's not true the authority remains with its board of directors he said
annuar said felcra had no business to give an advance of money to any party what more if we used the funds for purposes which are not consented by the board of directors asked whether felcra is making plans to remove its present chief executive officer datuk mustapha juman who has since gone on leave annuar said we will look into this firstly i will get a consensus from the board of directors and then discuss the matter with finance minister datuk seri anwar ibrahim however annuar was quick to add that the ministry is not suggestin that mustapha is involved in the case
i don't want to point fingers let the investigation be carried out in its entirety first he said
meanwhile encik md arif ariffin has been appointed as the acting chief executive officer of felcra and the company has also increased its number of directors on its board to eight from two previously
annuar also said felcra will come up with a new five-year business plan in line with the current financial crisis and the company's financial standings
under the new business plan felcra will have to identify new business opportunities and to revise its original plans in particular those that are no longer suitable due to the present economic situation he said adding that consulting firm price waterhouse has been appointed to help

dnp holdings bhd is aggressively pursuing its ventures in propertydevelopment to add to the coffers of the group this is to compensate thelower margins in its garment manufacturing activities
analysts feel the prospects for the garment industry has been decliningmainly due to higher production and labour costs the sharp decline inmargins are forcing manufacturers to shift operations to countries likeindonesia bangladesh and china where production costs are lower

the group is also concentrating on condominiums and service apartments asa source of rental income
an analyst points out that dnp has mixed property investment amountingto a gross floor area of one million sq ft for rental which is expected togenerate rm350 million over the next five years this means propertydevelopment activities will contribute significantly to group turnover
furthermore the group has an estimated 11 million sq feet of land to bedeveloped over the next five to six years this will result in a largercontribution from its property activities to its turnover' the analystadds
the group's property developments include a mixed development project atplaza dnp in johor baru - a three-in-one building comprising retailoutlets office floors and apartment units priced between rm180000 andrm305000 per unit the project is expected to be completed by 1998 otherprojects include taman nagasari in prai penang and the redevelopment ofwisma dnp at jalan ampang kuala lumpur

according to dnp the contributions from its property development to thegroup's turnover is slated to reach about 50 per cent for the currentfinancial year contributions to the group turnover by its garmentactivities will be reduced to an estimated 30 per cent though propertydevelopment will help dnp diversify its garment manufacturing operationswill go on and continue to contribute a healthy percentage to itsturnover
dnp is a contract manufacturer for international labels such as levi'spolo ralph lauren and esprit about 90 per cent of dnp garments' productsare for the export market mainly to the united states europe and japan
given the niche that dnp's garment division has created for itself in thehigh quality garment market over the years it will continue to havebusiness but the profit margins will be affected by stiff competitionfrom countries where the production cost is low' the analyst says

a 547 per cent-owned member of the public bank group jcg reported netprofit of hk$ 3918 million after tax for the year ended dec 31 1996compared with 1995's hk$ 2731 million and analysts project net profitafter tax at about hk$ 480 million for 1997 what's the secret of jcg
it's simple via its two subsidiaries - wholly-owned jcg finance companyltd and 75 per cent-owned winton holdings bermuda ltd - jcg lends torisky sectors for maximum returns
one such chancy segment is hong kong's low-income population about 30per cent of jcg's loan book is devoted to personal loans to this group
says jcg managing director tan yoke kong we give out unsecured loansbased on a multiple of monthly salary to people with recurring cash flowproblems these include an inability to pay school fees to the need forchinese new year spending money' he tells malaysian business in hongkong
just how much do these proletariat wrestling with cash flow crises make
jcg's targets earn hk$ 15000 or less monthly despite hong kong'saffluence the abyss between the haves and have-nots is vast as at end-1996 an estimated 55 per cent of hong kong households survived on lessthan hk$ 20000 per month although many wage earners hold two jobssimultaneously
swelling the numbers of the hong kong working class are domesticworkers who number about 140000 in the 100-day old chinese sar specialadministrative region apparently some hong kongers see jcg finance as afavourite financier of filipina maids
but tan pooh-poohs this perception we open on sundays to accommodatedomestic workers this is the only day that they can come out andcongregate but this sector doesn't make up a very large part of ourmarket because they earn an average of hk$ 3860 per month we don'tcontrol this segment either since there are other philippine-associatedbanks in hong kong in fact costs of staffing and operating are higherbecause we open five branches jcg finance has 36 branches in totalmaking it the largest deposit-taking company in terms of number ofbranches on sundays'carving out a cheap consumer credit niche is certainly savvy one plus - although many hong kong institutions are stepping up consumer creditlending most prefer to finance the safer' middle-class whoseconstituents earn hk$ 40000 or more monthly but there's menacingcompetition mostly from credit cards which are easily available inshopping-mad hong kong
apart from bank-backed cards it's also easy to get co-branding cards
pertinent examples include the kps credit card offered by a leading hongkong entertainment outlet and a credit card linked to a certain tsim tsashui eatery offering malaysian cuisine to beat the crowd jcg finance iswielding swift service as a weapon
loans are usually assessed and dispersed upon approval in about 30minutes whereas banks take a minimum of 24 hours
has concentrating on cheap credit paid off apparently so jcg finance'sreturns are blistering analysts estimate that jcg finance's gross annualyield in consumer lending exceeds 30 per cent monthly interest chargesare about 25 per cent comparable to credit card rates the flip side
sizzling returns carry red-hot risks jcg finance's non-performing loansnpls were 23 per cent of gross lending in 1996 versus an average of041 per cent for smaller hong kong banks
however an analyst points out that jcg finance's net interest marginwhich exceeds 25 per cent against an average of 333 per cent for thesmaller banks more than compensates for these npl risks' besides jcgfinance's provisioning policy is prudent with total provisions exceedingfive per cent of loans in the end making money in lending boils down togetting the highest returns while paying the cheapest costs
since it's a deposit-taking company dtc jcg finance's access to cheapfunds seems rather restricted says tan banks' funding costs are cheaperthan ours'under hong kong's three-tier financial system licensed bankstheoretically have access to the cheapest funds since they can offersavings and interest-free current accounts restricted licence banksrlbs may offer term deposits up to hk$ 500000 while dtcs can onlyprovide term deposits of hk$ 100000 sans savings and current accountsdtcs are particularly dependent on interbank financing for funds to covertheir loans this dearth of cheap funds is compounded by the hong kongers'mindset on deposits tan says hong kongers don't like term deposits forthem three months is a long time unlike malaysia where people lock inmoney for 60 months'but cheap funds are not a headache for jcg says tan why not becausejcg finance has impressive cash coffers and massive shareholders' fundsjust like its malaysian ultimate holding company the public bank group
jcg finance's balance sheet is enviably robust with a current capitaladequacy ratio of 59 per cent compared to the minimum requirement of 16per cent for dtcs at end-1996 gross cash per share was 70 hk cents
apart from being a cheap way to fund loans its large liquid assets arealso a source of income since its excess funds can earn more via themoney market says tan all along we've been a net lender to theinterbank market'jcg's impressive cash coffers also allow it to fund its real estatemortgages - which comprise 22 per cent of its loan book - and taxi loanscheaply in real estate financing jcg finance charges a floating interestrate - prime plus' and the lowest rate is 06 per cent per month ratesrange from 08 per cent to two per cent' says tan
jcg finance basically provides mortgages for older properties a ratherneglected sector similar to its key low-income consumer credit business
banks are not so interested in older properties' says tan we financeproperties that are 20 years old or more they include walk-up apartmentsof about 300-400 square feet in size in seven or eight-storey buildings
prices range from hk$ 3000 to hk$ 4000 per sq ft you can find theseproperties in mong kok north point on the kowloon side near the kai takareaaverage gross yield on these residential mortgages is 12 per cent sinceit's a relatively low risk sector despite a slowing hong kong propertymarket these areas are still appreciating in value because of possibleredevelopment thus even if loans go sour the underlying value of theproperty more than compensates for jcg's losses
the medium-risk taxi loans business is run via winton holdings a hongkong stock exchange-listed company acquired by jcg in 1996 originallywinton had two businesses - taxi loans and chinese restaurants in thefirst half of 1997 it disposed of four restaurants and stopped operationsat another at an extraordinary loss of hk$ 174 million operating losseson discontinued operations shaved interim pre-tax profit by another hk$91 million to hk$ 2847 million the restaurant business has beensliding over the last three years so during the slowdown we couldn'tfetch a premium' says tan in august 1997 winton sold another fivejoint-venture eateries at a modest premium although these wereprofitable we sold them anyway to concentrate on the taxi financebusiness' explains tan
analysts applauded the move saying that earnings quality should improvesubstantially for winton without the restaurants dragging it down itstaxi business is a booming one with lucrative profit margins
essentially taxi licences are a commodity in hong kong explains tan onelicence inclusive of the vehicle sells for about hk$ 3 million currentlycompared to hk$ 2 million in january 1996
new licences have also been frozen and this should increase demand
apparently the last issue of 300 urban taxi licences was in 1994
currently there are about 15400 urban taxi licences and another 3000new territories licences
in 1996 winton's taxi lending grew at 28-30 per cent with the companycornering about 30 per cent of new taxi transactions this high-pressurepace isn't expected to peter out anytime soon and jcg intends to push itsshare of the taxi financing pie to 30 or 35 per cent since it has a pileof cash jcg can aggressively enlarge its taxi loans without being overlydependent on an increase in deposits
admittedly jcg's attractive prospects and ample assets make it atempting takeover target especially since it's cheaper than other financestocks in good times the price earnings pe multiple was 21 to 22times' says tan at the oct 15 price of hk$ 580 jcg traded at a 1996 pemultiple of 10 times compared to the sector average of 13-15 times jcg'searnings per share is estimated to grow 22 per cent on a cagr cumulativeaverage growth rate basis through 1999 as compared to its peers' 19 percent
despite the lure of lucrative offers tan doubts public bank will selloff jcg a household name in hong kong it is believed that jcg is quite asubstantial earnings contributor among public bank's overseas ventures
overseas operations are believed to contribute about 20 per cent in totalto public bank's overall profits jcg is also thought to be public bank'sfirst overseas venture we built jcg up before we acquired it in 1990it was known as the japan credit guarantee and was owned by an individual
profits at the time of acquisition were only hk$ 35 million then welisted it in 1991 under jcg holdings today profits have grown 10-fold toover hk$ 300 million' says tan
admittedly public bank would reap huge capital gains if it sold jcg
back-of-the envelope calculations place potential revenue from a jcg saleat hk$ 226 billion assuming public bank's 391 million jcg shares aresold at the oct 15 price of hk$ 580 minus costs net gains would beabout hk$ 900 million about rm500 million

hong kong's kai tak airport is straining at the seams
during peak periods airplanes take off and land at the rate of oneevery two minutes on a normal day more than 420 aircraft arrive anddepart each year more than 27 million passengers pass through kai takeasily double the number 10 years ago making it the world's third largestinternational airport in terms of human traffic kai tak is also numberone in non-corporeal cargo handling 145 million tonnes of freight peryear
as of october 1997 the numbers are still swelling with kai tak alreadyat saturation point the april 1998 opening of chek lap kok hong kong'sspanking-new airport won't come a moment too soon number-crunchers haveprojected that first-year traffic at chek lap kok will be in the region of34 million passengers in 2001 more than 40 million people are expectedto tread on chek lap kok tarmac but that's with only the first y-shapedrunway in action with the maximum of two runways and two passengerterminals - the hk$ 995 million rm452 million contract for the second x-shaped runway was awarded in april 1997 to a british-sino-germanconsortium - chek lap kok could be an aviation hub for 87 million people
however chek lap kok isn't a stand-alone project rather it's the cruxin a cluster of 10 interlinked infrastructures see table that make upthe hong kong airport core programme acp this big-ticket infrastructureproject budgeted at an estimated hk$ 1564 billion rm782 billion isbilled as one of the world's largest
more than two-thirds of the funds or hk$ 111 billion rm5045 billionwill be provided by the government either via direct funding or throughequity injections into two statutory bodies the airport authority aaand the mass transit railway corporation mtrc all in all thegovernment is directly responsible for seven of the 10 acp projectsnamely the land reclamations the highways the bridges and phase 1 ofthe new tung chung town - which can house 20000 - near chek lap kok
elsewhere the aa is in charge of building and running the new airportwhereas the mtrc will do ditto for the airport railway
on the other hand private sector participation in the acp takes twoforms one commercial lending for the airport and airport railway twothe awarding of key franchises these encompass airport franchises for aircargo handling aviation fuel supply and aircraft catering andmaintenance as well as the franchise for the western harbour crossinghong kong's third cross-harbour tunnel
as of april 1997 176 major contracts valued at hk$ 9623 billionrm4374 billion had already been awarded to a cross-section ofinternational contractors contrary to popular belief that the britishbolted the bulk of the pickings japan had the lion's share of acpcontracts with 26 per cent of total value followed by hong kong 24 percent the united kingdom 16 per cent and china eight per cent theacp is a truly global undertaking right down to the 3000 importedworkers - necessary in light of hong kong's tight labour supply - andaviation equipment so far everything has been smooth sailing since workon the acp started in 1992 out of the 10 projects eight have beencompleted all on time and within budget' says doris cheung communityrelations assistant director for the new airport projects co-ordinationoffice napco which oversees the implementation of the 10 core projects
but staggering statistics on size and price aren't the only things beingrelentlessly spewed out by the acp there's also the matter of newnational landmarks the acp has spawned new hong kong icons none toosubtly it's hoped that the acp and its novel attractions will boostsagging tourism numbers hong kong's largest services sector says stephenwong assistant public relations manager at the hong kong touristassociation we hope that the new airport will induce people to come sothat 1998 will be a better year for hong kong tourism'to put it mildly 1997 wasn't exactly a bumper year for hong kongtourism one of the most hyperbolic events of the 1990s and hong kong'smost glittery affair of 1997 the july 1 handover to china didn't evengarner a full house flights weren't overbooked and hotels didn't registerone hundred per cent occupancy to make matters worse a recent uproarover the purported overcharging of japanese tourists by hong kong hotelssaw a drastic dip in nipponese arrivals in late 1997
apart from the new airport another much-touted tourist attractionshould be the double-decker lantau link the tsing ma bridge the kap shuiman bridge and the ma wan viaduct make up the 35 km lantau link whichholds rail links as well as roads the topmost deck holds six road laneswhereas the sheltered bottom deck holds two railway tracks and two roadlanes during hong kong's typhoon-prone summers the latter two lanes aremeant for emergency use in severe weather and extreme winds traffic willbe diverted from the upper deck to the lower deck
in actuality the lantau link is a road-and-rail ribbon stretchingacross three islands the tsing ma connects tsing yi island to ma wanisland whereas the kap shui man connects ma wan island to lantau islandsee map the 500-metre ma wan viaduct links the two monumental bridges
billed as the world's longest suspension bridge carrying both road-and-rail traffic the tsing ma was opened by baroness margaret thatcher theformer british prime minister who enthused that the bridge would imprintitself in people's minds as the image of hong kong' undoubtedly thetsing ma will be a standard tourist sight from april 1998 onwards sinceeverybody heading from chek lap kok to hong kong proper must head throughthe lantau link the hoped-for result that the tsing ma will become amust-see feat of engineering akin to paris' eiffel and frisco's goldengate although the kap shui man is shorter it still holds the distinctionof being the world's longest cable-stayed bridge carrying both road andrail traffic
of course tourism isn't the only thing that should get a fillip fromthe launch of the new airport and its attendant infrastructures
government revenues should rise also and offset the elephantineexpenditure already sunk into the acp the opening of chek lap kok shouldsee increased air traffic resulting in extra revenues for the aa
likewise payback time for the mtrc should start in june 1998 when theairport express rail link is scheduled to begin operations cheungestimates that fares for this business-class type service' should beabout hk$ 100 rm4545 for a 23 minute one-way ride from the airport tothe central district in addition there'll be a domestic service thelantau line a mass transit commuter service operating on the same tracksbut with separate platforms from the airport express
but that's not all thanks to the acp land-starved hong kong's propertysupply has swelled via the completed land reclamation projects at westkowloon and central district see table and map says cheung in totalthe acp has reclaimed 1670 hectares of land' in fact the formation of1248 ha of land for the airport platform involved reclaiming 938 ha ofland from the sea and the levelling of chek lap kok and lam chau islands
can't picture it the platform is six km long and four times larger thankai tak on the mainland the mega west kowloon reclamation exercise hasincreased the size of the kowloon peninsular by one-third and caused thewaterfront to jut out further into the harbour by at least one kilometre
apart from reclaimed land hong kong will also be able to redevelop theexisting kai tak site cheung says that kai tak will probably be closedand we'll try to redevelop the site and reclaim the land we'll try tobuild houses and other developments there' the 10 projects in hong kong's airport core programme new airport first runway and associated facilities airport railway lantau link western harbour crossing north lantau expressway route 3 kwai chung and tsing yi sections west kowloon expressway west kowloon reclamation central reclamation phase 1 tung chung new town phase 1as of october 1997 eight of the 10 core projects had been completedexcept for the new chek lap kok airport and the airport railway dorischeung assistant director of community relations new airport projectsco-ordination office says that as of end-august 1997 the new airport was89 per cent finished and the airport railway 86 per cent complete

the move by the group of 15 g-15 developing countries to come up with adraft set of rules to regulate currency trading is indeed unprecedented
this will undoubtedly be welcomed by all countries which support fair andequitable trade
the task is challenging and timely given the recent turmoil in theworld stock markets due to reckless manipulation of the currencies ofsoutheast asian nations
it has made the rest of the world wake up to reality markets do notoperate in isolation neither are they independent of each other indeedthe link between currency and equity markets or asian and western marketsis not too distant
unfortunately manipulators seldom realise the folly of their ways theywill never give up but can be controlled more importantly it takespolitical will by all countries concerned to stamp out this menace
thankfully something is being done it is sad that it has taken a majorshake-up in the world's stock markets to nudge the west into action
it is noteworthy that the united states japan and the internationalmonetary fund imf have agreed in principle to set up a new mechanism tohelp stabilise asian financial markets reports say the mechanism willincorporate a japanese-mooted idea to create a fund for financial crisisin asia
but comments by the united states' deputy secretary of state strobetalbott reveal that the us is not convinced of the need for an asia fundas it feels the imf is the proper body to tackle such crises
talbott's comments are strange given that the us supports the moves tostabilise asian financials markets won't the setting up of an asia fundcomplement the efforts of the imf and will it not lead to greaterfinancial stability
the north the us in particular should be more sincere in its offers ofassistance to the south attaching terms and conditions only serve tocontradict and confuse
perhaps more north nations should emulate france's call for closercooperation between the g-15 and european union nations
although it may take some effort by both parties it will lead to abetter understanding of each other's views and problems

a basketball court sits a tad awkwardly in a cul-de-sac in ilaw ng nayon street manila where the maddening squeeze of jeepneys cars and buses seems to have trickled off suddenly
the smell of tamarind that once wafted over this sprawling sampaloc area is gone amidst the haphazard clusters of tall narrow buildings lies inobtrusively an emerald palace' - there will be one more in a grander contemporary design just next door
this is the dream glass' factory of ramon orlina whose midas touch has been transforming dull chunks of waste glass into sculptural sensations
orlina's mock-crystalline marvels not only adorn interiors of private homes and major corporations but also popular public spaces all over asia though his influence has spread much further - to as far as monte carlo france praque czechoslovakia the fount of studio glass and seattle the united states
his monumental masterpieces include the dignified elegance of his quintessence the 75-square-feet glass-and-bronze window installation in the singapore art museum 1995-96 the 8-metre high oneness a sculpture of glass steel and concrete at the roxas boulevard in manila which was part of the sixth asean square sculpture symposium in 1989 but which was recently removed to a better home' in front of the cultural centre of the philippines and the eight-storey high wings of victory metal sculpture comprising 671 metre-length birds in flight at wisma atria shopping complex in singapore 1985-86
his glass sculptures exude an illusion of precious stones crafted into heroic narratives or alluring symbols - the geometric and angular with interplanary interlocking and interpenetrating forms or the more mesmerising curvilinear concoctions both types harnessing the intriguing play of light
reflected refracted even deflected - the light assumes a sensuous and even at times sublime glow as it caresses and glides across a cascading plane perhaps a curvaceous mound a prismatic twist or an abrupt crevice or void
internally the light meanders ricochet and even suffuses the inner sanctums to reveal certain subterranean wonders in a commission for the san miguel corporation he even uses fibre optics lighting to give the work a kaleidoscope of changing moods
orlina is a phenomenon there is nothing like what he has done - from the cosy studio glass workshops of czechoslovakia to the murano furnaces of italy and the glass-blowing hotbeds of seattle
even swarovski the chic crystal house from austria paid the highest homage to this maestro by letting him work on some of its beautiful lead crystal blocks
the amazing transformations along more classical lines went on show at the grand hyatt in hong kong in a special exhibition in june 1993
the 53-year-old has an exalted place in the world of studio-glass' sculpture for his unique cold technique which he has honed to near perfection the conventional methods use hot molten technique or the moulding format
it all began when he painted on glass in 1975 for his first solo which was held at the hyatt regency in manila and repeated in another solo at the citibank centre the next year
it was in 1976 that his art career got off to a fairy-tale start when the president of the republic glass corporation in pasig victor a lim offered him access to the sheet-glass cullets the leftover glass sediments at the pit of the furnace after production
these materials with a natural green sheen are used to make the windscreen and windows of cars he says
when orlina decided to give up his architecture practice of 10 years to pursue his childhood dream of becoming an artist he startled his fellow professionals
there were friendly taunts at first but as orlina began winning awards and fame and more awards and more fame the rib-poking turns into astonishment and awe
his architecture training bachelor of science in architecture santo tomas university is not lost but is to stand him in good stead
as he puts it my training helps me to deal with the technicalities and the chemical properties it's a combination of instinct and science
he cited his oneness sculpture which would have tilted like the leaning tower of pisa had he not insisted on a stronger foundation because of the soft soil structure as it was built on reclaimed land
orlina conceded that making the switch-over from architect to artist was not a difficult thing though he was making good money as he came from a well-to-do family his father was a harbour pilot and needn't have to work terribly hard for a living
but tough it certainly is
orlina has to start everything virtually from scratch improvising and augmenting his technique as he went along
the initial process of extracting the glass from the pit of the closed down furnace is a back-breaking task
i do it myself with a jackhammer the furnace is so big some 150 square metres it's like a road paved with glass said orlina when interviewed in his new multi-tiered workshop cum studio building which was in the final stages of completion
in a large compound in what was originally designated for his garden are boulder-heaps of cullets the bigger ones weighing up to 250kg - like a krptonite mountain of superman comicdom the new building which he designed himself is planned for optimum use of space yet without any sense of claustrophobia and with a safe airiness there is a special ramp that leads to his house in another lot where he stays with his malaysian-born wife lay ann a lawyer by training and three children
in an art-making that requires a lot of space a little more capital-intensive and certainly more labour-intensive orlina has a trusted band of skilled workers to help cut down his production time of cutting grinding sculpting and polishing
there is another peripheral group who does the more menial chores
it is also a process that requires a lot more power and so the electrical poles nearby are fitted with special boosters
i don't do sketches i look at the glass and work directly on it putting in pencil marks here and there for the places to be cut off if there are big parts to be lopped off my assistants cut them off he says
the grinding can take them a week or two each time
orlina shows an innate affinity with the glass blocks as he surveys them and works clinically and instinctively to bring out their pristine intrinsic quality
the blocks are constantly sprayed with water to reveal their other facets and also as a safety precaution because the dangerous silica emissions could be detrimental to the lungs
the glass also has to be treated with hydrochloric acid first he says
through accidents and ingenuity orlina has built up an astonishing repertoire that is reminiscent of the curves and cuts of hepworth moore and arp and even cubistic distortions ala picasso
from the more sedate multi-faceted intertwined/interspersed naesa that's asean spelt backwards chiaroscuro of 1988 orlina's oeuvre assumes more erotic overtones in his ning-ning series that does for women's torsos what michelangelo did with his renaissance chippendales with the emphasis on breasts in a rite of fertility and celebrating the feminine mystique
in the early 1990s there is also the appropriations to telling effect of the moore hollows in transcending space he also uses the straited textures as counterpoints to the overly polished the opaque against the transparent and on a few occasions the trapped minute bubbles as adorning elements
in a newer series orlina goes into mock-rubic cube conundrums where wedged-shaped blocks of sculptured stellas with intriguing chips and runnels can be joined together like lego blocklets
orlina is also a beacon of light to filipino artists having headed the powerful artists association of the philippines for several terms and more recently mobilised the aap to organise a successful charity auction of philippines art in co-operation with christie's
there seems no end to the infinite possibilities that orlina's imagination and inventiveness could bring into his glass sculptures either by itself or in tandem with other media
such is the effervescent quality of his art and his personality

only rina drummer and tan li chu bassist were with leilaton as vocalist-guitarist tengku nora ashikin tengku nazaruddin and replacement bassist lim poi kim had classes that day tan has since left for further studies abroad but she is still very much a part of the group what rina was trying to say was that the band is more towards rock than alternative singing self-penned songs about funny weird things - a pussycat that got run over by a steamroller a magical japanese-speaking cat a cartoon character with blue skin one of their songs includes a punk version of an old favourite nursery rhyme
but to the press and their fans they are definitely a grungey alternative outfit with influences of 1960s punk-pop
in fact it was rina who offered that bit of information on the band's sound in an interview following the band's first signing by positive tone they launched a compilation album boys &amp girls 1+13 last year
intoxicated contributed three songs to the compilation kitty kat the flattened-cat song doreamon the japanese-speaking cat song and diet about the dangers of dieting
also appearing were soloist nita female duo brodwyn and boy bands oag old automatic garbage and nice stupid playground
the album the brainchild of positive tone's resident producer paul moss former member of the defunct new zealand band the fan club headed by local singer aishah was just a fun project to give school-going talents an outlet to express themselves
but the album won best english album at the anugerah industri muzik '97 awards and brought the boys and girls instant acknowledgement
with that came demands for more resulting in the group's first ep to be released this march which the girls claim will display their new sound - more rhythmic and melodic yes their wacky lyrics have been retained
the six-song ep titled catastrophe contains diet and a melayu version
of kitty kat now titled kucingku aki
the other tracks are i love about an obssession with baked beans mary a punk version of mary had a little lamb brainy smurf a track inspired by cartoon characters smurfs and possibility about unrequited love the only ballad in the ep and the first song with rina on lead vocals
why catastrophe if you haven't guessed it is because the girls are nuts about cats and the word starts with just that
rina said catastrophe was an experimental album to test the market for a possible full album
since the members are also college-going 20-year-olds studies therefore come first so it was with a heavy heart that tan left for melbourne australia early last year to do civil engineering
very soon rina will leave to pursue a degree in mass communications at stamford college in buffalo the united states
looks like the remaining members - nora doing business infomation technology at inti college and lim chemical engineering at taylor's college - will hold the fort till nora goes to britain for her final examinations
then we'll see what happens according to leilaton positive tone will continue to market the band
rina nora and tan first jammed together four years ago when they were in form three at sekolah menengah perempuan sri aman in petaling jaya
they went on to play at school functions before going into recording
now you see them on tv and in the papers and magazines not bad for a bunch of girls who only wanted to have a good time copyright 1998 new straits times all rights reserved as distributed by worldsources online inc

businessmen demanded an exemplary punishment against claudia campuzano the federal district judge who freed five men who confessed to killing a us executive in december
gerardo aranda orozco president of the mexican employers confederation coparmex said it was shameful that the justice system allows aberrations such as the judge's action
canaco president jose alfredo santos asseo said all people should insist in the application of the rule of law and in the reform of judicial power which is crucial to mexico's development
in an interview with government news agency notimex he said campuzano's attitude inhibits and frightens away investors because decisions like hers do not guarantee security he urged the government to recapture alfonso gonzalez sanchez the accused triggerman and four alleged accomplices who were arrested in the killing of us executive peter zarate in december that dangerous band has also affected the businesses of this country santos asseo said
textile industry leader tito kuri said he worried about an attitude of impunity concerning the judge's decision and said the system of complicity and corruption within the judicial branch should be broken
leaders of the conservative national action party also urged changes in the judicial branch following campuzano's decision in a statement party president gonzalo altamirano dimas said the national judiciary council of the superior judicial tribunal should reveal its findings on the case quickly to restore confidence in the judicial system
the council is to determine if the freeing of alfonso gonzalez sanchez known as el chucky and the four other men was an irresponsible act made by the judge or whether it came about from illegal actions made by police or prosecutors
there is an urgency to finish with the impunity of political functionaries that in many occasions force confessions and also with dishonest or irresponsible judges that free criminals with the argument that they lack evidence to try them altamirano said

mention lewis pragasam and you immediately picture drums - lots of them
those growing up in the 70s might remember him as the person who provided the beat to singers and musicians on rtm entertainment programmes occasionally there'd be special segmants in such shows where pragasam and his sparring partner in orkestra rtm tabla-player extraordinaire v anggapan would engage in an intense repartee on their respective instruments
the duel between the two was among the highlights of such programmes those days and their skilful display would usually bring the house down
in 1980 pragasam was seen on the cover of revolvers' first album becoming part of the band's giant hit perpisahan
however he did not stick with the group but moved on to start a brilliant project called asiabeat its first album released under the cbs jazz adventure series this was long before cbs was bought over by sony saw him collaborating with musicians and percussionists from around the region including sakuhachi player john kaizan neptune
that adventure did not stop and the asiabeat project continued with several more recordings that gave pragasam a more credible name
now after spending years in the region particularly southeast asia studying learning and documenting its traditional musical intruments - especially percussions and drums - pragasam has taken another step to spread his interest to the people two weeks ago his first book gendang-gending malay rhythm heritage published with the aim of exploring and preserving the rich historical past of malay percussion was launched
no i am not an authority in this field neither am i a scholar - that's not part of the whole idea anyway drums have been my passion for as long as i can remember
what i want to do is share with people my interest and the things that i discover over the years believe me the region especially our country is rich in discoveries and heritage  pragasam said after the launch
published by iris communication sdn bhd the book is touted as the first in-depth documentation of malay percussive instruments and traditional music best of all it comes with an interactive cd-rom which provides sounds and visuals of malay percussive instruments
the idea was with me for quite a while while the materials were part of my studies over the years so when i was given the chance to come out with a book getting everything together took only some six months
we try not to be too technical about the whole thing it has to be friendly' to readers the book discusses the history of the instruments show the relationship of the drums to the culture as well as the more technical aspects like how the instruments are made
pragasam said understanding traditional malay rhythm instruments is tracing the history and culture of the malay people and the influences the society has absorbed for instance there are instruments similar to those from the middle east india and thailand - an indication of the assimilation that took place in the early days
pragasam hopes the 200-page book and accompanying cd-rom could be a good reference for music enthusiasts students musicians and ultimately the masses
in conjunction with the launch pragasam staged a concert at the panggung eksperimen kuala lumpur which gave a hint of what the book was all about
joining him that night were good friends michael veerapen casey josie thomas kirubakaran and mark david as well as a gendang troupe from kelantan and a group of orang asli musicians and dancers two pop names - ramli sarip and liza aziz - also lent their voices that evening
we plan to have more of such events and concerts currently we are working on having a world percussion festival that could introduce malaysian instruments to outsiders
if everything works out we'll have it by august - before the commonwealth games pragasam said
gendang-gending malay rhythm heritage is expected to be in the bookshops by the first quarter of the year
crews worked to contain an oil spill off the northern emirate of umm al quwain on monday and expressed fears that wind would carry it to neighboring dubai and sharjah
a barge spilled 4000 tons 28000 barrels of fuel oil into the gulf on wednesday after it ran aground in rough seas
the gulf news reported monday that a team of six divers will try to seal holes in the sunken barge to staunch the leaks
environmental experts also have been called in since the spill threatens marine and plant life along the coast
the english-language paper said there was concern that winds were pushing the spilled oil south toward the emirates of sharjah and dubai
the abu dhabi national oil company sent four 30-ton skimmers to help with the cleanup the english-language paper said
the oil slick already has killed millions of fish larvae in umm al quwain and is threatening thousands of mangrove trees dead fish crabs and other marine animals have washed ashore over the last few days
the barge which came from iran was not built for transporting oil emirates officials said

rawang sat - commercial goat breeding can be made a profitable venture in the country with the one million hectares of idle land available a farm manager said today
k muthu who is also the maju goat farming and trading sdn bhd managing director said mass production of goat's milk which has the potential to fetch a price of rm20 per litre was an area worth considering for those interested to venture into the dairy industry
the rarity of the product explains why it is so expensive it is common for a 250ml bottle of goat's milk to be sold at between rm4 and rm6
if we are able to produce the milk on a large scale the price can be brought down to a more affordable level he told the new sunday times at his farm in km31 jalan rawang batang berjuntai selangor yesterday
the 35-year-old former butcher who has 20 years of experience in goat breeding said financial constraint was the biggest challenge for him and his partner n ravindran in their quest to expand their farm
we have to rely solely on mortgaging our property to obtain bank loans he said adding that their loan application was made difficult since their land was a temporary occupation land
at present muthu said the six-hectare farm has the capacity to produce an average of 50 litres of goat's milk daily
started seven years ago with an initial capital of rm200000 the farm has 150 goats which are imported from australia new zealand and south africa
a much sought after item goat milk is reputed to have healing qualities for both the young and old against jaundice stomach ulcer hepatitis b sickness caused by liver failure cancer detected at early stage skin problems and asthma
goat's milk is only second best to mother's milk
low in cholestrol and tastes better than cow's milk goat's milk does not disrupt the digestive system of infants he said adding that goat's milk should be best consumed in its natural state
we also use our own formula to make the milk a little concentrated by feeding our goats with hay and our very own feeding formula which has local herbs content to get rid of the smell present in goat's milk he added
the farm's marketing manager n ravindran said the company was willing to enter into partnership with local dairy-based product manufacturers
this will help us to widen our market network
recently we have been approached by the university hospital and the paediatric institute to supply goat milk to patients he added

thousands of citizens are expected to swarm mexico city's main thoroughfare monday afternoon in a march protesting the government's handling of the conflict in chiapas
posters announcing the march - sponsored by the federal district civic alliance - line avendia de la reforma where protesters will gather at the angel of the independence and march to the zocalo
volunteers in city parks also handed out flyers advertising the march on sunday
the least we can do as mexicans is refuse to remain silent about what is happening in chiapas
said an event organizer handing out flyers in parque de mexico
the pamphlet demands an end to crimes against the indigenous population of chiapas and government compliance of the san andres larrainzar accords
only organized citizens can put a halt to the abuses the impunity and the chaos that prevails in chiapas read the pamphlet
members of the zapatista national liberation front fzln - zapatista sympathizers who reject the use of arms - occupied the angel shortly after the dec 22 massacre of 45 indians in acteal chiapas
on sunday the angel witnessed declarations of solitude for the stricken in chiapas by members of the federal district legislative assembly aldf and a group of americans who visited the southeastern state
three party of the democratic revolution prd assemblymen ernesto chavez vicente cuellar and francisco ortiz read a statement showing the support and solidarity of prd legislators for the indigenous cause and our disgust at what has occurred in chiapas
we demand the government authorities conduct a thorough investigation of the acteal massacre and apply the strictest measure of the law to its intellectual authors as well as the men who carried it out
the asambleistas said
marti batres guadarrama head of the prd's ruling aldf faction who attended an inauguration instead of his scheduled visit to the angel said prd assemblyman have a responsibility to be sensitive and respond to incidents such as the acteal massacre
if 45 men women and children are killed we will protest express our indignation and repudiate that act he said we are not insensitive we are human beings
a group of six americans who recently toured chiapas spoke about what they saw and pledged to make sure the acteal massacre remains an isolated incident
phil wheaton an episcopal minister from washington dc said the group had observed thousands of homeless as well as the mexican army using american military equipment
we saw hum-vees tanks and arms that were sent to mexico by the united states government to fight the war on drugs he said but that equipment was in the care of the mexican army in chiapas where drug trafficking is not a problem
wheaton said he will report to the us government the lack of peace and justice in chiapas and added that he will lead a protest on monday in front of the mexican embassy in washington dc
a demonstration corresponding to monday's angel-to-zocalo march is also planned in los angeles

it's that time of the year again - a time to reflect past achievements and to set new or implement previously planned goals
however i will not delve on past achievements you can do that yourself if you're interested but look at the things we will be doing this year - from the information technology it perspective of course when we mention it without a doubt the one thing that will always creep into conversations is the multimedia super corridor msc
it made up much of the highlight last year but all that was focused on selling the msc idea and laying out the foundation
this year the msc will move to the next phase in its fulfilment as the end of 1997 marked the end of the honeymoon period
much of the selling and marketing efforts done most of last year will have to solidify this year
it's time to roll up your sleeves and get those hands dirty thus without a doubt this year can perhaps be labelled as the year of the msc
the most important and perhaps critical event in the msc calendar this year is the second meeting of the international advisory panel iap
there is no denying that the economic and currency turmoil currently blanketing the region has somewhat dampened the international passion shown towards the msc
even before the currentproblems we already saw that other countries have stolen the msc thunder from us india for example got a huge notch on its it belt when software giant microsoft announced that it planned to set up the company's first software development centre outside the united states in that country
even the philippines managed to grab some headlines when it became the first international participant of the us$50 million rm225 million oracle academic initiative oai part of oracle education oai is chartered to provide academic institutions worldwide to further expand technology education programmes
this year even more efforts need to be in place if we want to hold world attention towards the msc
although the government has expressed its unequivocal commitment towards the msc even in the midst of the turmoil the acid test to use in order to gauge worldwide interest towards the msc is the next iap meeting
comprising practically all the who's who of the it universe the iap is set to meet in kuala lumpur in the next couple of months in the middle of next month probably
there are actually two things to keep a close eye on related to this meeting - the attendees and what will come out of the meeting in its inaugural meeting in san francisco last year majority of the iap members managed to show up however the most noticeable absentee from that meeting was of course microsoft's chief executive officer bill gates who opted instead to have a private discussion with the prime minister
this year it will be a great coup indeed if all the 34 iap members including gates the de facto ruler of the it universe will sit and talk constructively together around the same table
imagine if gates attends this year's iap meeting he will be sitting and working together with the same people responsible for many of today's microsoft-bashing propaganda interesting indeed the support of all iap members shown by attending this year's meeting will at the very least help rejuvenate some of the faded appeal of the msc both local and internationally due to the current situation
the second iap meeting is also important as after about a year of digesting the concept unveiled during the first meet it is time for its esteemed members to live up to their reputation set oversized egos aside and put their innovative brains to work
if we are successful in doing that it should not be too much to expect that something compelling will come out from the meeting - some sort of a keystone declaration that will cement everything in place
as this year will also see a commencement of number of pilot projects for the seven flagship applications see figure 1 this meeting can also be a platform to benchmark the various work done
it can be used to iron out glitches encountered thus far in the implementation and making sure that these bugs will not creep up in later stages
with kuala lumpur as the venue iap members will have the rare chance to look at the msc first hand and get the feel out of the place - there's nothing more effective in getting people to buy in a concept getting iap members to the msc will give us the opportunity to showcase that it is not just talk but an actual commitment with both a physical and non- physical infrastructure attached
all these of course will only work if we can get a respectable number of iap members here

tenaga nasional bhd tenaga is to defer about 60 non-essential power transmission and distribution projects worth some rm3 billion over the next few years in view of the current economic situation
at this point we are looking at the transmission projects which we think of as nice to have but if constrained by resources we can defer them said tenaga's executive chairman datuk dr ahmad tajuddin ali
some of the projects include upgrades and those that would have operated in tandem with the now deferred bakun hydro-electric dam
the largest project to be deferred will be the rm1 billion transmission line linking tanjung sedili yong peng and bukit batu in johor that would have carried 1800mw of electricity from bakun
fluctuation in exchange rates also poses a problem to ongoing projects like the 2000mw janamanjung coal-fired plant near lumut which is in the final process of firming up the engineering procurement and construction contract
tenaga expects a rm10 billion turnover for its 1997/98 financial year but profits said tajuddin will depend on the ringgit's performance against the us dollar
demand for electricity is now expected to grow at 8-9 per cent next year compared to an earlier forecast of 13-14 per cent
if the ringgit strengthens to rm292 we will be ok if it is rm320 it will still be manageable but if it remains at rm394 then it will be another rm15 billion to rm2 billion in translation loss said tajuddin after tenaga's seventh annual general meeting in kuala lumpur yesterday
because of the weaker ringgit tenaga posted a foreign exchange translation loss of rm128 billion for its financial year ended august 31 1997
tajuddin said tenaga is not expecting any major reduction in revenue stressing that the cash stream is fairly solid
cash flow of the company if we can control operating expenditure should be ok commenting on the downgrading of tenaga's senior unsecured rating by moody's investors' service following the lowering of the malaysian sovereign ceiling foreign currency debt rating tajuddin said as far as tenaga is concerned it is an automatic revision and not specifically aimed at the company
however it means that it now makes more sense for tenaga to raise funds locally he said
we are thinking of raising more funds but will look at direct loans from local financial institutions asked to comment on the need to reduce costs and tenaga's power purchase agreements ppas with the independent power producers ipps tajuddin said there are ways that the ipps can help but tenaga would leave it to them to consider how this can be done
describing the ppas as something we have to live with tajuddin said if demand slackens and not all the capacity available is required then the ppas will be something that could be looked at
but this is not something that is for me to say because it is an agreement that was signed however from the point of view of everybody having to do something for the nation this is an area that perhaps can be looked at tenaga currently purchases some rm33 billion worth of electricity a year from the ipps equivalent to about one third of its operating cost and 38 per cent of its power generation the ppas do not provide for a reduction in payment if demand drops
tajuddin had earlier answered questions from shareholders about the current economic situation and how tenaga would strengthen its position and help buoy its share price
we will do what is right for the company and the rest will follow
what is right for the company is to enhance its position particularly in the delivery of the product that the company is supposed to deliver which is a reliable supply of electricity and good customer service although it remains committed to enhancing its system tajuddin said tenaga is nevertheless carefully managing its capital expenditure in view of an anticipated slower rate of demand growth
cost-cutting measures being undertaken company-wide include using more local content and services where available and maximising the use of gas as the cost is fixed and supply if plentiful locally
tx among the projects that will be deferred 500 kv transmission line linking tanjung sedili yong peng and bukit batu in johor - rm1 billion 132 kv sub-station in ujong pasir malacca - rm22 million 275 kv underground transmission cable in kuala lumpur - rm30 million 132 kv underground transmission in kuala lumpur - rm20 million 275 kv overhead transmission line in perak - rm60 million 132 kv distribution sub-station in lembah beringin - rm25 million
russian stocks fell 14 percent monday to hit their lowest level in 10 months as foreign investors shaken by a new wave of losses in asia and the united states pulled out of the russian market
the sharp drop caused regulators to suspend trading an hour before monday's close the session resumed a half hour later for the final 30 minutes of trading
it was the first time trading had been suspended since oct 28 when the world market crisis began having an impact on the russian market the market finished at its lowest level since march 7 1997
russian government bonds also were down and the ruble slipped against the us dollar
dmitry kryukov senior trader at renaissance capital in moscow said big investors were selling aggressively throughout the day the selling was sparked by the renewed weakness of asian markets and the fall of the us market on friday
investors also have been unusually sensitive he said because of potentially troubling factors within russia including uncertainty surrounding the health of president boris yeltsin who was hospitalized last month with a bad cold and is now away on vacation
but kryukov noted that some large investment funds began looking for bargains late in the session and the trader said he expected stocks to rebound
trading he said focused mostly on blue-chip issues all of which were sharply lower
oil giant lukoil was at dlrs 1820 down from dlrs 2102 friday electric utility ues fell to 2394 cents from 2795 cents friday
russia's finances already took a beating from the international market crisis last fall when stocks plummeted many foreign investors pulled out and the central bank intervened to steady the ruble

as the country digs in to face a regional economic malaise a new rallying call reduce spending' has joined malaysia boleh' on centre stage
every week seems to bring fresh news of cost-cutting measures throwing the foreign minister's recent statement on how malaysia's foreign missions would not be downsized outside the norm
datuk seri abdullah ahmad badawi instead said that steps had been taken to reduce the number of staff members and to freeze recruitment while all mission heads had been advised to watch their spending
the initial reaction may understandably be scepticism on whether these measures are sufficient
malaysia has about 80 embassies and consulates around the world to date a complex operation that is fuelled by increasingly expensive foreign currency
some buildings to house the missions have been bought in the past but others continue to be rented salaries for local staff allowances for malaysian staff rental payments fee for utilities and more have to be paid
all that against the backdrop of a weakened ringgit is likely to add up to a headache-inducing bill especially in view of the government's decision to cut spending by 18 per cent
south korea one of the worst hit by the regional economic problems has reportedly closed down some of its foreign missions to cut costs
should malaysia follow its lead or at least downsize
perhaps not
money can probably be saved in downsizing the missions but it would be offset by the potential loss or damage to other assets that are less tangible than hard cash but no less important trade contacts diplomatic ties and political inroads just to name a few
as malaysia's point soldiers' on the international arena foreign missions yield invaluable relationships and agreements that benefit the country in the long term
to disturb the present network now at least without careful study would only boil down to short-sightedness
as a retired member of the diplomatic corps also pointed out foreign missions are only opened if they are likely to bring some benefit to the country
when a mission is opened it's in view of its usefulness to malaysia
he said calling it a very well thought out process
the missions are also periodically adjusted according to how well they are doing they are closed if they don't yield enough results for example so they are not static
closing down a mission just to cut costs would also be inadvisable he said as other countries had tried to do the same thing in the past only to regret their decision later
they would shut it down then a few years later when their economy improved they found that it was more expensive to re-open the mission it has happened before he said
downsizing may also have an impact on the quality of malaysian officers who man these missions that too would be a costly mistake
as diplomatic and cultural representatives of the country these officers must project a national image of which we can all be proud and which would certainly be noted by leaders and members of the host country
intelligence training and resourcefulness are all necessary traits in the diplomatic corps now more than ever in view of the country's present situation
malaysia's diplomats although living far from home where economies may be healthier will certainly be pestered by wisma putra to keep a watchful eye on their spending
although there is no directive to downsize the missions diplomats can play their part by watching their budgets as they organise functions or celebrations at the embassies or consulates seek apartments or houses for rent or even buy furniture
after all they too will all come home some day to face the problems alongside everyone else

the force of the contagion effect of thailand's currency devaluation in july took malaysia and other regional countries by surprise giving them no chance to counter the ensuing onslaught of currency speculation
consequently the ringgit fell by over 40 per cent against the us dollar to hit a record low of 39200 on december 15
the south-east asian currency turmoil started in may with the waves of speculative attacks on the thai baht which intensified during the third quarter of the year
following the devaluation of the thai baht on july 2 market sentiment deteriorated rapidly triggering speculation and selling pressure on other regional currencies resulting in the us dollar posting hefty gains
between july 2 and december 1 the greenback had gained 636 per cent to 4040 baht 50 per cent to 3650 rupiah 391 per cent to rm351 321 per cent to 3483 peso and 116 per cent to s$15960
in the initial stages of the turbulence efforts to stabilise the currencies and curb speculative activities included central bank support and sharp increases in domestic interest rates
these measures soon proved futile and policy focus turned to preserving positive economic fundamentals and ensuring soundness of the banking systems
thailand and indonesia were subsequently forced to seek international assistance to revive investor confidence and stabilise their financial markets
and so was the philippines which obtained assistance in july under the international monetary fund imf extended financing facility and supplementary financing amounting to a total of us$11 billion us$1 rm387 primarily to replenish its foreign exchange reserves level
on august 20 the thai government secured us$172 billion in loans from multilateral and bilateral sources coordinated by the imf
as part of the bailout package the thai authorities under then prime minister chavalit yongchaivudh started implementing a macroeconomic stabilisation programme and various financial reform measures
this included the announcement in mid-october of a major restructuring of the ailing finance sector and tough guidelines to improve regulatory and supervisory standards
however political uncertainties undermined confidence in the authorities' ability to see these measures through
as a result the baht weakened further to 4120 against the us dollar on october 31
chavalit's administration came to an end and the new thai government pledged its commitment to the macroeconomic stabilisation and financial reform measures in compliance with the conditions of the loan package
however players were not appeased as the baht continued to sink and hit a record low of 41214 against the greenback on december 16
similarly selling pressure on the rupiah persisted into october amid concerns over the external debt burden of the private sector
to overcome the country's problems and restore currency stability president suharto's government announced in november that it had obtained an international assistance package amounting to us$40 billion from the imf
the government also took steps to stabilise macroeconomic conditions and implement a structural adjustment programme involving moves to liberalise the economy and trade as well as to reform the domestic banking sector
this announcement was reinforced with coordinated intervention by bank indonesia the bank of japan and the monetary authority of singapore during the first week of november which helped to stabilise the rupiah rate at 3400-3600 against the us dollar
however worse was to come in december on news that president suharto had been taken ill and the downgrading by standard and poor's of three indonesian firms the rupiah hit a record low of 52025 against the us dollar on december 18
in the wake of plunging regional currencies the ringgit was not spared
problems arising from its depreciation prompted the malaysian government to announce in october a belt-tightening budget for 1998 which was followed by further measures aimed at revitalising the economy
also in october the currency turmoil moved north to south korea and hong kong causing for the first time since the crisis surfaced a meltdown in the global stock markets
while hong kong resolutely defended its currency peg to the us dollar south korea sank into a quagmire that required a record us$57 billion imf-sponsored bailout
all in all 1997 proved to be a year of market trauma and economic distress for the region
many economists however remain convinced that the economies would bounce back for some in a matter of months and others maybe a little longer
they should in fact emerge stronger once the house-cleaning - though forced - is completed

bank simpanan nasional bhd bsn is negotiating for a possible takeover of a finance company which will be subsequently merged with its own finance arm bsn finance bhd
the discussions are in a preliminary stage and chiefly revolves around the asking price for the company said bsn chairman datuk ahmad zahid hamidi yesterday
the price quoted is more than rm300 million which we consider too high he said adding that bsn has also to take into account its own liquidity position
zahid declined to name the finance company but said it is one of the top 10 finance companies in the country
speaking to reporters after the launching of bank simpanan's new prizes for its premium savings certificates he said approval from bank negara to start negotiations has yet to be received but verbally bsn has been given the nod to undertake the exercise
recent business times reports quoted sources as saying that bank negara was marshalling the consolidation of local finance companies
the finance companies were reported to have finalised talks to have five or six of them acting as anchor companies under which others would be merged to consolidate and strengthen the industry
bank negara subsequently confirmed the reports
finance companies are said to be feeling the heat to merge not only because of the current economic situation but also in view of the stiff competition for resources including funds to lend which they had faced for some time
there are 39 finance companies operating in malaysia but a large chunk of the market comprising primarily the hire-purchase business is in the hands of the top six
bsn finance formerly known as kewangan kgn bhd is wholly-owned by bsn
its commercial banking arm bsn commercial bank bhd is in the process of merging with oriental bank bhd
zahid however denied that oriental finance bhd is the finance company with which bsn has started discussions
on the merger of bsn commercial and oriental bank zahid said a holding company will be formed with equal shareholdings for the current owners of the two banks
he reiterated that the exercise will not be a takeover by any party
bsn owns 413 per cent of bsn commercial other substantial shareholders are tabung amanah warisan johor 30 per cent national land finance cooperative society ltd 7 per cent and syarikat kerjasama nesda pelbagai sdn bhd 57 per cent
oriental bank is a 739-per cent subsidiary of malaysian industrial development finance bhd
zahid also said the merchant banks owned by midf and bsn are not involved in the exercise only the commercial banks will be merged midf owns 70 per cent of malaysian international merchant bankers bhd and bsn wholly bsn merchant bank bhd
dismissing suggestions that the merchant banks would have to compete for the same business with the merged bank zahid said they have their respective client bases copyright 1997 malaysian business all rights reserved as distributed by worldsources online inc

japanese banks may cut lending to asian region

asset consolidation by japanese banks could see them reducing their lending to the asian region and gradually recovering their funds from 1998
according to the japan bond research institute jbri domestic problems faced by japanese banks which have been major providers of long-term funds to asia will put pressure on their international exposure next year
this trend could affect foreign direct investment which has recently started to slow down due to sluggish domestic demand and foreign exchange volatility as japanese and other foreign investors will find difficulties in seeking financing for their investments from japanese banks it said
in a statement jbri said while it is possible that the speed with which assets are slashed could ease somewhat changes already taking place in the credit policy of japanese banks will probably put added pressure on the region's economy
excluding hong kong through which japanese banks mostly lend to other asian countries the claims of japanese banks in asia represent some 70 per cent of their total overseas exposure at us$1186 billion us$1 rm391 as at the end of 1996
the largest loan recipient in asia is thailand at us$375 billion or 204 per cent of its gross domestic product gdp japanese banks are also major lenders to indonesia malaysia and south korea with claims on the countries representing 97 per cent 87 per cent and 5 per cent of gdp respectively
jbri said capital adequacy controls in japan are expected to be tightened in the new year
together with falling stock prices this will necessitate even greater efforts by japanese banks to consolidate their risk assets
even so it is already observed that some smaller or weaker banks are not able to achieve the capital adequacy requirement of 8 per cent and are forced to withdraw from international operations it added
jbri said it is also expected that japanese banks' international banking operations will be under pressure from rising foreign currency fund raising costs due to the risk premium required from them from the market
jbri added however that lending rates in the asian market are being revised upward which could reduce the pressure on japanese banks if competition eases down
the collapse in the credit-standing of asian countries meanwhile is also likely to put pressure on japanese banks' asian exposure as most banks base their lending ceilings for foreign countries on their own country ratings
in most cases the basic assessment of these ceilings will next be revised in january or february next year and this will be reflected in lending plans for the april 1998 term
the asian economic turmoil over the last six months makes it highly likely that each bank will revise its asian country ratings downward meaning that their asian ceilings could be lower than their existing exposure to the region since banks in general have so far increased their asian exposure to close to the ceilings jbri said
in view of these factors jbri believes the weakened capacity to provide funds to asia from japan will put pressure on the economic growth of asian countries
under pressure from jewish groups and the united states to act quickly germany said monday it would pay 200 million marks 110 dlrs million over the next five years to provide pensions to long-neglected holocaust survivors in eastern europe
the agreement comes after an uproar over revelations last year that german veterans suspected of world war ii atrocities were quietly drawing government pensions while eastern european jews who suffered in nazi ghettos and concentration camps were deemed ineligible
with most survivors believed to be in their 80s negotiators had argued time was running out eligible eastern european jews who suffered in nazi ghettos and concentration camps are estimated to number as many as 18000
it's a shame that it comes so late so many of the people have died in the meantime said ignatz bubis chairman of germany's central council of jews but it's better now than never
germany has paid about 100 billion marks dlrs 55 billion to survivors of the nazi regime but those living in the soviet bloc could not apply for compensation during the cold war
after the collapse of communism germany gave 18 billion marks dlrs 1 billion in one-time payments to east european victims of all ethnic groups that suffered under the nazis the government said monday
jewish groups had argued that eastern european survivors deserved the same kind of direct monthly compensation from germany as their counterparts in western europe they got support from the clinton administration and 82 us senators who signed an open letter last august urging germany to pay the pensions
the german government promised in august to find a solution
as we see it nearly 10 years after the fall of the berlin wall the cold war has finally come to an end for the east european holocaust survivors said elan steinberg executive director of the world jewish congress in new york
chancellor helmut kohl's chief of staff friedrich bohl concluded the compensation agreement with israel singer of the jewish claims conference bohl said monday in bonn germany is to pay 50 million dlrs 275 million a year into the fund from 1999 through 2002 bohl said
the conference is to handle distribution of the money which is specifically for jewish survivors
the amount divided among 18000 recipients would generate monthly pensions of about 230 marks a month dlrs 128 a little less than half of what is paid monthly to holocaust survivors in western europe
but the exact amount of the payments is to be decided at a claims conference meeting in new york in february the group said
the german government hopes the conference will introduce a bundle of measures to compensate jewish victims who were especially persecuted in eastern europe bohl said in a statement im-pfg

johor baru sat - several government offices in johor today saw a steady stream of visitors under the state's open day' programme on saturdays
when introduced last week the programme met with lukewarm response with hardly anybody turning up at government offices to meet heads of departments
today however the immigration registration education and other departments all reported good response with many turning up at the offices to seek assistance from the respective directors
under the programme it is mandatory for all heads of departments to be in their offices between 8am and noon on saturdays to attend to public enquiries
one of the departments which saw the biggest turnout was the state secretary's office where a group of 43 fishermen from kampung perigi acheh turned up this morning
the group was among 112 fishermen affected by pollution at sungai kim kim in pasir gudang caused by indiscriminate clearing of mangrove swamps and siltation due to earthworks at nearby development projects
the group which arrived at the state secretariat at bangunan sultan ibrahim at 9am in five vans was headed by the village headman kemat salim 60 their lawyer tan hee soon and village umno branch chairman saad mahat they met state secretary datuk dr shahir nasir who had discussions with them for over one hour also present at the meeting were pasir gudang state assemblyman datuk ks balakrishnan and johor fisheries development authority director omar othman
when told that the group was waiting to see me i made arrangements to meet them at the dewan tun abdul razak meeting room instead of my office as the group was rather large
i am very happy that they came to see me personally as i do not want them to go through a third party to find solutions to their problems

the united states insists on a caspian sea route for turkmen gas bypassing iran
we remain confident that a trans-caspian outlet if studied objectively will be more attractive both politically and economically than transport through iran said the senior us official following talks with turkish officials

jardine fleming apex unit trusts bhd's unit trust fund the jf apex malaysia growth trust has been ranked as the number one trust fund in malaysia by micropal asia ltd
micropal asia is an independent fund analysis company for the federation of malaysian unit trust fund managers
jardine fleming apex unit trusts bhd's chief executive officer mark bullough said the trust which was launched in august at rm500 per unit has done well because it adopted a defensive investment strategy from the very beginning
he added jardine fleming had anticipated that the market would fall and thus took a conscious decision to keep the trust's assets liquid in order to preserve the capital investment as well as to reap the benefits of rising interest rates
as at november 28 1997 the trust which is a joint venture between jardine fleming and its local partner apex equity holdings bhd had only invested 10 per cent in the market and thus giving it the opportunity to bargain hunt for good value stocks bullough said
he however added the downturn of the stock market has also highlighted the risk of short-term and undiversified investment in the stock market
this however can be reduced through rigorous stock selection and broad diversification

kesm industries bhd's burn-in and test processes are technologically ready to respond to the changing needs of their customers for more sophisticated semiconductor devices
kesm chairman mr samuel lim syn soo in his annual report says that while the semiconductor market started its recovery at the beginning of this year we are seeing an increasing need for more sophisticated and well advanced semiconductor devices to meet application such as automobile notebooks pcs portable phones and other products lim adds this year our customers are initiating more transfers of their labour intensive production volumes to neighbouring countries with cheaper labour this move will then allow more advanced semiconductor devices to be relocated from the us to malaysia given our skilled and experienced workers to produce higher value products quickly and in high quality standard
in the course of preparing for the change the challenge for kesm is to fill up available testing capacity with long terms-orders
this will then ensure that we continue to maintain our leading position as the largest burn-in and test service company in the country lin says
the good performance resulted from management's well-timed investments made in the burn-in and testing businesses as unit volume improved
our testing business's strong performance in the first half was muted in the second half following a major customer's decision to exit from the dram business kesm's management has since secured short-term contracts to replace the available capacity according to lim
for the year under review the group spent rm106 million in capital expenditure compared to rm388 million in the previous year
these capital expenditures were mainly for the purpose of expanding burn-in and testing capacities

students can save up to an estimated rm150000 if they choose to study at the millenium institute of technology instead of going to the uk its vice-president tan sri augustine ong said yesterday
he said millenium offers solid british education at affordable local rates
given the current economic situation and the low ringgit against the pound sterling the logical decision for anybody seeking a british business degree is to get it at millenium
this is also in line with the government's drive to get students to study at local institutions of higher learning ong said
millenium was set up as an associate college of middlesex university and will open its doors for the first batch of 200 students on february 16 next year
ong said millenium is also discussing with the authorities on the feasibility of having the entire programme available here
meanwhile millenium has announced a 20 per cent reduction of tuition fees for the year 1998
it currently costs rm36000 a year tuition fees to study in middlesex while it will cost only rm11000 a year at millenium
meanwhile middlesex's regional director of operations professor george chadwick said the associate status is akin to having middlesex university within the heart of malaysia
this is not a twinning programme and a student who enrolls with millenium is from day one considered a full-time student in middlesex with access to its vast expertise and resources chadwick said
middlesex university is a london-based institution with a tradition of education spanning 125 years
in 1996 it won the queen's anniversary prize for higher and further education for its work-based learning programmes
chadwick added that millenium is also looking into the possibilities of establishing a middlesex postgraduate centre and a postgraduate research centre
he said the university hopes developments within the postgraduate programmes can bear fruit in the next 12 months
however this is subject to approval by the malaysian government
we are also trying to formulate some local programmes for instance islamic banking which is a high-growth area
in addition programmes such as computing will benefit both students at millenium and middlesex since the multimedia super corridor is right here in malaysia he said
millenium's founder tan sri lim kok wing said the college is 100 per cent malaysian-owned
there is no sharing of profits per se
the partnership with middlesex is on a contractual basis however it is a permanent arrangement
the college has a start-up capital of rm2 million excluding campus cost which is about rm40 million lim said
there will be briefings and seminars on the programmes available at millenium on january 9 to 10 and january 15 to 16
business times has learnt that tuition fees in uk cost between rm27000 and r43300 per year for arts programmes between rm30900 and rm55000 for science and between rm84000 and rm90000 for clinical programmes
there are currently about 16000 malaysian students in the uk 14015 us 45531 japan 36000 south korea 33000 taiwan 32000 india and 22000 canada

malaysia's golden crop palm oil is expected to start the new year with a bang where its prices currently hovering at rm1980 a tonne are expected to break the existing resistance level of rm2000 a tonne
market observers said such a scenario where the palm oil prices are quoted above rm2000 a tonne may occur during the early part of the year due to the present weaker ringgit against the us dollar
they noted that the strong bullish sentiments among local dealers that the price of crude palm oil cpo futures on the kuala lumpur commodity exchange klce could trigger the situation earlier
cpo prices have always been firm during this time of the year
the weaker ringgit against the us dollar makes it even firmer one analyst told business times in kuala lumpur
last week the klce saw its cpo contracts for the march quoted at rm2003 a tonne however transaction only succeeded at rm2000 a tonne for the march cpo futures
prior to the currency crisis which started last july the cpo was traded at an average of rm1100 a tonne
now the commodity price has increased by almost 100 per cent
sentiments for cpo prices to continue with its uptrend are strong while the weaker ringgit against the dollar has always been cited as one of the reasons the coming festivals in the next two months should not be overlooked
the fasting month for muslims starts middle of this week and during this month there will be strong demand for the malaysian cpo from countries like egypt and pakistan
in addition to this the coming chinese new lunar year which will also take place end of next month is expected to inject additional boost to cpo demand
china next to pakistan and india is one of the largest consumer nations of malaysian cpo
last may india was the largest importer with 124703 tonnes followed by pakistan with 87183 tonnes and china with 84046 tonnes other buyers include jordan 44288 tonnes the european union 41738 tonnes and japan with 37428 tonnes
meanwhile dealers said that they are confident the cpo price could breach the rm2000 level and hit rm2050 a tonne level by early next year as a result of the weakening ringgit
nonetheless several traders preferred to be on the safe side saying that there could be some correction in mid-january when palm oil registration and licensing authority released its monthly palm oil data on january 15
malaysia's palm oil production this year is forecast to expand by 73 per cent to 9 million tonnes the country consumes some 300000 tonnes of palm oil annually
the increase in matured areas by 106000ha particularly in sabah and sarawak the higher oil extraction rate of 19 per cent in comparison to 1871 per cent last year and the bumper crop at the end of the biological yield cycle which started in 1994 contributed to higher output growth this year

the national unity and social welfare ministry will expand its women literacy programme in felda schemes nationwide in a move to promote and instill reading habits
it has been proven a success and we wish to expand it elsewhere said national unity and social welfare minister datin paduka zaleha ismail to reporters after launching two books by datuk zakiah hanum former national archives director-general in kuala lumpur yesterday
for illiterate mothers they can acquire the right story-telling techniques and relate the stories to their children she said adding that mothers are the best persons to enhance literacy among pre-school children
zaleha said training will be given to the women to enable them to write especially on current issues
earlier in her speech zaleha said literacy rate among women in the country has improved tremendously from 469 per cent in 1970 to 80 per cent in 1993
these figures showed that women in the country understood their rights and the importance of acquiring knowledge through reading she said
zaleha launched two books written by zakiah namely masa berganti masa and tulis dengan tulus
masa berganti masa is a compilation of articles written in the malay magazine massa mostly based on historical facts
tulis dengan tulus meanwhile features reports and information from magazines and old newspapers on the country's history since the 19th century
brazil's and inter milan's star striker ronaldo was expected to be named fifa's player of the year for the second year in a row monday
in an awards ceremony at disneyland paris the 21-year-old would add the coveted trophy to a growing list of awards that he has won over the past year
there were three other candidates ronaldo's brazilian teammate roberto carlos who plays for real madrid dutchman dennis bergkamp of arsenal and frenchman zinedine zidane who plays for juventus turin
national team coaches from more than 120 countries vote for the title
the trophy will be given at a gala banquet in the presence of such great players such as pele franz beckenbauer and sir bobby charlton who were among the initial inductees to the international soccer hall of champions presented by the sport's governing body fifa
beckenbauer whose defending skills help him win a world cup as both a coach and a player gave ringing praise to ronaldo
it's almost impossible to defend against him beckenbauer said he is so fast so skilled and has such a fine technique
there are other fast players but he is very fast and has excellent ball control with it he has the instinct to score goals the german said
ronaldo knows how to score goals especially in france at the all-star match before the world cup draw in marseille ronaldo scored three and easily set up two others
at the confederations cup final in saudi arabia where brazil routed australia he also scored three times
last month he was named the european player of the season after starring at fc barcelona and then transferring to inter milan in a reported dlrs 55 million deal after lazio of rome struggled to also obtain him
he has helped inter to first place and leads the league with 13 goals
ronaldo didn't exactly admit he has his eyes on frenchman's just fontaine's record of 13 goals in a world cup final phrase but ronaldo said with a team like brazil that gives you six or seven chances to score it's possible although the most important thing is to win the world cup
ronaldo said taking the title for 1996 helped him in 1997
winning last year in lisbon motivated me for this year he said i am also young and it's a world cup year this year
his goal-getting skills have drawn frequent comparisons to soccer greats pele diego maradona and johan cruyff
the award ceremony also had the inductees for the international hall of champions which included 10 players two coaches a referee a pioneer real madrid as a club team brazil as a national team a media representative and a person for the good of the game
the players named included beckenbauer pele charlton eusebio johan cruyff alfredo di stefano sir stanley matthews michel platini ferenc puskas and lev yashin

com corp has introduced a new multi-layer switch which the company claimed offers unprecedented levels of network capacity - up to four times that of competing products the corebuilder 9000 system comes with the control and the high-system availability required for the core of enterprise networks
according to 3com the corebuilder 9000 platform defines a new class of high-end switching systems for both asynchronous transfer mode atm and gigabit ethernet high-capacity backbone networks one of the advantages of the new platform said 3com's atm marketing manager for asia-pacific francois tournesac is that it allows the users to use both atm and gigabit ethernet
we want to tell customers that with corebuilder 9000 they are able to use both technologies he said

the corebuilder 9000's flexible architecture supports both cell-based atm and packet-based gigabit ethernet switching in a single platform and can be configured to support a variety of technologies to meet a customer's diverse high-speed switching requirements
as network managers are concerned about protecting their core switching investments in a time of rapid evolution and change flexibility and choice are the necessary requirements for the network core to remain intact while also accommodating new application and network technology demands said tournesac
he said the corebuilder 9000 should be well-received since it offers multi-protocol routing and switching with support for both cell and frame networking technologies
in addition the corebuilder 9000 is designed to provide forwarding rates greater than 100 million packets per second
flexible intelligent routing engine fire layer 3 switching wire-speed routing technology allows the corebuilder 9000 to scale up to 56 million packets per second thus enabling it to support up to 112oc-12 atm ports or up to 126 ge ports
the switch comes with a fully fault-tolerant system that is designed for high availability with complete redundancy and no single point of failure
it also has the oc-12 port density required in the core of new network design and the built-in reliability needed
the bandwidth management features include support for layer 3 switching fast internet protocol ip and mpoa cut-through routing techniques multi-cast/broadcast controls traffic management and congestion control features
the advanced qos/cos features available in the system will enable customers to support mission-critical or delay-sensitive applications such as voice and video
the system also offers distributed management agents that work in concert with 3com's transcend enterprise manager software featuring applications such as configuration and policy-based management status monitoring and reporting
the corebuilder 9000 chasis for atm pricing starts at us$41000 rm184500 and will be available in april this year for the gigabit ethernet version pricing starts at us$35000 and will be available in june
armed men tossed bombs into a mosque and a movie hall in simultaneous attacks outside algiers haranguing the moviegoers for failing to say evening prayers survivors and hospital sources said monday up to 120 people were killed
the attackers threw homemade bombs into the movie hall in sidi ahmed and the mosque in nearby haouche sahraoui then fired guns knifed or hacked at those fleeing survivors said
medical sources at hospitals in algiers and the suburbs said 120 people were killed and 100 more injured in the sunday night attacks
security forces put the toll at 103 killed and 70 wounded authorities habitually give deflated death tolls from massacres and other violence wracking algeria since 1992
the carnage in the so-called triangle of death just south of the capital moved the center of violence back to the region that has borne the largest share of massacres since an islamic insurgency degenerated into blind and brutal killings
the latest killings came on the sixth anniversary of the army coup that forced cancellation of national elections to thwart a likely rise to power of the islamic salvation front the coup triggered the insurgency the violence has left an estimated 75000 people dead
at least 600 people were killed in mountain hamlets of western algeria within a week of the start of the muslim holy month of ramadan on dec 30
there was no immediate claim of responsibility for the latest attacks but suspicion fell on islamic insurgents whose battle to topple the military-backed government moved into its seventh year
the radical armed islamic group known as the gia has long been implanted in the region south of algiers
a gang leader yelled you should be in the mosque for the prayer of the taraouith an evening prayer survivors of the sidi ahmed attack about 20 kms 12 miles south of algiers recounted on condition of anonymity
the attacks began shortly after evening prayers according to the survivors hospitalized in algiers
the gang of about 100 men broke into three groups the largest of which attacked the theater shooting slashing and hacking their victims the witnesses said at the same time a crude bomb was thrown into the mosque at nearby haouche sahraoui those fleeing were gunned down witnesses said
the attacks were the bloodiest in the algiers region since a series of attacks in august and september that left hundreds dead
the statement by security forces carried by the state-run aps news agency said self-defense groups armed by the government and security forces helped push back the attackers at sidi ahmed
the statement said two soldiers were injured and two members of the self-defense forces killed
we know the attackers said farid a young man who lost several members of his family it's the gia they had already threatened us they said we're going to kill you' and they came
farid spoke to the associated press on condition he not be further identified
in an unusual move interior minister mostefa benmansour reportedly visited the site newspapers reported
the relentless increase in massacres has awakened the concern of the international community algeria has agreed to a visit by a delegation from the european union but refused humanitarian aid or an independent inquiry into who is behind the killings
questions have arisen about the possible role of the military in the massacres some of which have occurred within sight of army barracks
an algerian policeman seeking asylum in britain claimed he participated in the massacre and torture of defenseless civilians under orders the observer newspaper reported sunday
the unidentified policeman and a colleague were quoted by the british newspaper as saying that army special forces disguised as islamic fundamentalists with beards and muslim dress slaughtered entire families in the middle of the night
the no 3 leader of the now-banned salvation front abdelkader hachani said in interviews published monday in two french newspapers that the west is in a position to force algeria into negotiations with all political forces - the only viable road to peace hachani was quoted as saying
what is certain is that by refusing a political solution and renouncing the protection of the population authorities bear a great part of responsibility for the massacres the daily le figaro quoted hachani as saying hachani was freed from five years imprisonment in july
the salvation front's military wing the islamic salvation army has been observing a truce since oct 1 in part it says to isolate those committing massacres

kuala lumpur sat - selangor and kuala lumpur motorists topped the list of traffic offenders during the two-week ops statik for the period from dec 21 to jan 3
of the 73462 summonses issued 14820 or 2017 per cent were issued in selangor and 10204 in kuala lumpur
a traffic police official said the high number of summonses issued in selangor and kuala lumpur could be attributed to the large network of trunk roads and expressways in the two areas
the road link in these places is better and the traffic volume higher
this could be one of the reasons why selangor and kuala lumpur had the most offenders he added
perak had the third highest number of offenders with 9191 summonses followed by johor 8897 kedah 5083 penang 4565 sarawak 3925 negri sembilan 3855 and kelantan 3185
the most common offence was speeding which accounted for 21121 summonses or 2875 per cent the other main offences were overtaking along double-lines dangerous driving and failure to abide by traffic regulations
ops statik previously known as ops pacak was first introduced last year to ensure motorists returning home for the double chinese new year and hari raya celebrations abide by traffic regulations
owing to its success in reducing accident rates the federal traffic police will continue the exercise for the coming chinese new year and hari raya balik kampung from jan 22 to feb 8

the government may not hesitate to re-introduce a stocks book system which was used in the 1960s to check hoarding by retailers of essential goods should the unscrupulous activity becomes rampant
domestic trade and consumer affairs minister datuk seri megat junid megat ayob said at the moment the system is only imposed on manufacturers and retailers
under the system manufacturers and retailers are required to keep track of details on the amount of goods they have sold and to whom these records must be transparent and accessible to the authorities
if hoarding activities become rampant we will re-introduce this system he told reporters after opening welsan wholesale cash &amp carry sdn bhd's new outlet and headquarters in kuala lumpur yesterday
asked how bad the hoarding situation is megat junid said so far it has not reached a serious stage and the ministry had only come across such incidents in taiping lumut and setiawan in perak
he noted that authorities of various districts throughout the country have been directed to step up spot checks on retail outlets
megat junid also spoke of an incident where one man accidentally stumbled upon bags of sugar at an optical outlet when he used the shop's toilet
if such a case can happen i am sure that there are other shops hoarding flour sugar and cooking oil and waiting for the day when the price of these items increase he added
megat junid said the government fears that because of some unscrupulous retailers food supply to some districts will be disrupted
megat junid said should the ministry decide to re-introduce the stocks book system it will seek the services of volunteer groups like rela
he also urged consumers and consumer associations to assume some responsibility to check hoarding activities
consumers should inform the authorities immediately if they suspect that there are cases of hoarding megat junid added
on the piracy of intelligent properties megat junid said if producers of original tapes and video dics can reduce their retail prices it will to a certain extent discourage consumers from buying pirated goods

unlike the medical profession the economic sector is full of quacks who pretend to know what is wrong or right with a country or a company the asian economic turmoil has seen many of them appearing on television and giving interviews telling the people of troubled countries that their economies are really sick as thailand is finding out the earlier prognosis on its economic conditions may have been off the mark as the health of the regional economies continues to deteriorate despite the intervention of the international monetary fund thailand is finding itself worse off than before thai prime minister chuan leekpai said his country may be forced to ask the imf to relax the terms of its rescue package as the economic slump further erodes the country's revenues chuan also said thais may be in for even harder times in the form of tax increases to make up for dwindling state revenues
so was the imf wrong about its prescription for the thai economy dresdner kleinwort benson the international investment banker reckoned the imf may have forced the troubled asian economies to deflate too much by setting over-zealous fiscal targets in an environment of slowing growth whether the imf's medicine is entirely appropriate for asia has been questioned by thai finance minister tarrin his concern which we share is over the target for fiscal surplus dresdner kleinwort benson said in a report issued earlier this month it noted that tight fiscal targets are pro-cyclical causing an even deeper downturn and the imf seems to deny there is any validity in the keynesian concept of counter- cyclical stabilisers this refers to the idea that when an economy suffers an expected deflationary shock some moderate expansion of public sector borrowing is legitimate in order to replace some of the fall in private sector aggregate demand
there is no doubt that countries under the imf's care will be cured the question is how much it will cost people and the governments malaysia has made known its dread of the side-effects of the imf medicine to a country's socio-economic structure certainly many countries before the asian turmoil had benefited from the imf but the road back to health is usually long and painful if a mild case of cough is what malaysia has then going to the imf is certainly out of the question what malaysians should do is abstain from that bad habits which could worsen the cough or delay the cure once we are back on our feet we should always remind each other of the need to take real good care of the economy's health

we expect the futures market to trade in the range of 610 to 620 points by the year end while the cash market is expected to trade around the 600- point range he recommends investors to buy on a short rally and to liquidate positions at the 610 to 620-level as selling pressure will emerge at that level amidst a weak overall market outlook for the long term

singapore's blue-chip stock prices fell 22 per cent yesterday amid market concerns over an increase in interest rates after two top local banks raised their prime lending rate
the market concern is interest rates may just keep spiralling next year and this will have an impact on the economy i think the economy can take a 50 basis-point rise now but what if it goes to 100 and then more a dealer with a local stockbroking firm said
dealers said the higher interest rates would be a further blow to the key property sector as loans would be costlier

current economic problems have not affected the performance of bank simpanan nasional bsn its chairman datuk ahmad zahid hamidi said
zahid said bank deposits have also not been affected by present economic woes at a press conference after launching the new prizes and draws for the sijil simpanan premium ssp in kuala lumpur yesterday
he said generally bsn is not affected and savings withdrawals have remained normal he added that the competitive market rate offered by bsn has also resulted in a good savings record
the attractive rate has also enabled the bank to offer various savings schemes he added
on the ssp zahid said since the launch of the scheme in 1978 there are 12 million certificate holders with a total savings of about rm600 million through ssp the bank has garnered net savings of rm107 million more than the target set for this year
he urged anyone who is aged above 12 years to buy ssp certificates as this will increase the country's savings
the nation's savings rate is now about 38 per cent of the gross domestic product and we want to achieve more than 40 per cent as soon as possible he said
earlier zahid launched new prizes for the ssp premium and perdana draws for 1998 with an estimated value of rm9 million the prizes for this year's draws are worth rm886 million
in line with the government's call to use local products bsn has changed the main prizes for the draws next year from luxury mercedes benz cars to bungalows valued at rm400000 each
the bank has chosen 12 bungalows in the bayu lake homes project opposite the staffield golf course and about a 45-minute drive to the city centre
the puteri titiwangsa bungalows which have an area of 3000 sq ft per unit are being built by local developer island and peninsular bhd
in his speech zahid said the bank may increase the frequency of ssp draws and may also add more bungalows as prizes
he expressed gratitude to government departments ministries and private companies which award ssp certificates to their staff as bonuses or in recognition of their service
zahid who is also umno youth chief advised the movement's members to follow party procedures if they intend to contest in the movement's divisional elections next year
he urged candidates to give priority to current economic challenges rather than be involved totally in election campaigns zahid said umno youth's unity is vital as the country's political stability will instil confidence in foreign investors
candidates must contest wisely and according to party procedures we hope personal issues will not be brought up in the campaign the contest should be based on the merits and contributions of candidates he said
zahid said in the coming elections about 40 per cent of the umno youth divisional leaders posts will be made vacant as existing leaders have reached 40 years of age
he said about 10 to 20 per cent of the contestants for posts are new faces in politics
zahid also said the movement wants a clarification from the umno supreme council on the new ruling which prohibits party members with pending court cases from contesting in divisional and branch elections
he said although umno youth supports the ruling the movement wants the ruling to be made clear as court cases involve both non-criminal and civil cases and also traffic offences and family matters

penang sat - rental rates in the majority of shopping complexes have or are being reduced in the face of the current economic problems
a check by the new straits times revealed that many commercial and retail space tenants were being given a breather by their landlords to help them tide over the hard times
rental reductions of between 10 and 30 per cent have been reported as landlords agree to adjustments to help their tenants keep afloat in business by lowering their overheads
many landlords realise that their tenants may otherwise have no choice but to close down said komtar merchants association chairman jimmy chan
it is a case of agreeing to accept less rather to risk getting nothing if their tenants quit especially in times like this when it would not be easy to get new tenants he said
chan said about half of the 200-odd association members who trade in komtar are tenants while the rest are owner occupied
some of our members have reported obtaining rental adjustments of 10 to 25 per cent from their lot owners he said
meanwhile it is learnt that many commercial tenants at the faber penang plaza have sent letters to appeal for rental reductions from the management
faber plaza general manager liew chia yee when contacted in kuala lumpur by phone declined to comment on whether the company would entertain their appeals saying the company would deal with its tenants through proper channels' but as far as the trend is concerned economic forces will prevail he said
meanwhile penas complex management division general manager richard chan whose division manages the midlands park centre kompleks bukit jambul on the island and the megamall in bandar penas in prai said the management had in fact written to lot owners in the complexes to advise and urge them to reduce rentals
many lot owners reponded positively and lowered rentals for their tenants by 10 to 30 per cent but some were not happy to do so he said
chan said however that reviewing rentals alone was not the solution
the various parties - property owners tenants and complex managements - must work together not only to lower costs but also to intensify promotions and increase sales and productivity said chan who is also president of the malaysian association for shopping and high-rise complex managements
for example some traders are opening for business only in the afternoon or closing early whereas the complex is open from 10am to 10pm
this means shoppers who come in early in the morning or later in the evening will come to closed shops he said
chan said he was urging his complex tenants to be open for business during the first and second day of the chinese new year for last-minute hari raya shoppers hari raya is expected to fall on the third day of chinese new year
at the island plaza in tanjung tokong centre manager ks wong said there was no reduction in rentals
he said any adjustment in rentals would however have to be negotiated between the tenants and property owner the belleview group of companies

according to mohd hilmey pnb it has responded to most of the concept request for proposals crfps of the msc flagship applications through various consortia
almost all of the consortia have been shortlisted and we are now waiting for the final decision he told reporters in bukit jalil last wednesday
on pnb it's involvement within the various consortia mohd hilmey said the company would contribute in several areas such as systems integration network services and data recovery services
other forms of contributions would be totally new initiatives on our part like the possibility of smartcard manufacturing

as to whether pnb it's performance will be affected by the current economic turmoil mohd hilmey said the company has enough jobs at hand for the next three years naming the national registration department and the immigration department as some of pnb it's biggest contracts

rhb bank bhd has been assigned a long-term rating of bbb and short-term counterparty rating of a-2 by standard and poor's s &amp p
according to s and p this reflects the bank's strong market franchise good asset quality reasonable profitability satisfactory capitalisation and adequate funding
the bank's rating outlook is stable said s &amp p adding that similar to other domestic banks it is also affected by its loan exposure to share financing a slower property market and the weaker ringgit
sensitivities however include the ultimate shareholder's potentially reduced capacity to inject future capital and rhb's short-term merger operational issues
the ratings agency said that rhb is malaysia's third largest commercial bank with seven to eight per cent of industry assets
with the acquisition of kwong yik bank's operations its proforma assets increased to rm347 billion at july 1 1997
asset quality is also strong with nonperforming-loans-to-total loans of two to three per cent which is better than the 39 per cent system average
although the bank's profile remains inclined towards corporate lending denoting some risk concentration s &amp p noted that the recent merger helped to strengthen rhb bank's retail market presence
the bank's liquidity is adequate as indicated by a proforma loans-to-deposits ratio of 914 per cent at june 1997 slightly higher than the peer average
s &amp p further mentioned that rhb remains reliant on interbank borrowings and time and negotiable certificates of deposit
time and negotiable certificates of deposit made up a high of 751 per cent of total deposits
its main shareholder is rashid hussain bhd which increased its borrowings to net tangible assets gearing to fund the kwong yik bank acquisition
an indirect impact on rhb bank as a result of this is the shareholder's reduced capacity to substantially participate in future capital raisings of the bank unless outside funds are sourced s &amp p said
despite increasing stress on the bank's asset quality and profitability due to adverse developments in the country's economy its financial strength will enable it to endure such strain
it will also likely to benefit in the medium to long term from economies of scale when the integration of its original operations with those of kwong yik bank is fully realised
acting on behalf of the european union britain will press the united states to take a less rigid attitude toward iran following a conciliatory-sounding speech by iran's president british officials said monday
foreign secretary robin cook will raise the issue thursday when he meets us secretary of state madeleine albright during his first trip to washington since britain took over the presidency of the 16-nation eu on jan 1
the us unilateral sanctions will not work nor will old-style european union critical dialogue' work a foreign office official speaking on condition of anonymity told reporters we need to find a new way to approach this important country and very difficult subject
in a cnn interview last week iranian president mohammad khatami called for expanded cultural exchanges with the united states he said he hoped to open a crack in the wall of mistrust
eu officials agree with the united states that iran is seeking to develop nuclear weapons and also remains a terrorist threat
but the eu bans strategic exports to iran as opposed to economic sanctions imposed by the united states and does not think that trading is wrong in principle
officials denied that britain now leading eu pressure to be allowed to trade with iran with impunity had softened its stance about an iranian death threat to british author salman rushdie condemned for allegedly blaspheming islam in a novel
cook will refer to rushdie in a speech to the european institute in washington on thursday officials said
an eu compromise over iran would among other things defuse a potential dispute if the united states imposes sanctions against french russian and malaysian companies that signed a dlrs 2 billion deal to develop natural gas fields in iran
current us legislation calls for such sanctions
last month european union officials complained about us efforts to block trade with iran cuba and libya and said they were working toward a deal to change us legislation
cook also will visit canada on friday for talks with foreign minister lloyd axworthy

kuala lumpur sun - stressing that one of the country's strength is in the unity of its multi-racial community datuk seri anwar ibrahim said it would be unfortunate if malaysians were to fall prey to rumours that the economic problems would lead to racial unrest
the deputy prime minister and finance minister said besides economic strength malaysia enjoyed political stability and the government enjoyed the support of the people
unity is our greatest asset we should capitalise on this to our benefit he said urging the people not to entertain rumours
anwar said this when asked to comment on a foreign report that there was an underlying tension among the races following the economic problems
anwar said he viewed the report with concern as there seemed to be a generalisation that whenever a country encountered economic problems there would be racial tension
malaysia is a very matured country and we have gone through a lot together we recognise a lot of people are now facing difficulties but there is a strong effort by all races and political parties to grapple with the problems and overcome them
the deputy prime minister was speaking after receiving former united states secretary of state dr henry kissinger at the palace of the golden horses the venue for the fourth pacific dialogue
he later met thai deputy foreign minister dr mr sukhumbhand paribatra and us secretary of defence william cohen
anwar was also asked whether the government intended to review further the growth rate for this year following the ringgit's depreciation
he said several measures had been taken to further strengthen the ringgit adding that he did not see the need to revise this year's growth estimates if the currency was to recover slightly from its current position
i can't reveal the level of recovery as it will be exploited by speculators he said adding that he was convinced the currency would somewhat recover in the next few weeks
he was also asked to comment on views of analysts that intervention by bank negara in support of the ringgit had actually delayed the return of the currency to its real value
as you know we have not been very aggressive in our intervention
we have allowed the ringgit to slide but we have also consistently said that the currency must reflect the fundamentals of the economy
bank negara has within its area of competence given the option to intervene to protect the ringgit and not unneccesarily allow it to be devalued or over-valued
he added market forces had been allowed to determine the value but not through excessive speculative activities
to a query on how much bank negara spent to prop up the ringgit anwar said it would be known by the end of the month
but it is within our means and no one should be unduly worried because we have been very prudent cautious and mindful of the fact that the reserves should be substantial
anwar also warned money changers that their licence would be withdrawn if they refuse to accept ringgit in exchange for us dollars saying it was illogical for them to act in such manner
he was commenting on claims that some money changers had refused to sell us dollars to people intending to visit the us
he said the finance ministry had not received any complaint or report on this
but if this has really happened it can be considered as isolated cases he said adding that the authorities were monitoring the developments daily
anwar was also asked whether the decision to reinstate the waiver granted to united engineers malaysia and parties acting in concert with it from having to make a general offer for renong berhad shares they already do not own was the result of investigation carried out by the authorities
yes the sc security commission and klse kuala lumpur stock exchange have submitted a report to the foreign investment committee which then made the recommendation
on whether the interest of the minority shareholders would be protected by the decision he said this had been taken into account
that's why there are lots of conditions imposed together with this approval

in previous articles on parenting i have been talking about forging a strong relationship with your children if you manage to achieve this you would have done much to ensure that your children grow up to be psychologically healthy adults
in addition to this there are also a few other things you can do as parents to ensure that your child will grow up to be sound adults i will be exploring these activities in the next few articles
one of the things you can do to instill healthy emotions in your child is to teach them to be more empathic the payoff is enormous
those with strong empathic capacities tend to be less aggressive and engage in more pro-social acts such as helping and sharing as a result empathic children are better liked by peers and adults and have more success in school and on the job
it is not surprising that empathic children grow up to have a greater capacity for intimacy in their relationship with their spouses friends and children
if you want your children to become more empathic caring and responsible then you must make your family rules clear and consistent and not waiver from them
you must require them to be responsible children as young as three should be expected to clean up after themselves and even help with simple chores like setting the table
they should be expected to help around the house because helping others is the right thing to do and not for rewards or even an allowance getting an allowance and learning how to handle money is an entirely separate matter
if you want your child to be thoughtful considerate and responsible you must raise the bar on your expectations it is easy to be a permissive parent it is easy to make your child's bed or do his homework for him
but to raise more responsible children parents must become more responsible themselves and they can begin by overcoming their denial that spoiling children will not harm them it will
one of the simplest and most effective ways to teach children empathy is to practice random acts of kindness
simple acts of thoughtfulness and consideration can profoundly affect people's lives and good deeds can become life-altering events
indeed from the many stories i hear during my counselling work i can say that kindness emerges as one of the most powerful tools at our disposal as we go through our lives
its power not only is easily accessible to anyone who cares to use it but it also can never be diminished rather it expands with every action
today is as good as any other day to make kindness a family project
purchase a blank journal and record an act of kindness every day for each person in the family
an act of kindness can be as simple as holding the door for someone or making a call to an ill friend as kindness becomes a habit you will find that children can't get enough of it they will go out of their way to perform more altruistic acts
another thing you can do is to involve your child in community service
many schools in the us are beginning to require community service as a condition for high school graduation but the fact that schools must mandate community service in order to graduate as responsible citizens is a sad commentary on how families have failed
while some religious groups practise community service as part of their religious commitment the vast majority of children do not experience the sense of belonging and meaning that comes when people are regularly involved in organised efforts to help those less fortunate
although most parents convey this value to their children it is actual deeds that have an impact
committing yourself and your family to regularly helping others in organised projects will not only teach your children to be more concerned about others it will also teach them social skills the importance of co-operation and the value of perseverance and following through
if you are not a member of a religious or community service group that involves children in at least bi-weekly community service there are several good resources to help get you started
these include the ngos non governmental organisation handbook which is available from the ministry of social welfare the book might contain organisations near you which suggest activities such as joining an organisation to save endangered species
pitching in on neighbour-hood clean-up projects
reading to elderly people at nursing homes
tutoring young children
making dolls for sick children
if you contact your local newspaper you can learn about dozens of worthy projects going on in your community one will certainly appeal to you and your child the key factors to remember in making community service part of your children's lives are choose something meaningful to you and your children
keep your commitment a priority in your life don't let interest fade
participate in the project with your children as much as possible

at a time when confidence in the asian economies is low and as reassurances about strong fundamentals are met with sinister remarks renowned thinkers politicians diplomats and policy makers converge in kuala lumpur today to discuss a host of issues affecting the region
economy is high on the agenda
the two-day pacific dialogue once again groups experts in various fields to discuss and find ways to enhance cultural security and economic co- operation between nations on both sides of the ocean - north or south large or small powerful or weak
the experts include deputy prime minister datuk seri anwar ibrahim united states defence secretary william cohen former us secretary of state henry kissinger former foreign minister of australia gareth evans chairman of the institute of strategic and international studies tan sri dr noordin sopiee asia-pacific policy centre president douglas paal and professor of university of wisconsin's department of political science dr donald emmersen
they will put their minds together to narrow the economic disparity between the various countries and seek to strengthen regional security
the dialogue comes at a difficult time as a number of asian countries are facing economic problems
their currencies have depreciated to record lows mostly undervalued and their share markets have dropped sharply
the dialogue which is being held for the fourth time is crucial now probably more than ever to determine the steps that can be taken by the respective countries to help one another
within a period of seven months the economic gap between countries of the north and south widened further
south korea indonesia and thailand have sought financial assistance from the international monetary fund which in return has imposed tough monetary conditions
malaysia has decided to fend for itself
the experts have many things on their hands seeking ways to create a real pacific-pacific community which calls for economic equilibrium will be their main worry
over the last six months economies of certain asian countries albeit their strong fundamentals took a bashing
their currencies were subjected to manipulative attacks by speculators in the more powerful nations
being important trading partners the bigger nations cannot allow the present economic downturn to continue
pacific countries must definitely look into the problems of trade inequality
the bigger and richer countries must help the smaller ones prosper
otherwise the beggar-thy-neighbour policy mentioned several times by prime minister datuk seri dr mahathir mohamad in recent years would continue to cast a shadow over the world
this attitude must be discarded and be replaced by enrich-thy-neighbour policy rich neighbours will make for greater prosperity all round while poor neighbours tend to sap everyone's energy and resources
a prosperous asian region will provide business and investment opportunities for the developed nations
therefore the enrich-thy-neighbour policy is a practical solution in today's rapidly shrinking world in the face of a global village it must also be noted that hunger and deprivation cannot sustain democracy hunger can lead to unrest and internal conflicts
the richer countries will then lose potentially good trading partners a nation facing unrest will then turn to the developed countries for aid
the cycle goes on and benefits no one
surprisingly the united states well aware of the consequences failed to respond positively to the problems faced by the asian countries once dubbed the tigers of the 21st century
in the case of mexico the us was quick to act and help put the country back on its feet
it is indeed surprising as southeast asian countries mostly affected by the current economic problem are collectively the second biggest trading partner of the us after japan in 1995 alone us exports to asean amounted to us$45 billion rm207 billion
the question that participants of the dialogue will ask is whether asean countries will be able to sustain such trade with us if their economies continue to be undermined
will exporters in the united states find enough buyers of their products in southeast asia
anwar said last friday that there was a general perception that the us was not as enthusiastic with regard to asia as it was in the case of mexico
but i think this is changing and i welcome their recent interest vis-a- vis south korea
analysts believe that the experts will also dwell on possibility of introducing regulations on currency trading as proposed by dr mahathir
of late greed had overcome common sense the depreciation of several regional currencies had also made the world poorer as in a globalised environment such as now the impact was being felt even by those unaffected by the problems
dr mahathir's proposal was supported by a number of countries as currency trading unfettered by rules and regulations accounted for 95 per cent of global trade in goods and services
currency markets continued in secrecy with traders and their trading practices remain largely unknown and yet they had strong influence over the economies of many nations
a set of rules as well as a proper market much like the ones dealing with equities and commodities would make it more transparent and responsible dr mahathir told businessmen ahead of the asia-pacific economic co-operation conference in vancouver in november
at this dialogue scheduled for today and tomorrow the experts will hold three sessions under different themes - the celebration of civilisations security and defence co-operation as well as economic and financial co-operation
under the present circumstances the dialogue should produce concrete results on how the governments of the pacific nations can bolster each other's strength with linked arms otherwise the purpose of the annual meeting of minds will be defeated
as long as they see the other side of the coin and gain valuable perspectives from their discussions the dialogue should be able to achieve its objectives

set in 40 hectares of secondary forest in the northern part of singapore just a half hour's drive from the city centre is the night safari
here the visitor is offered the unique opportunity to enjoy an exciting evening in the jungle in a safe and accessible environment
lighting is absolutely critical to the night safari experience everything the visitor sees is dictated by the lighting the aesthetic quality of which is a principal element of the night safari atmosphere
forest lit by moonlight the big decision taken in 1988 when the singapore zoological gardens was planning the park was to follow the moonlight theme in the habitat lighting it was at first feared that this would be too dark for good animal viewing but in fact the illumination successfully created an atmosphere evocative of a moonlit evening
the elements that make up the moonlight ambience are a bluish cool' colouring and a generally downwards direction the lighting is quite dappled and uneven to heighten the theatrical impression often particularly along trails the light filters through foliage to create complex yet natural shadows
direction of flow visitors can travel around the night safari on foot or by tram
generally the two means of transport do not overlap those habitats designed to be seen exclusively from the road tend to be larger with less detailing than the walking trails
when considering the lighting of road exhibits the visitor was assumed to be looking forwards or sideways into the exhibit and that he would not look backwards
this was a great help when arranging the layout of the lighting appliances which could be placed in such a way as to avoid glare all of this rests on the fact that trams travel around in one direction only
by contrast pedestrians are much more free to look where they please
we assumed a direction of flow along most sections of trail but this was not rigorously adhered to since it is inevitable that walking visitors would see lighting hardware we gave certain views priority over the incidental views one sees while walking
these priority' views tend to be the most important parts of an enclosure for example feeding areas and avoided distractions such as lighting hardware in these areas
art and design illuminating an enclosure can be thought of as an artistic process since it clearly involves painting with light' the designer needs to think in terms of focus and texture feeling and depth
in actual fact the process of creating and maintaining the lighting for the night safari is one of design
although much of the thought and work that goes into making the atmosphere with lighting can be called artistic' the process has been tempered by many practical considerations and inputs
the night safari landscape has light places and dark shadows it was not desirable to apply a uniform illumination over the whole site as the experience for the visitor would be dull and uninteresting
apart from the enhanced pictorial qualities of mottled lighting there is excitement as animals emerge from the shadows
visitor safety as with many aspects of night safari lighting if it looks okay then it is okay if people can easily negotiate their way along the trail feeling secure and sure-footed then the lighting is adequate from a safety point of view
animal visibility many visitors enjoy a mixture of some easy-to-see' animals and others lurking in the shadows but there are also those who prefer the animals to be brightly lit wherever they roam
part of the function of lighting design in the night safari is to exercise judgment in this tricky area of visibility it was impossible to please all of the people all of the time
atmosphere the night safari has been described by visitors as atmospheric magical enchanting mysterious wonderful exciting and romantic the lighting is a key element in the creation of this special atmosphere
inside the buildings a warm' effect is produced to contrast with the cool' habitat lighting this is achieved with dimmed incandescent lamps
quality as well as brightness is controlled by dimmers
the habitat lighting is a mixture of filtered incandescent and mercury discharge the specific lamps in use - par 38 halogen a and hpl-r 125 w - were selected as a partnership after extensive field testing
the control of the habitat lighting depends on the selection and location of lamps and fittings brightness is determined by the type number and proximity of lamps dimmers are not used
par lamps are often used to highlight animal feeding areas and similar points of importance the filtered light of a par halogen a lamp has an extremely high colour rendering index which shows the true colour of the animals
there will always be scope to improve the night safari lighting in a situation where trees animals and designers are always changing and adapting the lighting must remain alive to altering circumstances
inevitably plants grow and of course this is a good thing it can have two impacts on the lighting negative and positive
plants and trees have a boundless capacity to obscure lighting in a material way casting shadows over critical areas and creating hot spots' in their foliage they require trimming but it is important not to overdo it particularly along trails and similar enclosures where the shadow patterns created by leaves and branches can enhance the night safari experience

under pressure from jewish groups and the united states to act quickly germany said monday it would pay 200 million marks 110 dlrs million over five years to provide pensions to long-neglected holocaust survivors in eastern europe
the agreement comes after an uproar over revelations last year that german veterans suspected of world war ii atrocities were quietly drawing government pensions meanwhile eastern european jews who suffered in nazi ghettos and concentration camps were deemed ineligible
with most of the estimated up to 18000 survivors believed to be in their 80s negotiators had argued time was running out
it's a shame that it comes so late so many of the people have died in the meantime said ignatz bubis chairman of germany's central council of jews but it's better now than never
germany has paid about 100 billion marks dlrs 55 billion to survivors of the nazi regime but those living in the soviet bloc could not apply for compensation during the cold war
after the collapse of communism germany gave 18 billion marks dlrs 1 billion in one-time payments to east european victims of all ethnic groups that suffered under the nazis the government said monday
jewish groups had argued that eastern european survivors deserved the same kind of direct monthly compensation from germany as their counterparts in western europe they got support from the clinton administration and 82 us senators who signed an open letter last august urging germany to pay the pensions
the german government promised in august to find a solution for eastern european jews it also cut off the pensions for veterans suspected of war crimes in november
as we see it nearly 10 years after the fall of the berlin wall the cold war has finally come to an end for the east european holocaust survivors said elan steinberg executive director of the world jewish congress in new york
chancellor helmut kohl's chief of staff friedrich bohl concluded the compensation agreement with israel singer of the jewish claims conference bohl said monday in bonn germany is to pay 50 million dlrs 275 million a year into the fund from 1999 through 2002 bohl said
the conference is to handle distribution of the money which is specifically for jewish survivors
the amount divided among 18000 recipients would generate monthly pensions of about 230 marks a month dlrs 128 a little less than half of what is paid monthly to holocaust survivors in western europe
but the exact amount of the payments is to be decided at a claims conference meeting in new york in february the group said
the german government hopes the conference will introduce a bundle of measures to compensate jewish victims who were especially persecuted in eastern europe bohl said in a statement im-pfg
iraq announced monday it would block any arms inspections by a team led american scott ritter a move that could set off a new confrontation with un weapons inspectors
the official iraqi news agency made the announcement quoting an official spokesman who said the presence of too many american inspectors was prolonging the inspections program and delaying removal of curbs on iraq's oil exports
the agency's report came after ritter and a team of un inspectors made a visit monday to iraqi government buildings near the headquarters of the un special commission which is responsible for the weapons inspection program
apparently the team was not blocked since the agency's report said the ban on ritter would begin jan 13 tuesday
iraq has repeatedly criticized ritter accusing him of spying for the the cia
ritter a former marine major who has been an inspector for six years has dismissed the charge as absolutely untrue
ritter was heavily involved in the inspections of sensitive sites that led to last october's standoff between iraq and the weapons inspectors
the government spokesman said ritter's team included too many americans and britons adding the team will not be allowed to carry out inspections unless it is reformed in a balanced manner
the official who was not identified by the agency said the team included nine americans five britons a russian and an australian
this shows striking evidence of the imbalance in the composition of the team and its methods of action in iraq the spokesman said
an iraqi official said government buildings visited by ritter's team monday included a hospital and prison in baghdad
in new york un secretary-general kofi annan said no decision has been taken to halt inspections in the wake of iraq's statement on ritter he noted that the chief weapons inspector richard butler was to travel to baghdad for talks jan 19
butler is due to talk to the iraqi authorities about their barring the un teams from some 60 sites including about 40 presidential palaces on grounds of national sovereignty
i hope that the iraqi authorities will not do anything precipitous and will wait for mr butler to get there to raise whatever issues they have with him annan told reporters
iraq's un ambassador nizar hamdoon said iraq considered such a large percentage of british and americans on the ritter team to be unacceptable
iraq has insisted that the work of the special commission especially on the inspection side should be more balanced in composition hamdoon said therefore iraq is not going to accept this heavily influenced team by the american and british nationals
the other un inspection teams in iraq would be allowed to continue their work hamdoon said
in baghdad the iraqi spokesman also accused american weapons inspectors of carrying out activities detrimental to iraq's national interest
they have been falsifying facts inventing lies deliberately prolonging the process and sending false reports to the security council the agency quoted him as saying
the continuation of this situation is unacceptable he added repeating charges that americans dominate the weapons inspections program at un headquarters
during last fall's confrontation iraq accused american inspectors of spying on iraq and helping plan for us attacks on the country un officials denied the charges and pulled all weapons inspectors out of the country the impasse was ended with russian mediation
the inspectors' job is to certify that iraq has fulfilled its obligation under un resolutions to eliminate its weapons of mass destruction
sanctions imposed on iraq following its 1990 invasion of neighboring kuwait _ which include a ban on the export of oil _ cannot be lifted until the un security council accepts that iraqi weapons programs have been halted
iraq maintains it has fulfilled the requirements under security council resolutions but the weapons inspectors have repeatedly accused the government of president saddam hussein of hiding weapons and the means to manufacture them
ritter has been involved in so-called concealment investigations in which inspectors seek to find materials believed hidden by the iraqis his inspections have been a source of friction especially as they deal with sensitive sites such as saddam's palaces lb-ggl/jbm

the man is serious the little girl impish and the young man somewhere between the two all three are equally charming once their fingers find the ivories
the name james vadiveloo will be familiar to classical music lovers and some may have heard of prem vadiveloo they will soon find out about premila as father son and daughter are all slated to perform with the kuala lumpur chamber music players this week
james who holds down an associate professorship with institut teknologi mara besides holding the fort for the klcmp has been selecting scores getting musicians securing sponsorship booking venues and seeking publicity plus playing in the concerts themselves for 16 years
in other words he's the man behind the outfit
it all started in the early 70s when we played under the auspices of the british council's chamber music concerts however when i came back after pursuing my phd in london in 1977 it had ceased to exist
as a musician you need to perform if you don't your skills will just deteriorate so i set up klcmp in 1982
the group has been treating audiences to acclaimed performances ever since
my intention was to create a platform for accomplished musicians to showcase their talents which they otherwise would not have the opportunity to do
as a pianist i cannot be a permanent member of an orchestra even within an orchestra there are varying levels of abilities and the pieces they play have to take that into account frequently there is not much opportunity to play the more difficult and demanding pieces
actually premila has been featured in our concerts before she was the page-turner james laughs and premila giggles along
prem used to serve as page-turner for me but later when he began to play somebody else had to do the job who better than his sister
but now that premila will play as well we'll be on the lookout for someone else
james says he's not really grooming his children to be performers although prem will be taking his associate of the royal college of music performer's examination in march
james teaches his children himself and his efforts have obviously borne fruit seeing that both prem and premila passed their abrsm grade 8 and 5 respectively with distinctions
as a father i just want them to excel in whatever it is that they do
he says and this they have done with aplomb with a list of accomplishments as long as their arms despite their tender years
premila is a tennis player to be reckoned with emerging as the under-10 singles runner-up in both the national age-group and kl open championships last year
she was also the girls' overall champion in the royal lake club swimming competition and has appeared in kuali works' colour blind and the selangor philharmonic society's the king and i
prem has also many theatre credits to his name too many to list and has recently come back from a youth exchange music programme in switzerland he too plays tennis and swims and will be participating in this year's sukma in the 100m and 200m backstroke
despite his talents on the piano prem claims to have no intentions of being a professional musician and this seems to go down well with their father
life has a lot to offer there are too many opportunities out there to stick to just one area of expertise
many of my friends have illustrious careers in addition to being serious musicians and accomplished athletes that's what makes them such interesting people
besides performing is not a money-making venture al-though most times we do get enough from proceeds to cover costs plus a little extra for the players' transport and so on
it's a good thing we all have our bread-and-butter jobs that's also why we started using children so we don't have to pay them james jokes to the wide-eyed indignation of the siblings
seriously though the children came about because i had wanted to do a concert showcasing players who were under 12 auditions were held sometime last year but sadly we could not get enough players of calibre in the less popular instruments as most malaysian children play only the piano
but those that are good we have retained for the regular concerts with the adults this includes audrey tan who plays the violin and jin kyeong suk on the flute they will appear as a junior trio together with premila in our forthcoming recital
but then in a way this is also good as we can now choose the more challenging pieces for them and take them to the limits of their abilities rather than trying to accommodate everybody and ending up with a mediocre performance
the recital will also feature soprano audrey vallance gary flach on the clarinet joost flach on the oboe and dragan cicovic on the flute
dutchman joost and bosnian dragan are both professional musicians with the malaysian philharmonic orchestra and kl symphony orchestra respectively while american gary flach teaches with the international school of kuala lumpur audrey was a professional singer in the states before coming over here a few months back
the programme will include saint-saens' caprice op 79 for flute oboe clarinet and piano myslivecek's trio in b-flat major op 1 no 4 for flute violin and piano schumann's frauenliebe und leben for voice and piano mendelssohn's variations serieuses op 54 for piano ibert's two interludes for flute violin and piano and milhaud's sonata for flute oboe clarinet and piano
the concert will be held on jan 16 and 17 at the british council hall at 830pm tickets at rm20 are available from the selangor institute of music 7566202 and the klcmp 2834586

action at school level vital in curbing crimes by juveniles'

kuala lumpur sun - only a small percentage of offences committed by students are reported to the authorities and the sharp increase in the number of arrests in recent years is not reflective of the actual situation
stating this recently national union of the teaching profession secretary-general n siva subramaniam warned of serious implications to society unless the problem is tackled effectively at the school level
from 3560 in 1995 the figure for juvenile arrests rose to 4681 in 1996 for serious offences including murder rape armed robbery and house-breaking despite the sharp increase in the number of arrests in the last two years this was merely the tip of the iceberg said siva
he attributed this to the reluctance on the part of headmasters to blemish their records and therefore most cases were settled in schools
the headmaster will have to answer for every case reported but since this will go against their record they would rather close the cases without reporting them
he said hardly 10 per cent of discipline cases for example coming late to school truancy and smoking were reported by schools to the state education authorities furthermore hardly one per cent of serious criminal cases were reported to the police and welfare department
in urging disciplinary action to be taken against school heads who fail to report disciplinary and criminal cases he said the problem was also compounded by society's tendency to view schools as responsible merely for academic achievement compared to a more holistic development of the individual
a school's contribution to society is not only in the number of professionals it churns out but also the criminals it produces
another major hurdle in tackling indiscipline in schools is that society still lacks proper understanding of its implications the public is greatly underestimating the extent and nature of crimes students are involved in he said
rape theft dadah trafficking and other crimes are behaviours which start in school
an important factor in maintaining discipline siva said was that the methods used must suit the student's needs
a survey conducted by police found that the three main causes of juvenile delinquency stemmed from a failure to fulfil the individual's needs
the factors include parental neglect the influence of entertainment outlets which promote sex and alcohol and strains in family relationships
the national dadah agency estimates revealed that the most serious offence committed by juveniles is dadah addiction
the home ministry recently revealed that more than 20000 students may be involved
statistics compiled by the ministry showed that between 1988 and 1996 50 per cent of dadah addicts were between 16 and 24 years old currently 50 per cent of addicts have sijil rendah pelajaran or penilaian menengah rendah qualifications and 26 per cent with sijil pelajaran malaysia
siva said closer co-operation between the agencies concerned was the key to solving the problem
if all parties work together to deal with a commonly acknowledged problem i am confident that we can cut the figures of juvenile cases in half within a year
australia and former england coach terry venables agreed monday to sell his reported 51-percent controling interest in the struggling english first-division team portsmouth
the deal reported to be worth more than 200000 pounds dlrs 320000 comes with the team rooted last in the 24-club first division with losses reaching 150000 pounds monthly
venables has controled portsmouth for 11 months but has failed to attract the investment he originally hoped for when he arrived at fratton park after guiding england to the 1996 european semifinals
team director martin gregory and the gregory family which brought venables in to rejuvenate the team will now control 96 percent of the club gregory on vacation said it was time for venables to leave
the time is right for venables to go gregory said he should walk away i realize i am not the most popular person in portsmouth but things were never this bad
we thought we were pulling one of the world's top coaches but it has not worked he added
venables' position came under threat when the club failed to pay its players for november also of concern was his absence to guide the australian national side in qualifying games for the 1998 world cup in france

corporatisation should not be viewed as merely a salary revision for employees
the process instead should be seen as one which improves the quality efficiency and productivity of an organisation through the full utilisation of its physical human and intellectual resources
in the case of local universities for which corporatisation is imminent the aspect of relieving the government of its financial burden in terms of higher education can be achieved by exploiting available resources
these then according to universiti sains malaysia registrar datuk siti mazenah saat encapsulate some aspects of an issue which is a current topic among local academicians
in outlining the criteria for a university to be corporatised siti mazenah said a university should not only look at increasing its efficiency effectiveness and productivity it should also find ways of generating income and employing quality management practices to ensure it is optimally sized
and where is usm in terms of reaching these goals
usm met these criteria well before talk of corporatisation even began
she said
however we feel we can improve ourselves further we were hoping to be the first university in the country to be corporatised as we thought we fulfilled the basic criteria
having said that we hope now to be the next university to be corporatised after universiti malaya
and who should be a better authority on the subject than the person who for the last 20 years has held the training needs of usm's nearly 6000 employees close to her heart
her human resources planning responsibilities extend from recruitment promotion retirement and remuneration policies to handling grievances disciplinary action and management-union relations
as a firm subscriber to the adage that the working environment must be conducive to work in siti mazenah says that good quality worklife accorded to employees is one way of ensuring increased productivity along with a quest for excellence and concern for personal performance
in playing its part usm provides certain facilities for its staff and these include a charity fund religious programmes along with courses on marriage and performing the haj
these along with various training programmes carried out are targeted at carving a university culture which promotes teamwork and a desire to excel
siti mazenah cites usm's core areas of teaching research and consultancy as the university's strengths
based on what we have now the university is set to go far thanks to the strong foundation it has established
siti mazenah was born in penang in 1943 and received her early education at the st george's girls school
she obtained a bachelor of arts degree from universiti malaya in 1967 after which she joined the public service department as assistant director for its training and career development division
she later assumed the position of chief assistant director at the deparment's planning and career development division
prior to joining usm in 1977 siti mazenah served as chief assistant secretary at the ministry of education's service section for three years where her responsibilities included human resource planning for teachers preparing recommendations for upgrading of salary schemes for teachers along with training headmasters and headmistresses as managers
her plans following her retirement next september are not finalised at present
the avid reader who finds travelling a balm to her otherwise hectic working life adds i would however like to continue in the education field
and how best would she like to be remembered for in her contribution to education
i would like to be seen as one responsible for the development of a strong human resource management programme for usm teamed with keen planning and strategy aspects
the country's first female university registrar does not relish being labelled lady registrar
i am an individual and want to be assessed as an individual and not as a woman
what is important is not the number of women who have made it to the top but the number of women who have been effective
siti mazenah's drive and determination in all aspects of life she embraces seems best embodied in the poem she wrote called expectation found perched on a pastel frame in her office i am being driven forward into an unknown land the pass grows steeper a wind from my unknown goal stir the strings of expectation still the question shall i ever get there there where life resounds a clear pure note in the silence

political cynicism is not a new phenomenon glimpses of it are often gleaned from the new sunday times series my wakil rakyat and i
apart from the prime minister and some national leaders i generally don't trust politicians some of them are there to look out for themselves said k raj a financial analyst with a local brokerage house
is this just one person's perception of politicians
datuk abdul latiff mirasa state assemblyman for seberang jaya and a former psychology lecturer with universiti sains malaysia believes it is
he says it is typical of the asian mentality to think negative whatever the realities about elected leaders they are irrelevant in determining public acceptance or rejection not what is but what appears to be determines the image of public figures
deputy minister in the prime minister's department and member of parliament for tasek gelugor datuk dr ibrahim saad muses on the dilemma of being a politician whatever politicians do or say are always open to public scrutiny what they say may not necessarily be true or without reason when you say you cannot do something people lose faith in you
the public also sees that anybody can become a politician you are plucked from somewhere and become somebody and so the public sentiment is if this guy can do so can they even with my phd some are sceptical of me
latiff defensively points out one or two critical voices do not wipe out the unheard voices of support and affirmation of positive things in politics
but as a former mp with 20 years experience points out cynicism creeps in when the electorate sees elected representatives as people who have the power but who rarely deliver
common complaints some representatives do not mix regularly among the people and issues are often treated as capital for publicity
ibrahim feels strongly about delivery of electoral promises be it small or national issues you must deliver what you promise otherwise you will lose your credibility
datuk lee lam thye a former mp with 23 years experience says if you cannot do something tell them the people will appreciate your honesty
the notion that there is something false about politicians also leads to political cynicism
says the former mp some portray themselves as moralists speaking out passionately on corruption and social isues but they are politicians of poor repute
inadvertently people who come to know about it will lose respect and trust for them you can't fool people all the time
distrust will seep in when the image of politicians is tarnished by ethical questions as varied as wife-abusing to allegedly giving business favours
says one umno member it's as bad as discovering you've been cuckolded by your wife the code of uprightness does not grip all politicians
any number of people harbour the perception that public office is often used for private gain known cases of politicians who yielded to bribes give the impression that the political system is driven by moneyed interests questions often arise whether a politican could have come as far and as fast without a somewhat blunted moral sensitivity
penang deputy chief minister and state assemblyman for permatang berangandatuk shariff omar is quick to extricate himself from this commonplace notion
i'm proud of the fact that i and my family members are not involved in any kind of business when you hold public office you shouldn't have business interests but backbenchers can have business interests
that's not to say that it's a political detriment to be rich as t
maran a 31-year-old factory worker who claims his wakil rakyat could not do anything about the sewage water that filled up his house and 20 other houses in kampung master tasek gelugor says i don't mind if politicians get rich but don't forget our basic needs and their responsibilities all i need is proper drainage my 18-month-old child keeps getting diarrhoea because of the poor hygiene
ramlah bee 62 who suffers the same plight says we are not envious of their wealth but they should not neglect their promises to us
parti rakyat malaysia president dr syed husin ali says that some see politics as an avenue for self-advancement but once they gain office they should do proper constituency work
factionalism brings about disillusionment among the people says a resident of pengkalan batu tasek gelugor in this area the political arena is dominated by two giant figures - shariff and ibrahim
we have asked for tarred road but his aide said we supported zakaria bakar the previous state assemblyman but aren't we all members of the same party
when asked about this shariff insists i have always delivered i don't discriminate i treat everyone in my constituency equally be it umno members or opposition members
he claims people don't understand party protocol
if ibrahim wants to do anything here it has got to go through the division and i'm the division head in my bahagian i am number one
that's the mechanism and ibrahim understands that
ibrahim muses philosophically political posts are scarce resources
it's like a constant pie - a zero-sum game if you get the post it means i don't get it because of the vying for the posts everybody else is subjected to slander beyond your wildest imagination particularly nearing party elections
an umno member puts it succinctly that's politics
but what does it tell the man on the street it tells them that political life is a domain in which ambitious politicians struggle for dominance but it is not a structure which citizens can come to grips with
says ibrahim politicians must be able to rise above the problem when it comes to party politics sooner or later you have to choose whom you want to support it's a process you have to go through but that's as far as you should go otherwise the party cannot survive
it's the conduct or performance of politicians that make politics a dirty game remarks the former mp
lee agrees the impression is that politics is dirty but in actual fact politics is sacrosant its objectives are noble politics helps in building a better nation and bringing about a caring society
syed husin points out that people are governed by their own consent
they have themselves to blame if elected leaders don't perform satisfactorily
he fears cynicism could lead to diminishing participation in the political process this will allow for the possibility of power being concentrated in the hands of a few people
but instead of demanding a higher moral quality in their politicians and political institutions many people choose to stay away from politics
they are locked in their own private milieu and applying the greek definition of the idiot as an altogether private man then it must be concluded that many among us are idiots
as ibrahim asks if people keep away from the political process who will change things
in the wake of a rare snowstorm that blanketed jerusalem families brought their children to the city to see snow for the first time monday
it looks like cotton exclaimed one little boy as the train from coastal tel aviv which received only hail and heavy rains during sunday's storm approached the snow-covered hills
more than a foot 50 cm of snow fell overnight in the holy city and other hill areas of israel and the west bank
a carnival-like atmosphere prevailed in jerusalem delighted children used plastic bags as boots and adults cleared doorsteps with rubber squeegees
heavy snow closed mountain roads and caused power outages in lebanon and syria in jordan more than six feet 2 meters fell in some areas stranding drivers and closing airport runways blizzards in western iran stranded hundreds of motorists
in jerusalem the first heavy snowfall in six years closed most schools and businesses the army canceled its field exercises and israel radio offered tips to drivers unaccustomed to coping with snowy roads
because the city doesn't have a snowplow fleet workers used bulldozers and earth movers to clear the roads
an announcer on israel's channel 1 tv gleefully held up a handful of snow to show viewers what the stuff looked like
in the streets people picked their way around snowdrifts cameras in hand impromptu snowball fights broke out on street corners a group of tourists built a snowman in the shadow of jerusalem's western wall judaism's holiest site
in the bible in the psalms when david says white as snow' i always wondered how he knew what snow was like said john vest visiting from florida now i know
at the israeli checkpoint outside the west bank town of ramallah two straight-faced israeli soldiers stopped arab drivers _ then broke into grins and lobbed some snowballs
in west bank towns and villages young palestinian men helped stranded motorists shoveled entrances to hospitals and delivered bread
our country is not made for this kind of weather huffed nabil mazbar as he shoveled the sidewalk in front of his al bireh home if it rains two drops the electricity goes out
the snow cut power water and telephone service in some areas of israel and the west bank
voice of palestine radio broadcast telephone numbers for civil defense officials and hospitals while playing a well-known arabic tune called it's snowing
the little flowers are cold and the sheep are having a hard time singer fairouz warbled
by late afternoon however most of the snow had melted away
elsewhere rain caused problems the palestinian-run gaza strip in the south was hit by flooding in the sprawling khan younis refugee camp more than two dozen families were flooded out of their homes and staying in tents and shelters pvs/hla-dp

kuala lumpur sun - some 60000 foreign workers from the construction and manufacturing sectors which are affected by the country's economic problems will be redeployed in plantations within two months
an official at the primary industries ministry said the decision was made by the cabinet committee on foreign workers which met last week
this followed the rm2 billion loss in revenue incurred by oil palm plantations because of labour shortage last year
but only those with valid work permits will be allowed to be redeployed
there has been much uncertainty in the past few days over the status of foreign workers in both the affected sectors
on friday the home ministry had said foreign workers engaged in the services sector would be repatriated once their work permits expired
foreigners employed in restaurants foodstalls canteens night markets supermarkets mini-markets hair-dressing salons launderettes motor workshops entertainment outlets and sundry and textile shops would be affected by this ruling
it is understood that the immigration department would formulate a mechanism to redeploy these workers to the plantation sector especially oil palm estates
the official said the redeployment of foreign workers from the construction to the plantation sector would be allowed as most of them were indonesians
among the foreigners the indonesians are better equipped with skills and more willing to work in plantations but only suitable ones will be selected others just like those working in the services sector will be sent home the official said
a minimal processing fee and a levy will be imposed if they wish to be redeployed
according to official figures there are about 12 million foreigners working legally in the country
the construction sector is the biggest employer of foreign workers 60 per cent
it is learnt that the cabinet committee will also allow the plantation owners to bring in foreign workers if those here are found unsuitable for the jobs
said the official if those working in the construction sector are found to be unsuitable the sector will be allowed to bring in workers from neighbouring countries
that will only be allowed after all other avenues are exhausted
when asked to comment on the matter primary industries minister datuk seri dr lim keng yaik said there is wisdom in whatever has been decided by the cabinet committee we agree that there are far too many foreign workers in the country but we need to address the labour shortage in the plantation sector immediately
therefore it is our hope that the selective redeployment of these workers to the plantation sector will be expedited
dr lim said that if the government felt that these workers were unsuitable for employment in the plantation sector then it should allow the plantation owners to bring in others
on friday dr lim had said the shortage of workers in the oil palm sector alone had cost the government rm2 billion in revenue
he said as oil palm fruits were perishable products the ministry was unable to increase exports although palm oil prices were very attractive
in grik deputy home minister datuk tajol rosli mohd ghazali was quoted by bernama as saying that if there were a shortage of local workers in the plantation sector especially in oil palm estates foreigners now engaged in the construction and manufacturing sectors would be given priority
president boris yeltsin will meet pope john paul ii in italy next month in what appears part of a broader effort to improve relations between the vatican and the russian orthodox church
also monday the roman catholic church and russian orthodox church announced they would resume talks that broke off during the summer and try again to arrange the first-ever meeting of the pope and the russian patriarch
yeltsin is on vacation in northwest russia after falling ill in december with a bad cold he has been on a sharply reduced schedule for the past month and canceled two international summits that were set for january prompting renewed concerns about his health
but the russian leader will meet with the pope as part of a series of high-profile meetings after he returns to work jan 19
during yeltsin's visit to italy on feb 9-11 he will also hold talks with italian president oscar luigi scalfaro and prime minister romano prodi and travel to bologna said presidential spokesman sergei yastrzhembsky
yeltsin also plans a three-way meeting with french president jacques chirac and german chancellor helmut kohl tentatively set for late march or early april in yeltsin's native yekaterinburg
the russian president first met the pope on a trip to rome in 1991
this time a likely topic of conversation will be a new russian law on religion which enshrined orthodoxy as the leading faith while curbing the rights of other churches
the measure which yeltsin signed into law in september drew protests from abroad including the vatican the pope personally pleaded with yeltsin to block the legislation
meanwhile the russian orthodox church and the vatican announced they would resume talks in moscow on tuesday and wednesday to try to resolve their differences and prepare for a meeting of their leaders it would be the first such encounter since a schism in 1054 divided christians into the orthodox and catholic churches
the pope and patriarch alexy ii had planned to meet in austria last summer but alexy canceled because of unresolved disputes with the vatican over church property and catholic missionary work in russia
the russian church _ which claims to be the largest of the 15 main orthodox branches _ objects to efforts by western churches including the roman catholic church to seek converts in russia
the russian church strongly backed the new law on religion which has made proselytizing by foreign churches more difficult
the vatican delegation will be led by cardinal edward cassidy head of the pontifical council for the promotion of christian unity while the russian orthodox church will be represented by kirill metropolitan of smolensk and kaliningrad

we malaysians are used to flipping through magazines and seeing generous blotches of black ink on its pictured pages courtesy of moral guardians who carefully blot out any indiscreet flashes of the human body
but the defenders of our innocence are extra busy these days kicking back to read a foreign magazine recently i found every single feature article missing its last few pages snipped out so neatly that i hadn't even noticed it at the newsstand
one of the articles was on frank sinatra the part of the story that survived had already covered his affairs with mia farrow ava gardner and his reputed ties to the mob so old blue eyes must have done something really nasty at the end to merit the chop
movie or television censorship has been harped about a lot already but print censorship is a different deal altogether
onscreen the deleted moment passes and the sheer momentum of the plot propels you forward a little confused maybe but forward
but in print the butchered ending leaves you nowhere to go it's like being fed a meal only to have the plate yanked away from you and then getting thrown out of the restaurant still hungry
i took a chance with the next issue of the same magazine and bought it after a quick scanning of the pages suggested that this one had escaped amputation
but i was wrong for a story based on the results of a sex survey had been snipped out yet pictures of kate moss and naomi campbell lounging nude with their agent in a tub full of suds had remained intact
what is the criteria here you mean we can see a character pick at his own wrecked brains in alien resurrection but not see james dean and natalie woods exchange a chaste kiss in rebel without a cause
you mean reading the results of that missing sex survey story would have turned us all into raving perverts but seeing a corpse and a close-up of its regurgitated last meal on the 8pm news won't offend any sensibilities
the censors' scissors and black ink don't always hit the mark you can still catch a flash of a model's nipple here and there if you really looked which kind of invalidates the whole effort in the first place
what all this snipping and inking out might eventually do is make censoring an attractive career prospect after all it'll let you see all the naughty bits without having to wait for the video
what it already does is make you feel like a kid again back in the days when your parents would shield your eyes from the screen if the hero and his love interest got into a hot clinch
when you are well into adulthood however that kind of coy hiding can give you a complex
the last time i went overseas i was taken by surprise when i stumbled into an adult magazine rack and couldn't help but stop gape and then scamper past before the wrath of heaven came down on me
at least now you know the next time you see some asian person gawking in front of the porno rack he or she very likely hails from malaysia

like malaysia japan south korea and taiwan started out as importers of foreign technology these countries have now successfully assimilated the imported technology and have now gone on to develop their own
malaysia however which started late in r&ampd remains very much a consumer of foreign technology we have had some success in developing new technology for the rubber and palm oil industries
in fact we lead the world in some areas of research in rubber and palm oil but even here we are still followers where hi-tech is concerned
looking back academy of sciences malaysia president tan sri datuk dr omar abdul rahman said perhaps the country should have put more effort into research on rubber and palm oil
as far as rubber and palm oil are concerned we have done a lot of research work we have done a certain amount of conversion of rubber and palm oil as raw material to industrial material we have done well but we could have better
if we had concentrated more effort on producing industrial materials we could bring in raw materials and add value here
now we find the cost of production of raw materials labour and land is not as cheap as that of neighbouring countries we have lost out in the production of raw materials but we are still ahead in the conversion to industrial materials
through technology you can find more uses for your modified industrial materials in theory this can go on forever we should find partners with the right technology to continue to do this smart partnership with people who understand our strengths and respect our aspirations
our mistake he said was in not realising early enough that we needed to develop technologies that are important in manufacturing we didn't learn from our experience in rubber and palm oil to develop some degree of domestic expertise in manufacturing
it was crucial omar said to identify critical areas in which the country had a comparative advantage and concentrate our efforts in those areas
there is a programme we are in the process of starting the national technology mapping project this is an exercise that will assess our technological capability in the various technology chains in the manufacturing process
what we are trying to do is carry out a technology audit in sectors of the economy that is important to us it's a combined effort of the government and the private sector
we need to continue building on our strengths we have to do this because we cannot be good at everything
omar said the government had been attempting to raise the r&ampd budget to 15 per cent of the gdp since the fifth malaysia plan but to date it was still hovering around 08 per cent he said efforts must be made by both the government and the private sector to increase the country's r&ampd budget as current funding was far from adequate
south korea he said spends some 25 per cent of her gdp on r&ampd and 80 per cent of it was provided by the private sector
here in malaysia he said r&ampd remains very much a government-led effort with few exceptions the malaysian private sector has shown very little inclination to spend money on r&ampd
research is done almost entirely by universities and research institutes funded by the government through the science technology and environment ministry
currently omar said the private sector contributes a very modest 10 per cent of the total r&ampd budget he feels that malaysian industry should at the very least raise their contribution to a more presentable 25 per cent
we need the private sector to do more to increase our technological capacity the ideal would be to have in-house r&ampd but if that is not possible use government r&ampd institutes or companies
technology management must be made an important agenda in our businesses to compete on the world market your products must be price competitive and have features which other products don't have you have to think of new features if you can't do it yourself you must get other people to do it for you
omar said most international manufacturing companies spend at least 10 per cent of their gross sales on product development
they think of that as a fixed cost and in times of trouble that fixed cost is increased not decreased he added
commenting on the country's problems he said technology was a very important part of the solution
to correct the present economic situation you need more than just economic measures you would need technology measures we have to have goods and services to sell and that depends on technology
more than ever we need to master imported technology and develop our own technology even today local big players do not necessarily understand the importance of mastering technology
why invest in r&ampd when you can buy whatever you want except what you can buy is not necessarily the latest and what is critical is not always available
malaysian institute for nuclear technology research radiation processing technology division director dr khairul zaman m dahlan also feels that the private sector had to change its attitude towards r&ampd
it's the private sector mentality they want everything free of charge from the government we have been organising seminars to expose local industry to new technology but it's very difficult to get them to participate
they either don't want to pay for participation or they ask for fees to be reduced we want to help our industries but they must also do their part
palm oil research institute of malaysia director-general datuk dr yusof b basiron also complained that the private sector was generally reluctant to make use of r&ampd results that were made known to them
our gdp will only grow if research results are exploited the problem is implementation at the commercial level people want to wait and see for others to use it first
he said the palm oil industry had been informed 10 years ago that treated pome - palm oil effluent produced by mills - could be safely applied on land as fertiliser but to date only major plantations have taken advantage of it
pome can be used to increase yield by 15 to 20 per cent in fact the fertiliser value of pome is equivalent to rm136 million per year
now pome is treated for two to three months in a ponding system where the organic matter is destroyed before it is discharged into the rivers
they are throwing away good money
in an effort to overcome such problems and to encourage researchers to commercialise the results of their r&ampd work the government is now requiring universities and research institutes to team up with the private sector
as a result universiti putra malaysia agriculture faculty dean professor dr mohd yusof hussein said most of the research work carried out at upm were now commercially viable
in the past fundamental research made up 70 per cent of research done at upm now fundamental research is down to 40 per cent because of pressure to get funding from the science ministry's intensification of research on priority areas scheme
of the total of rm95 million received by upm for r&ampd in agriculture during the sixth malaysia plan 1991-1995 rm71 million was provided by irpa
last year mohd yusof said upm set up a university business centre to market its r&ampd capability the agriculture faculty is collaborating with the private sector to develop a hydroponics system that is viable in local conditions conduct research in ornamentals cut flowers and turf grasses and use micro-organisms to increase the ability of plants to absorb nutrients for faster growth
the corporatisation of research institutes has also resulted in a stronger emphasis on commercially viable r&ampd
since its corporatisation sirim president and ceo dr mohd ariffin aton said the organisation had become much much more focused on doing r&ampd that has industrial applications
since corporatisation we have had to get research funding by selling our r&ampd services to the private sector or by bidding for government research funding
as a result our r&ampd is more focused and more market-driven our researchers are getting more and more conscious about cost before the focus was on knowledge now with the aim to commercialise r&ampd our researchers have become very conscious of the cost of conducting research
the downside is we don't have money for very fundamental work out of 35 projects six or seven involve fundamental research for us that is a good mix because our role is very industry-related
mohd ariffin who worked as a researcher with universiti kebangsaan malaysia for 17 years also warned that fundamental research work in the universities would be adversely affected by corporatisation unless provision was made for r&ampd work to be done solely for the sake of knowledge
under the first two malaysian plans the universities were allowed to do a lot of fundamental research now they have to do research with immediate application
two or three years down the road they are expected to have commercial applications that's what worrying about the corporatisation of universities
whether we like it or not we need to do fundamental research
fundamental research is where we get the major breakthroughs we need a strong support based in research
mohd yusof believes that universities should concentrate more on doing fundamental research while research institutes focus on applied research
fundamental research should be given to universities because universitiesare more equipped to do fundamental research we have the infrastructure scientists and professors we also get international and regional funding to do fundamental research
universities cannot run away from fundamental research the knowledge gained is used for lectures and phd and master's theses
he also suggested that universities and research should have a two-way arrangement to allow them focus on their respective areas of specialisation
if research institutes need any fundamental research they can pass it over to the universities or we can collaborate on a joint venture the results of our fundamental research can also be picked up by the research institutes and developed further for commercial purposes
nineteen european nations on monday signed an agreement to prohibit the genetic replication of human beings _ but without britain which considers the measure too strict and germany which considers it too weak
the signing came the same day that french president jacques chirac called for an international ban on human cloning and two days after us president bill clinton blasted a chicago physicist's plans to clone humans as unsafe and morally unacceptable
in a room filled with professors philosophers and doctors as well as diplomats 19 member nations of the council of europe signed a protocol committing their countries to banning any intervention seeking to create human beings genetically identical to another human being whether living or dead
the july 1996 presentation of dolly the sheep the world's first cloned mammal set off an international outcry over the implications for human biology
many us and international leaders renewed their condemnation after chicago scientist richard seed said jan 7 that he planned to begin working on human cloning using a newly developed technique
this is a horror story that the states present here will use every effort to prevent said jean boucauris an official with the greek foreign ministry
earlier chirac told a meeting of members of european national ethics committees that it is on the international level that one must ban cloning and the genetic manipulation susceptible to altering the character of the human species
we would resolve nothing in banning certain practices in one country if the doctors and researchers can develop them elsewhere chirac said it is thus how one should stop the worrying trend that some people have publicly foreseen in the united states chirac said

photography for stage performances is usually allowed but it often depends on the organiser always check on this to avoid unpleasant situations
flash photography can be a distraction for the performer this is more so when you have a dozen or so photographers using their flash units as you sing act or dance
dancers especially can be very sensitive to the distraction of flash photography as they are concentrating on their move-ments and the music
available light photography is encouraged at all times one can say that it is neater' in terms of composing one's pictures you can use fast film like the 1000 or 1600 iso but some find that the 400 iso film is sufficient if the lighting is good on stage
when working on stage performances it is important to understand the kind of lighting available check on how the it changes it can begin with very dim lighting making it difficult for photography even if one is using a tripod before changing to very strong light flooding the whole stage
picture a is an example where the lighting is full on the stage and the performers all stand out clear with their movements captured perfectly
when the lighting is strong it gives you more play in shutter speed and also depth of field
increased shutter speed helps to freeze' a dance motion by not making it too rigid but more flexible if the lighting is poor then the dancers will turn out blurred
picture b is an example of when only one or two dancers come out fairly sharply while the others are a bit blurred the two dancers at the extreme right are facing the light while the those further back do not get enough light and may also be in the shadows of the front dancers
it is easier to focus one's attention on one or two faces in such light situations as shown in picture c it is a mak yong performance where there is only one source of strong light
in this case the light is coming from the left as you can see the actor's face on the left is highlighted while the other half is in shadow
the actress who is facing the light has her face well lit up if the picture was taken from a distance focusing on the whole area it will be difficult to capture their facial expressions because of the poor lighting you will have to work on close-up pictures
when there is only one source of light make sure that you get the exposure of the subject correct since most of the surrounding area is dark the main subject might just end up being over-exposed
the camera can be used to compensate for the poor light area going on manual control you can correct the exposure so as to get the best of the subject that is in the light
this will bring them more into focus remember the topic i discussed last week about shooting from a shadow area into a strong light area
spotlights are common for stage shows they move about with the main performer keeping him very much in focus picture d is an example of this
ramli ibrahim is performing one of his solo dances in a small area here you must be fast to capture his dance movements and expression
he is not going to wait for you the spotlight is on him and therefore the background turns dark bringing him more in focus your exposure will be off him and this will bring out details of his dance and costume and darken the background
these decisions have to be made quickly the only way to get a feel of it is to practise your picture-making regularly you must understand the light you are going to face the strong and weak areas
when single lights like a spotlight is used be careful of strong shadows this always causes a problem as the dancer moves about and it is more pronounced with group performances
five renowned human rights activists won a prestigious dutch award monday for their crusades on behalf of the oppressed and the poor
the beggars' medal went jointly to muchtar pakpahan the jailed indonesian trade union leader sergei kovalyov a leading russian human rights activist activist vera chirwa of malawi aboriginal leader noel pearson of australia and guatemalan lawmaker rosalina tuyuc velasquez
the beggars' resistance foundation presents the annual medal to those who help promote democracy and fight against dictatorship five winners were chosen this year to mark the 50th anniversary of the universal declaration of human rights
past winners include chinese human rights activist harry wu czech president vaclav havel and the amsterdam-based anne frank foundation
the winners will receive their medals during a ceremony in march
after weeks of escalating tensions between russia and chechnya moscow sounded a conciliatory note monday and stressed the need for economic cooperation with the breakaway southern republic
the russian government has been sending mixed signals about its policy toward chechnya in recent days one hardliner called last week for pre-emptive strikes against chechen bandits while moderates are emphasizing the need for compromise
boris agapov the deputy secretary of russia's security council said monday that moscow should work to improve the economy in the region or risk a worsening of the situation the itar-tass news agency reported
president boris yeltsin wants to visit chechnya where he is widely reviled for launching the 1994-96 war that ultimately failed to crush the chechen separatists
yeltsin's spokesman sergei yastrzhembsky said chechnya remained too volatile for the president to travel there but he added that doesn't relieve federal officials from the task of seeking the most flexible and effective ways to normalize the situation
monday's comments contrasted with the hostile rhetoric between the two sides in recent weeks despite a peace treaty last may the russian-chechen relationship is still filled with friction
a russian delegation led by deputy prime minister ramazan abdulatipov traveled to chechnya over the weekend in a bid to ease tensions abdulatipov said the two sides agreed on joint measures for financing restoration of the war-shattered economy
in chechnya meanwhile acting prime minister shamil basayev has completed his selection of a new government which will officially be announced on tuesday the interfax news agency reported
chechnya's president aslan maskhadov asked basayev to form a government in hopes of bringing greater order and stability to chechnya which is still plagued by armed gangs and frequent kidnappings
basayev was a leading field commander in the war with russia and many chechens regard him as a hero russia considers him a terrorist for leading a 1995 hostage-taking raid in southern russia that left more than 100 people dead many of them civilians
however agapov the russian security council official said moscow could learn to live with basayev
we hope very much that the new chechen government and basayev is on it will be able to cope with the problems facing them agapov was quoted as saying by itar-tass he said basayev had made clear his intention to stabilize the situation in chechnya
the russia-chechnya peace deal has not resolved the all-important question of chechnya's political status chechnya runs its own affairs and considers itself independent but moscow insists the territory is still part of russia
president nelson mandela will visit moscow in the near future russian and south african diplomats said monday
deputy foreign affairs minister aziz pahad and his russian counterpart viktor posuvalyuk met in pretoria to discuss the visit and other issues _ including economic cooperation
there is a potential for growth in our bilateral relations our businessmen need to get to know one another posuvalyuk told reporters
he said mutual interests included mining and fishing
pahad told reporters that the situation in the middle east reform of the united nations and the forthcoming nonaligned movement summit to be held in south africa were also discussed
the date of mandela's visit would be announced in moscow the russian diplomat said
despite international warnings to stop stalling the polarized bosnian serb parliament failed monday to elect a new premier and government
the assembly did make one small step forward it re-elected dragan kalinic an ally of war crimes suspect radovan karadzic as parliament speaker and chose his deputies that allowed the parliament to formally establish itself
deputies loyal to karadzic have been blocking the election of a more moderate candidate for the premiership nominated by president biljana plavsic and supported by the international community
on monday they claimed that technicalities were to blame for preventing them from electing 39-year-old economist mladen ivanic he was not allowed to present his proposed governing program in the assembly's formal session however he was given a chance to speak to individual deputies
this could indicate room for compromise that might lead to his election at the next session which is scheduled for jan 17 the optimism was mainly because of reports that yugoslav president slobodan milosevic the serb's chief patron had started backing ivanic
plavsic kalinic and karadzic ally momcilo krajisnik headed to milosevic's capital belgrade after the session for consultations with the yugoslav president
plavsic and karadzic followers are locked in a power struggle that has divided bosnian serbs and blocked functioning of the 49 percent of bosnia they control
on sunday the top international official in bosnia warned the serbs there would be consequences if they kept stalling westendorp has the power to appoint a temporary government
westendorp said after monday's session that he was happy the parliament had been constituted with its officials but on the other it is a pity that that there was no agreement on the prime minister today he said
the bosnian serb parliament was elected last november in a vote that broke karadzic supporters' grip on power but the hardliners responded by blocking plavsic who has broken with karadzic and favors closer adherence to the dayton peace agreement
the first post-election parliament session ended in disarray last month after the two factions failed to agree on a wide range of issues
karadzic's party and the allied extreme nationalist radicals hold 39 seats in the 83-member assembly plavsic's party holds 15 seats but has support from two smaller serb parties and also hopes for backing from 18 deputies representing muslim and croat refugees from serb territory that would give her 44 seats which is a majority
muslim and croat support for plavsic would be exploited by her opponents who already brand her a traitor to the serb cause so she is not keen to enlist their backing
westendorp on sunday indicated he would make use of his authority to appoint a temporary government if disagreements continue to block election of ivanic
karadzic loyalists reject ivanic because he is a moderate who is ready to cooperate with muslims and croats and international officials in bosnia

i only attended primary school for six years after that when i turned 13 i started training as a temple sculptor says ps subramaniam
my training under sinnadurai reknowned tamil nadu temple sculptor lasted six years of which two were devoted entirely to drawing he adds
neither his knife-like tool nor his words falter as he talks while deftly working details into the statue he is modelling
subramianiam 28 is a temple sculptor stabadhi from tamil nadu in india and was here with a team of artisans to work on temple renovations in various parts of the country
now lending his skills to the vinayagar temple in rawang this father of an only son worked on the ramayana statuary in batu caves three years ago
subramaniam was born into a family of sculptors in nagapatnam tamil nadu his father grandfather and great-grandfather before him had all been sculptors
it was only natural that i take up the family trade in deference to tradition and i am very happy doing what i do best
his working hours are 830am to 6pm with a lunch break from one to two in the afternoon he works six days a week food and lodging is provided by whichever temple he is working for temple grounds constitute his studio
subramaniam excels in sculpting figures of hindu deities birds and beasts when i met him he was at work on a statue of durgai amman seated on a lion the lion with its long mane looked so real i felt all it needed was the breath of life to send it leaping and roaring around the temple
to create a statue subramaniam first makes a rough model of it with thick wire he then builds on the model with a mixture of cement coarse sand and broken bits of red brick this rough image is left to dry for two or three days
next subramaniam slaps cement plaster on the model and this time he shapes the statue to its exact proportions lastly while the plaster is still wet he sculpts the finer details for this he has no less than 50 small metallic and wooden instruments at his disposal depending on the size of the statue it takes subramaniam a week to complete each image later a painter will paint the statues
to subramaniam the money is not important he is by no means rich it is the job satisfaction that counts you can see by the way he lovingly moulds and shapes his looks intense his hands moving dexterously with a trowel over the plaster to produce exquisite statuary
on parting i ask this young man whether he will in future pass on his skills to his son and whether he expects his son to carry on the trade
the artisan replied with a resounding yes to both questions
but what if your son insists on pursuing a different career i ask
in that case subramaniam concedes gracefully i shall let him have his way after all there are already some sculptors who have taken up other vocations
wisely said subramaniam for a member of a caste that frowns upon those breaking out of the mould

harvard economist jeffrey sachs who has blamed the international monetary fund for aggravating asia's financial crisis expects recovery for the region by next year
he said although the problems facing south-east asia are serious once the 1997 currency depreciations have percolated through the economy the well-known export process of the region will show itself again
the director of the harvard institute of international development said this year will see the region displaying two faces a construction sector still mired in financial difficulties and a vibrant export sector
by 1999 the growing parts of the economy will easily outweigh those which are in difficulty he wrote in the economist's the world in 1998
sachs who took the imf to task last saturday said international institutions such as the bank for international settlements and the world bank need to do much more to help the regulatory environment of the emerging markets
he said they have not done enough to promote proper banking laws transparency of transaction or decent supervision
the broadest lesson for 1998 is positive however the emerging economies are determined to stick to the path of global integration no recent crises has led a country to withdraw from international trade and finance global integration is still proceeding apace
there is no better news for the world's future wealth sachs added
meanwhile the economist's asia editor paul markillie said 1998 will see an economic slowdown in the asian tigers
but the 1997 currency crisis will force changes that are for the good and within a couple of years the tigers will be leaping forward again he added
markillie said property development will slow to a snail's pace and the great cranes of progress will be still
however those countries that look the most miserable will be exactly those that come out smiling first
much will depend on the extent that individual governments are prepared to take hard decisions he said
markillie said the shock waves from the turmoil in the asian financial markets will continue through 1998
for one thing speculators will be testing to see if the tigers really are facing up to their problems and trying to get their houses in order
everywhere big infrastructure projects will be put on hold the lead has been taken by malaysia's prime minister datuk seri dr mahathir mohamad who has shelved many of his cherished but costly projects other asian countries will have to follow he added
reuter reports asian critics of the imf were gathering steam as the economic crisis intensified over the weekend hitting out at conditions attached to aid packages that were not working
the imf's position is to give an aspirin for every ailment said mr ajay kapur regional strategist at ubs securities
they dug into their little medicine kit and started handing out aspirins and that is the problem
the imf applied inappropriate conditions to asia because it relied on its experience with nations in latin america and africa where economies were characterised by raging inflation high budget deficits and public sector debt analysts said
mr martin khor director of international policy group third world network wrote in the latest edition of the far eastern economic review that the imf did not understand asia
regardless of accusations of cronyism governments in this region can on the whole boast of balanced budgets low public debt levels and high savings rates
rather than the wrecked national economies typical of nations under imf guidance elsewhere asia's problems lay in the private sector with private businesses responsible for building up mountains of foreign-denominated corporate debt
the imf has failed said one hong kong economist

so you haven't had enough of innuendo here's a piece of good news
the guys - reymee pot taj and sam who managed to stay among the top 10 spots in the recording industry of malaysia rim international chart along with recording artistes from other parts of the world for quite some time - have just released their second single if i could
for the uninitiated the guys' first single just for you/so good inside was released in may last year a month before the debut album hit the market
six months after the album release innuendo chalked up sales of over 30000 units a good record for a local english album
the figure is still climbing and if i could is viewed as one of the group's efforts to remain a force to reckon with in the industry
the new single has if i could in four different versions - radio edit groove mix endo feel rev/fwd mix - plus a minus-one track
the single also includes belaian jiwa's minus-one track is it a good buy you bet
still haven't had enough of the four guys check out these websites designed by innuendo's fans at http//wwwgeocities com/broadway/stage/9424 http//wwwgeocities com/southbeach/pier/6629 http//wwwxoom com/innuendo http//memberstripod com/-aishah-mi/inuendohtml http//wwwgeocities com/soho/gallery/6836/innuendohtml okay okay enough of them let's move on to other business shall we
reviews ning - always bmg with each album ning matures and always is a further testimony of this this is definitely her best work to date the album has all the right songs and comfortable elements that make it a very good listen
some people may question why she is singing so many cover versions in this one but they've all been reworked
in fact they sound pretty good
the first track human originally sung by human league sees ning in a very confident position as with the second song always originally sung by pebbles
the producers quite a number of them especially hari haze krish menon know what they're doing and the layers of ning's voice that form formidable harmonies as back-up throughout always is certainly very interesting the vocal arrangements somehow subdue ning's trademark wailing and whooping while enhancing the overall performance
performance amien - hidayah polygram worry not this is quite a good discovery
amien is blessed with a wonderful voice that manages to capture the spirit of the album - about redemption and commitment to one's religion
what makes hidayah engaging apart from amien's vocals is its simple and uncluttered music arrangement everything is kept to the minimal
there are several tracks that might remind one of raihan though especially those with steve thornton's touch the same person who is behind raihan's engaging sound like fitrah and antara kau dan aku
two songs - ya muhaimin and seruan - are sung in arabic and amien carries the tunes really well given the ramadhan mood one could easily expect amien's album sales to be pretty strong
performance various artistes - nostalgia emas life records the craze for the collections of songs from yesteryear continues this particular project contains 16 songs that added colour to the music business in the eighties with a slight twist
instead of offering sentimental tunes and sappy ballads like some of the projects already out in the market - and selling very well at that nostalgia emas lines up songs that are more upbeat
they include blues gang's classic apo nak di kato flybait's keindahan alam discovery's berilah ku suatu tanda sweet charity's jangan lama lama and alleycat's hingga akhir nanti
still the album makes a good listen this is something that could bring you back to those good old days if you were ever there
performance 1/2 3 gees - 3 gees emi the girls are still around fresh from the failure of their earlier group genuine they are left with no option but to sing dangdut remixes with lots of sampling and programming that do not seem to have the right punch the type that only amelina could provide
to begin with the trio do not seem to have what it takes to be dangdut singers they seem to flip from mainstream style to makeshift dangdut lenggok from song to song which causes the whole album to come across as a half-hearted effort and that's rather unnerving
even the remake of bergadang is not as happening as the sakura teng's version still one suspects that out there somewhere some dangdut clubs are spinning 3 gees tunes
performance 1/2 ratings excellent very good good fair poor copyright 1998 new straits times all rights reserved as distributed by worldsources online inc

lawyers for detained former president kenneth kaunda on monday alleged the government tried to kill the veteran politician and even planned national mourning for him
sebastian zulu told the lusaka high court that the shooting of kaunda during an opposition rally in august in the town of kabwe was an assassination attempt to remove him from zambia's political life kaunda was injured during the shooting
four days before the kabwe shooting the government had already prepared a period of national mourning for zambia's founding father zulu said
no other details were available
kaunda led zambia to independence from britain in 1964 and ruled virtually unchallenged until president frederick chiluba defeated him in 1991 in the nation's first multiparty elections
kaunda 73 a major figure in the opposition coalition was arrested dec 25 on suspicion that he helped plan a failed coup in october
the allegations were part of a private court action brought by kaunda to force the government to either file formal charges or release him
the government said saturday that kaunda and fellow opposition leaders roger chongwe and dean mung'omba promised to pay over 20 million kwacha dlrs 14000 to three junior army officers to carry out the coup
the charges were made in documents signed by aldridge adamson secretary to chiluba's cabinet
kaunda has denied the allegations
in october junior officers stormed the state broadcast center and claimed to have overthrown chiluba

prime minister benjamin netanyahu's parliamentary coalition managed only a tie against an opposition no-confidence motion monday reflecting the government's precarious political situation
former foreign minister david levy voted with the opposition as did four of the five members of his gesher faction cementing their break with the coalition after levy resigned last week
the 54-54 tie in the 120-seat parliament fell short of the absolute majority of 61 needed to topple the government
netanyahu said he was satisfied that the government survived the opposition didn't get a majority they didn't topple the government and they won't topple the government he said
but the tie underscored netanyahu's extremely difficult political situation eight days before he is due in washington to meet president clinton who expects a concrete offer on israel's long-delayed west bank troop pullback
in his speech to the knesset centrist lawmaker yehuda harel said his third way party's continued support for netanyahu was conditional of implementation of the pullback promised in the israel-plo accords
but a group of over 15 rightist legislators are threatening to bolt netanyahu's coalition if the pullback goes through
the situation leaves netanyahu with little maneuvering room noting opposition lawmaker yossi beilin
netanyahu won't be able to continue his term in the coming months beilin said he will have to resign or be toppled we are preparing ourselves for next elections
many israeli commentators believe netanyahu's goal is to gain time in hopes circumstances will somehow change
an emerging strategy appears geared toward this officials suggest the cabinet will decide on the pullout but on condition the palestinians fulfil a series of demands _ and only implement the decision after another vote in several months if they comply
the question is whether this will satisfy all the parties involved the palestinians the americans coalition centrists and coalition rightists
still netanyahu's reputation as a skilled political operator remains intact for the moment he has weathered last week's dramatic resignation of levy who accused the government of abandoning the peace process and pursuing ruinous social policy
monday's no-confidence motion was introduced by the opposition labor and meretz parties over what they said was netanyahu's failed social and economic policy
three coalition legislators were abroad and three likud rebels _ former cabinet ministers dan meridor and benny begin as well as legislator david reem _ absented themselves to show their displeasure with netanyahu

the world health organization on monday urged people to eat fresh fruit and vegetables to prevent cancer rather than taking beta-carotene pills to combat the disease
the pills may even increase the risk of lung cancer and cardiovascular disease for smokers said the un agency which recommended against promotion of the pills as a cancer-prevention remedy
some 23 scientists from 10 countries meeting under who auspices made the recommendation after studying all the published data on the health effects of so-called carotenoids including beta carotene the vegetable form of vitamin a
the agency's finding is in line with us studies that have found that pills containing beta carotene may lack the cancer-fighting effectiveness of the fruits and vegetables from which it is derived
it appears at present that cancer prevention by fresh fruits and vegetables remains more effective than taking one or several of their constituents as dietary supplements said dr harri vainio a who specialist
the pill lacks the fiber and other elements found in a carrot which may be the reason for the difference vainio said
a statement from who noted that many studies in different countries over the past two decades have shown that a diet rich in fruits and vegetables lowers the risk of developing cancer
this has led to a widespread belief that plant compounds such as the beta carotene found in carrots broccoli and cantaloupe can help protect against cancer it added
more research needs to be done in order to understand the mechanisms by which beta carotene might be acting vainio said
an adult eating fruits and vegetables might typically consume each day 2 milligrams to 3 milligrams of beta carotene many multivitamins contain about 6 milligrams and tests have included people taking 50 milligrams every other day
among the studies reviewed by the scientists who met in lyon france last month were clinical trials in which high doses of beta carotene were administered to reduce the incidence of cancer in healthy populations
in none of these trials did the drug have a significant preventive effect said vainio chief of the chemoprevention unit at who's international agency for research on cancer based in lyon
our working group came to the conclusion that until further information becomes available on how beta carotene and other carotenoids influence the processes leading to cancer none of these substances should be promoted to the general population as a tumor-preventive treatment he said
he said us and finnish studies have indicated that men who smoke heavily may have an 18 percent to 20 percent increased risk of lung cancer or death from cardiovascular disease if they also take beta carotene dietary supplements

penang sun - it is that time of the year when employees usually receive bonuses but what about the self-employed penang fishermen have their own way of getting a bonus
they raise the prices of large prawns and chinese pomfret - which is popular during the festive season with seafood enthusiasts - and make their bonus the price of large prawns has been raised from rm30 per kg to rm50 per kg as part of this exercise to provide new year bonuses for fishermen the price of pomfret is expected to increase soon
the penang inshore fishermen's welfare association treasurer amran omar told the new straits times consumers might even have to pay as much as rm70 per kg for large prawns when the festive season draws closer
he said the practice was an annual exercise to give the poor fishermen some raya bonus and it is carried out for a full month before the chinese new year
this is because pomfret and large prawns are popular ingredients on the shopping list of chinese preparing for their reunion dinners
amran said the fishermen had to resort to increasing the prices prior to the festive season because it was the only time for them to earn extra income
this year however we have yet to raise the price of bawal tambak as there is a bit of a glut at the moment and the economy is not very good
amran said however that since jan 1 the price of large prawns which is usually about rm30 per kg had been raised by over 60 per cent
closer to the double festival we expect it to be raised to between rm60 and r70 per kg between 100 and 130 per cent increase he said
meanwhile he said grade a bawal tambak which is now retailing at about rm65 per kg might be raised to about rm75 per kg
grade b bawal tambak which normally retails for about rm55 per kg may be increased to about rm70 per kg while the price of grade cmay shoot up from rm40 to rm60 per kg
it is learnt that coupled with the price hike prices of other seafood like crabs have also gone up due to increased exports
a us congressman who has long supported independence for the nagorno-karabakh enclave in azerbaijan called monday for international recognition of the disputed territory
rep frank pallone a democrat from new jersey spoke before the parliament of the mountainous region which is located inside azerbaijan but populated mostly by ethnic armenians
according to the armenian assembly of america which sponsored his trip the congressman said there was a morally compelling case for the self-determination and self-government of the people of nagorno-karabakh
however azerbaijan says it will not allow the territory to secede
pallone commended the us congress and president clinton for approving dlrs 125 million in humanitarian aid for the enclave the armenian group said
the congressman also met with armenian government officials in yerevan before returning to the united states on monday pallone made a similar trip to the region a year ago
armenia and azerbaijan two neighboring former soviet republics fought for years over control of nagorno-karabakh ethnic armenians now control the territory and hundreds of thousands of azerbaijanis fled their homes despite a 1994 truce efforts to reach a political settlement have failed

frechette who speaks english french and spanish said there was a crying need for greater attention to economic and social development issues and to help define the proper role for the united nations on these kind of issues
frechette said the united nations must also re-examine its role in international peacekeeping operations - the high profile missions which have
fallen out of favor in washington and some other capitals after disastrous performances in somalia bosnia and rwanda

reforms to address concerns of the united states and other member states about inefficiency within the un system

it was hot and dusty as we walked along the wide dirt tracks in the cite lamy neighbourhood we passed by a kindergarten where children were singing in the principal african language of wolof
a small herd of goats coming from the opposite direction bleated their protest at being hurried along by their goatherd the villagers stared at us curiously
true occasionally they have visitors from other parts of senegal wanting to know more about their successful household waste management project but this group of strangers armed with notebooks cameras and tape recorders looked far too international
in fact the group comprised journalists from several countries as well as officials from the united nations development programme undp who were visiting a few grassroots projects to fight poverty and improve livelihoods in the west african country last december
cite lamy is one of the cleanest neighbourhoods in thies the country's second largest town which is 70km east of the federal capital of dakar
where previously household waste was either buried in the villagers' compounds strewn on streets or dumped as far away as the children could carry cite lamy's garbage is today systematically collected and sifted so that part of it can be used to produce compost some of the compost is then used for market gardening and nursery projects while the rest is sold off
this low-cost project was proposed planned and implemented by people in the community with guidance from rodale international a non-governmental organisation and funding from the undp through its life local initiative facility for urban environment programme
though a seemingly small step in the grand scheme of things this project has brought the community closer together built a sense of self-reliance and ownership as well as improved the living environment of this low-income settlement jobs have also been created for those involved in collecting and sifting through the garbage
managed and led by women the project also covers two other nearby residential areas diamaguene and medina fall
leading us through the neighbourhood was fatou diakhate head of cite lamy's sanitation committee a tall and well-built woman fatou was dressed in a flowing green and black boubou a traditional costume which consists of an outer kaftan-like robe and inner skirt with a matching headdress
we're very thankful for this project says fatou in her native wolof
our village is now much cleaner and diseases like cholera and malaria have decreased because of this we would like to have more carts for collecting rubbish right now we've only two carts two horses and nine workers
each household pays 750 francs cfa rm690 a month for its rubbish to be collected
we waited patiently as this information was first translated into french and then english as we walked along we came across khady ba and her family standing outside the doorway of their mud brown house marked villa ba the ba family with three teenage children is one of the 230 households in cite lamy that benefit from this garbage collection service
shyly she gave the thumbs-up to the project
the sanitation committee was initially set up to establish a proper sewage system for the neighbourhood that includes the building of ventilated improved pit latrines
when others see that our compounds are much cleaner because the rubbish is properly disposed of they too want to have their rubbish collected
now we've got a waiting list of families wanting our service added fatou who in her voluntary post as committee chief is responsible for recruiting and paying the workers
in diamaguene the head of the sanitation committee yacine fall showed us a little coin pouch and a key-holder that fellow villagers had woven out of strips cut from plastic bags retrieved from rubbish heaps
from this project women are also being trained to recycle plastic waste we make handbags and shoes out of the plastic we collect these things are then sold we hope to start a community shop and self-help savings and credit facility sometime in the future said yacine
out in the open countryside on a 25-hectare piece of land donated by the village chief rodale international's director wore seck showed us several concrete pits that were purpose built to make compost
a young man was watering some budding sunflowers several others were drawing water from a nearby well
making compost here is still at the experimental stage right now our workers have to sift through the garbage for recycleable stuff like plastic metal and glass eventually we hope to encourage the villagers to sort out their own rubbish said wore a capable woman keen on helping fellow senegalese at the community level
with her double master's in environment and agro-business from the university of arizona in the united states wore is also a source of technical support for the locals
in a country where life expectancy is 49 years for men and 51 years for women creating a clean environment is a good start to improving living conditions
nato has no position at this time regarding croatia's aspirations to join the partnership for peace program the nato supreme commander said monday
on his first official visit to croatia nato supreme commander gen wesley clark met with croatian defense minister gojko susak to discuss mutual security interests and croatia's further cooperation with nato forces in bosnia
clark told reports that susak had raised the issue of croatia becoming a partnership for peace member but said that there is no position on that at this time
croatia is already a member of the council of europe and is eager to be admitted into the european union and partnership for peace
but the united states and its allies have repeatedly told the former yugoslav republic that first it must fully comply with the dayton peace agreement for bosnia and improve its human rights and media records
clark emphasized that croatia must fulfill all of its responsibilities that it signed for in dayton croatia signed the dayton accord on behalf of bosnian croats whom it supported during the 3 1/2 years of war in bosnia
officials say they still don't know who bit a rugby player's ear in a match over the weekend but names of suspects have begun to surface
australian simon fenn of the london scottish club needed 25 stitches _ and may yet need skin grafts _ to close the wound from saturday's match at bath
london scottish monday named three bath players it suspects and filed a complaint with the rugby football union the london club also called for a 12-month ban against the guilty and asked for compensation
the three cited by london scottish are england props kevin yates and victor ubogu and argentine hooker federico mendez
the 26-year-old fenn speaking monday for the first time about the incident said he was at the bottom of a collapsed scrum when it happened and called on the guilty to come forward
i have never experienced anything like that on a rugby field and initially it was a shock said fenn who could be sidelined as long as three months
i am pretty certain who it was and i hope they come forward if i was him i would own up he added i am surprised it has taken him so long to do it
bath officials meanwhile say they won't comment until they finish their investigation
the club is fully aware of its responsibilities to all parties in this regard said bath chief executive tony swift
we feel it would be dreadfully irresponsible of us to enter into any public speculation as to the nature of the incident before we have been able to examine all available evidence the evidence we have so far is inconclusive
london scottish chief executive richard yerbury said he was supplying bath with a video of the game and other photographs
we felt that the incident's seriousness called for rfu involvement although i realize pressure on bath must be enormous
of the three cited yates has been named in england's squad for a pre-five nations championship at bisham abbey on wednesday
mendez sent off for punching england lock paul ackford at twickenham in 1990 joined bath from south african provincial side natal 12 months ago
ubogu won the last of his 21 caps against south africa in november 1995 having played throughout england's world cup campaign earlier that year

kuala lumpur sun - fifty per cent of the 800000 bills issued by indah water konsortium which run into a few million ringgit have not been settled and the company fears that this will disrupt plans to improve sewerage treatment plants nationwide
iwk assistant general manager for communication randhir singh johl said the payments received so far did not match the expenditure incurred by the company last year
he however declined to reveal the total payment collected so far
randhir told the new straits times that the refusal of users to pay up could derail the success of the refurbishment exercise a vital component under the country's sewerage privatisation programme
its success will contribute towards a safer environment protect water sources besides keeping away water-borne diseases such as cholera and hepatatis a
it has to be carried out for the benefit of all we cannot compromise the future he said
he said bills for july to december last year would be sent out by this month urging customers to pay up promptly
randhir said iwk had also written off rm256 million following a review of the sewerage charges and services in november 1996
in line with the government's decision iwk credited all payments made before jan 1 1997 to future sewerage bills and cancelled all arrears accummulated before that
this resulted in rm256 million being written off which in essence means we have provided free service for 33 months he said
the new rates for domestic users are rm2 rm3 rm6 or rm8 a month and are fixed according to various categories like low-cost units new villages and estates depending on the type of property
the charges for commercial industrial and government properties are still calculated partly on property value and water consumption
bills are now issued directly by iwk - every six months for domestic users and monthly for commercial industrial and government buildings - after the old method where charges were included in the water bills came under heavy criticism
randhir said the economic problems due to the depreciation of the ringgit was also expected to increase the financial burden on plans to refurbish the plants as required under the concession agreement
he said the rm357 million budgeted for the exercise was expected to increase as most of the aeration equipment and sewage pumps had to be imported
the sewerage industry is relatively new in malaysia and we do not have local manufacturers
the pumps costing between rm7000 and rm200000 will naturally cost more now
to date he said iwk had invested rm73 million in the upgrading of 350 plants while another 733 were in various stages of refurbishment
it costs between rm35000 and several millions to refurbish a plant depending on its size and condition the job takes between eight and 15 months to complete
under the agreement randhir said the company was originally expected to take over only 1800 plants but to date it had assummed responsibility over 4400 of them
some of these plants are in a terrible state as they have just been discovered no one knew of their existence earlier he said
prior to the privatisation of the sewerage service all matters pertaining to sewerage were under the jurisdiction of the country's 144 local authorities which lacked the funding skill and technical know-how in providing sewerage services
randhir said these factors led to most of the plants being sub-standards iwk expected the refurbishment exercise for the remaining 3317 plants to be completed in four years
on nov 19 local government and housing minister datuk dr ting chew peh said 60 per cent of iwk's 4400 or 2640 sewerage treatment plants were not fit to meet the department of environment's effluent standard
on the refurbishment exercise randhir said it is a very ambitious programme and with the assistance of the local communities and the relevent government agencies iwk is confident it can be done
he said iwk had submitted a new strategy on the exercise to the department of sewerage services and the doe which among others would see refurbishment being done on a priority basis depending on their locality and importance

at the mines resort city's buy local exhibition a prejudiced hisham harun has a change of heart on seeing the quality products on display he has one complaint though he finds several items still way too expensive
are these really local that was the first thing that crossed my mind when admiring the exquisite queen-sized nyatoh bed and pretty blue printed leather settee on display
of course even as i asked myself this question - while closely examining the items to reassure myself of the quality - i already knew the answer
after all i was at a three-month made-in-malaysia fair at the mines resort city exhibition hall sungai besi kuala lumpur
much as i hate to admit it my reaction shows my bias towards foreign goods honestly had i not seen the products here i would not have guessed they were manufactured locally
i wasn't the only one who thought so my colleague hamsiah abu bakar shared these sentiments as she said aloud they are nice aren't they
in a give-away tone that revealed she too expected some really inferior malaysian-made goods
yes it was obvious that like many others we suffered note the past tense from the foreign-is-better syndrome let us tell you however that this exhibition has somewhat helped cure us of the disease and we'd like to recommend fellow malaysians with the same ailment to come and seek treatment here too
in fact you could say many of the beautiful things we came across at this love malaysia buy malaysian products campaign fair initiated by country heights holdings bhd had us quite excited
at the moment about 60 per cent of the products on display by some 60 participants consist of furniture and household items of these most are sofa sets dining tables cupboards and cabinets curtains writing desks and drawers book shelves and display cases
there are also spring and latex beds bathroom equipment office equipment porcelain vases carpets leather car seats and cereals and other local foodstuff
electrical appliances include refrigerators television computers air-conditioning sets home-theatre systems and hi-fi sets and video and compact-disc players
and as you walk about the 200000 square feet area on the ground floor of this exhibition hall you will also get to see good oil and acrylic art pieces by artists like rafiee ghani and anuar dan and sculptures priced between a few hundred to a few thousand ringgit
hamsiah and i seemed to share similar tastes and found ourselves admiring almost the same items - a well-crafted solid-looking book shelf several wrought iron consoles in sunflower design and side tables with intricate filligree and arabesque patterns a pretty checked sofa in green and pink bold black and white striped sofa beds and display cases made from hard and heavy nyatoh wood
we also liked the assortment of simple garden and rattan lazy chairs the rattan and wooden dividing panels and quite a number of rubberwood dining table sets
there was one little regret though as we went around remarking how fabulous they would look in our homes we found ourselves as frequently exclaiming mahalnya so expensive
we noticed that a favourite word among our retailers was competitive prices but when we need not import quality wood like nyatoh merbau ramin membatu and rubberwood as we have them in abundance why do we still have to pay a bomb for the finished goods
i thought the rm6000 price tag for the nyatoh bed i liked was a bit too high since it was designed and manufactured here much of the other furniture also came with italian-furniture-type prices
oh but i think a customer can negotiate on price if he is serious about buying khalid abdullah general manager of mines explained
maybe the prices on the tags are just a show he speculated
whether show or not why should this be why can't manufacturers work towards making the phrase cheap and good a reality for locals
and what's the logic in buying something local that is just as expensive or as the retailers put it competitive in price with foreign goods when the latter is often the more established
maybe some of our manufacturers should start learning to respect us more if they want our support in return then probably in time some of them will not be too afraid or embarrassed to come out in the open and tell the public that they are a local company
we encountered this experience in the midst of doing our give our local goods a chance article published last year a leather goods manufacturer who did not want to be included in the article said we don't want to be known as a local brand locals will stop buying our products
it's sad that some of these manufacturers have somehow failed to notice that local consumers are not an unthinking lot if the quality is good and the price is right we buy hasn't proton which has the lion's share of the car market proven this year after year ever since it was introduced late 1985
on a happier note it was nice to see that there are still manufacturers like salam technology m sdn bhd which retail their electronic products at prices which are 20 to 50 per cent lower than imported goods
for instance salam technology is distributing 29-inch television sets under the nikom brand for about rm1600 as compared to others which are retailing at rm2200 or more
salam technology's air-conditioners computers and home-theatre systems are also much cheaper than rival companies' what's more it offers the same guarantee you get from overseas competitors
most of our products are 100 per cent made in malaysia we also manufacture our spare parts here for the past two years the company has been exporting to kazakhstan russia and several other countries in the middle east
we started manufacturing for the local market about a year ago the response has been overwhelming now we need to triple our production capacity said sales co-ordinator amir suhaimi
so here's proof again that when something is good and the price is right malaysians will buy
the mines' khalid explained that it is trying to accommodate 40 more participants for the exhibition where there will be sales on particular days
besides trying to promote malaysian products to locals we are also assisting manufacturers - in particular small and medium-sized industries - export their merchandise to show our support we have waived rental for three months
to inculcate the buy malaysian habit in the young schools could also organise trips to this wonderful exhibition which will go on until the end of march at least this is a good avenue to teach our children to appreciate malaysian quality and help them realise that malaysia is indeed bagus starting next thursday hisham will keep us updated on more local goods and manufacturers in a weekly column called sen and sensibility

johor baru sun - the government will cut down the number of foreign movies and shows screened locally as part of the effort to reduce cost information minister datuk seri mohamed rahmat said
under the cost-cutting plan mohamed said the ministry would reduce the purchase of new foreign programmes and instead encourage the screening of re-runs this year
the new plan is pertinent and will help the country reduce expenditure and recover from its present economic situation
the decision is in line with the 40 per cent budget cut the ministry has imposed on all its departments including the radio dan televisyen malaysia he said
the ministry also urged local film companies and broadcasting houses to utilise local settings and materials in their productions
mohamed said rtm would give priority to companies which produced their shows locally
over the years many firms have been using locations overseas for filming purposes and engaged foreign companies to produce their shows
this is not healthy for our currency
speaking to reporters after launching the pulai umno division internet homepage mohamed said companies offering discounts on prices and sponsorship would also be given priority
the ministry spent an annual sum of rm200 million for the purchase of television programmes screened over rtm and this year the budget has been cut to rm160 million
a blind man who drove two miles while drunk before crashing into a parked car escaped jail monday after his lawyer told the court the man was terrified of what might happen to him there
peter langley pleaded guilty at a devon magistrates court to driving while nearly two and half times over the alcohol limit
with three previous drunken driving convictions the magistrates considered sending langley to prison but his lawyer pleaded with them not to langley 40 who suffers from glaucoma is completely blind in one eye and suffers tunnel vision in the other
a severely disabled person thrown into prison is likely to be the butt of all sorts of things defense attorney john darby said
the magistrates put langley on two years' probation on the condition that he seek alcoholic counseling and fined him 100 pounds dlrs 161 by law they also had to ban him from driving for three years
the owner of the parked car had witnessed the crash from his window and called the police who tested langley's alcohol level
my client never intended to drive but both he and his partner had been drinking and she wasn't fit to drive darby told the court
he was concerned with his failing eyesight about wandering around the streets in the dark the lawyer said this is where stupidity took over
european union nations should meet soon to coordinate efforts in fighting the spread of doping in today's sports the italian government said monday
deputy premier walter veltroni made the suggestion in a letter to british sports minister chris smith whose country now holds the rotating eu presidency
the cases that have come to light recently raise again with added urgency the problem of doping wrote veltroni who also serves as sports and culture minister
veltroni's letter was sent the same day that the italian olympic committee's antidoping commission delayed ruling on the case of mountain biker paola pezzo the olympic and world cup champion tested positive at a race in september for nadrolone a banned steroid
in another recent case vials containing human growth hormone a banned substance were seized from the luggage of a chinese athlete en route to the world swimming championships in perth australia last week the woman and a chinese coach left the championships
with the latest examples of the problem i think it is opportune that the 15 eu countries pursue tighter cooperation on the various aspects of the spread of doping in today's sports veltroni said

malaysia's first digital terrestrial broadcasting network nat tv 7 ntv7 will incorporate state-of-the-art technology and sophisticated digital systems which are set to position the network apart from present television networks
ntv7's chairman datuk effendi norwawi said an estimated rm150 million has been invested in setting up the network infrastructure and the necessary digital equipment and computer hardware and software applications
according to him some of the advanced digital equipment that will be utilised at ntv7's broadcasting centres nationwide are the flourical full automation processing system video server recorder betacam sx full featured nicam stereo equipment and focus total vision
effendi explained that all the equipment sit on a sophisticated server-based system that allows multi-tasking which includes daily scheduling editing commercial and in-house database management dual-language programming previewing and subtitling censorship and commercial billings
besides the digital betacam the sony digital beta sx system format allows integrated non-tape-based editing capability to offer high-quality output and added features for faster playback speed
effendi added that ntv7 has also completed installations of the broadcast management software for airtime and advertising management system
this system will facilitate up-to-the-minute status of current advertising bookings this implies more flexibility in airtime advertising management meanwhile integrating the software with ntv7's automation system can speed up advertisement bookings while generating other features and benefits for the advertisers he said in kuala lumpur last week
effendi added that by virtue of ntv7 being a multi-lingual broadcasting network it will focus on the quality of its program content initially only 35 per cent of the programmes will have local content and plans have been made to increase this to about 65 per cent
for nationwide coverage natv will have two fully digitalised broadcasting centres one each in shah alam and kuching to cater to the peninsular malaysia and sabah and sarawak respectively
to complement these two centres 10 stations will be put in place under phase one and the transmission will be received by a majority of towns and cities nationwide these stations will be located at gunung jerai in kedah gunung keledang in perak menara kuala lumpur and gunung ulu kali in genting highlands
the remaining stations will be located at bukit telapa burok in negri sembilan gunung ledang and gunung pulai in johor serapi in sarawak bukit karatong in sabah and bukit pelindung pahang
phase two involves the plan to set up more transmission stations to extend ntv7's coverage to sibu bintulu miri kota baru and kuala terengganu by the end of this year

in terms of initial public offers 1997 kicked off with a bang and ended with a whimper
while ipos in the beginning yielded astronomical premiums over offer prices by april the stock market had claimed its first victim - seacorp-schroder smallcap fund bhd
the counter was the first of 10 to be listed at a discount when it opened at only 80 sen against the offer price of rm1
by the second half of the year it was apparent that the heydays of hefty listing premiums that brought broad smiles on the faces of company directors at the sound of the gong were gone
investors too are unhappy that the stock market does not any longer give handsome profits
instead discounts and undersubscription have become the rule
while the klse has yet to see its first customer this year many in the business community as well as casual investors are not too optimistic that things are going to get better in the near future
more and more merchant bankers underwriters and companies are discussing other options to raise funds and some companies have called off their flotation exercise on the advice of their merchant bankers
coupled with the economic downturn and investors' pessimistic outlook delays in flotation exercises may become quite the norm this year
closed-end fund dana mutiara bhd was one which called off its listing plans when the shares were undersubscribed and failed to meet the minimum rm150 million total specified in its prospectus
a few other companies' shares were also undersubscribed but they chose to go ahead despite the poor public response
they are tap resources bhd mutiara swisscom bhd and patimas computers bhd all were listed at lower than the offer price except mutiara swisscom which made its debut at the offer price
other companies whose shares have yet to be balloted such as bumi hiway m bhd decided that it may be better to hold off on plans for a flotation until sentiments improved
in spite of these 1997 saw a higher quantum of funds raised through the kuala lumpur stock exchange compared to 1996
all in all a total of 88 companies joined the klse last year raising rm547 billion from the public twenty-five were main board counters while 63 were listed on the second board
in 1996 there were 92 issues which raised a total of rm386 billion while in 1995 51 counters were listed and raised a total of rm421 billion
kicking off listings for 1997 on the auspicious eighth day was second board company evermaster group bhd
its shares which were oversubscribed by 115 times opened on the klse at rm15 over the offer price of rm7 registering a premium of 114 per cent
other companies which saw their shares grossly oversubscribed by more than 100 times are magna prima bhd 18108 times widetech malaysia bhd 10738 times and pohmay holdings bhd 12570 times
the company which garnered some of the greatest support from investors was rubberex corporation bhd when its public offer was oversubscribed by 19488 times
ample liquidity in the market at the time also benefited hing yiap knitting industries bhd which recorded a 300 per cent premium when it made a triumphant entry into the klse in february at rm1320 over the offer price of rm330
other lucky debutants include zaitun bhd 2167 per cent len cheong holdings bhd 215 per cent and computer system advisers bhd 2142 per cent
women's intimate wear maker audrey international m bhd got a whopping 400 per cent premium upon listing at the opening bell it sold at rm10 over the offer price of rm2
there was no doubt that ipos were a prime source of easy money
but by the third quarter of last year the times were clearly changing
listing premiums started to shrink and shares available for ipos found few takers many companies had also revised downwards the prices of their rights issues
investors began to hold on to their cash even as it got more difficult to obtain finance for the purchase of shares
after seacorp-schroder the second to fall victim to the weak sentiment on the bourse was rhb sakura merchant bankers bhd in august when investors decided to cut their losses and sold their holdings below the offer price
altogether 10 counters registered discounts upon listing they are fiamma holdings bhd subur tiasa holdings bhd malaysian merchant marine bhd ucp resources bhd cck consolidated holdings bhd thb industries bhd cnlt far east bhd tap resources bhd and patimas computers bhd three counters opened at their offer price namely zecon engineering bhd amtel holdings bhd and mutiara swisscom bhd
the year also saw the entry of three more infrastructure project companies namely ytl power international bhd puncak niaga holdings bhd and mutiara swisscom
amidst all the excitement on the local bourse as well as other pressing economic issues to be grappled with the klse in august moved into its new headquarters at bukit kewangan in the heart of the capital
it also said goodbye to its executive chairman datuk nik mohamed din nik yusoff and welcomed datuk azlan hashim in his place
azlan has pledged to improve and enhance confidence in the stock market by working closely with the government
while investors may not be holding their breath for the next debutant on the klse they will be waiting to see what the new chairman will be remembered for during his tenure there

the malaysian trades union congress mtuc urged the government to step up food production so as to reduce the country's dependence on imported food and stem the outflow of foreign exchange
given the present difficult economic circumstances self-sufficiency in food production would have enabled us to prevent the outflow of millions of ringgit in foreign exchange mtuc president zainal rampak said in a statement released in kuala lumpur yesterday
he said attaining self-sufficiency in food production is important for malaysia in achieving a developed nation status by the year 2020
while the mtuc appreciates the efforts of the government to make malaysia an industrialised nation by placing great emphasis on manufaturing and high-technology industries we would also wish to remind the concerned authorities that almost all the developed and industrialised countries in the west are major food producers zainal said
these industrialised countries he said have not only been able to acquire sophisticated technology for their industries but also have been able to balance their industrial growth with increased food production
he said malaysia which was self-sufficent in rice production about ten years ago now has to import rice from thailand and pakistan as domestic production can only meet about 40 per cent of local needs
mtuc believes that if adequate attention had been given to the green book policy introduced by second prime minister tun abdul razak in the 70s malaysia would have continued to be self-sufficent in food production and need not have to import
the congress also called upon banks and other financial institutions to provide low-interest and flexible loans to farmers as a step to boost food production
mtuc said banks and financial institutions such as credit unions and cooperative societies can provide low interest and flexible loans to farmers and those who are keen to embark on farming activities such as rice growing vegetables and fruits poultry and dairy farming

after the christmas and new year holiday period london is returning to some semblance of normalcy traffic jams delayed trains crowded underground stations and post-christmas and new year sales in oxford street shops are making the headlines
to malaysians in london it is time to get together again for an exchange of news from home and the meeting place has become the malaysian-owned pavillion holiday villa hotel in bayswater
since the start of ramadan its legenda restaurant has been serving buka puasa buffet high tea/dinner and malaysians regardless of religious beliefs have been making a beeline for the variety of malaysian food
after all where else can one eat as much for just stg8 rm56
at the restaurant the main topics of conversation were not the value of the ringgit or the economic woes back home
let's not talk about it if you start converting you will not buy anything says an ipoh-born engineer
three malaysian students who had finished their engineering exams were there for what they described as a well-deserved expensive dinner after two weeks of studying
it had been a demanding period for the trio while most londoners were merry-making they were preparing for their exams
on new year's eve we were in our rooms we cooked ourselves a meal and ushered in 1998 watching the big ben chime 12 times on television said student wan ridwan
each had a tale to tell about their new year celebrations over air bandung and cincau
murugasu rajah a law student who works as a hotel receptionist in south kensington said he joined hotel guests at an impromptu party in the foyer of the hotel
it was too cold to go out besides when you are 7000 miles away from home it can be a bit lonely fortunately i welcomed the new year with people who were also away from home so it did not hurt very much
petaling jaya-born dr ramesan navaratnarajah a gynaecologist at a hospital in kent said he was put on call on alternate days because of the holiday period he was rostered to work on christmas day and dec 31
while those in the accident and emergency unit were busy with over-zealous merry makers who ended up accident victims early in the night the doctor had rather an easy evening but a little after midnight he had the honour of delivering the hospital's first new year baby three hours later he was in the labour ward delivering yet another baby
at 7am after handing over duties he returned to his bayswater apartment to sleep
in hounslow near heathrow airport a malaysian family welcomed 1998 in almost malaysian style
it was not an open house' like home but i invited a few friends to come over for home-cooked food said the malaysian who is studying for his master's in business administration
for his guests it was an opportunity to sample malaysian dishes
the dinner discussion at the legenda restuarant also touched on what to do for hari raya puasa and chinese new year it was finally agreed that everyone present contribute dishes for a pot-luck muhibbah celebration
mayhap it might be a little cheaper
a shootout on a moscow tram monday evening left one person dead and four hospitalized with gunshot wounds the interfax news agency said
the person who was killed took part in the shootout believed to be between rival gangs and the four wounded were passengers caught in the crossfire according to interfax citing police
police said they were looking for the gunmen

innovation has become a by-word in every economy from the least to the most developed technological change is thought to hold the cure for every economic failing from industrial stagnation and unemployment in europe to extreme poverty in africa yet the reality has often been a let-down not all countries can muster the right ingredients - big investments in manpower and resources and firm government leadership among others - for a wholesale shift into new modes of production in fact only asia has succeeded in making the modern technological model work the region has done this largely by keeping its costs low enough to be able to buy or license the needed technology from outside globalisation helped to supply that technology as well as the investments and markets for what has been called a miraculous leap from agriculture to industrial production
this achievement has been no less phenomenal in the light of recent events but with success has come drawbacks which will eventually alter asia's competitive structure like japan and south korea the rest of asia too is seeing costs inevitably rise the region must now work towards greater efficiency overall and this includes its own cost- effectiveness in the procurement and uptake of technology
in other words asia must carry its own weight in research and development this should not be confined to industry technological innovation can come in many forms shapes and sizes and need not cost a lot malaysia's smallness had been a distinct advantage earlier on when a clear emphasis on a few strategic sectors made it easier to focus its small r&ampd resources this was the case with rubber and palm oil for example where its leadership in production was matched by an equal standing in research although the country still retains that leadership in many downstream activities the commodity sector as a whole has seen its shine taken off by the very rapid industrial growth of the last decade or so
this as several leading scientists have pointed out has been a pity
rubber gloves tyres and palm oil products less glamorous than the hi-tech goodies from our brand-new factories are still areas in which we can stay ahead malaysia's move into new materials such as those that go into semiconductors has been fast and far-reaching but our pre-eminence in the more traditional sectors should not be allowed to dull even with the emergence of lower-cost producers nearby our peerless experience in such areas could continue long after the last rubber or oil palm smallholding becomes obsolete malaysia can lead in the development of end-products as well as in the industry's management financial and scientific expertise far into the future
innovation is no less applicable to agriculture than to industry
although results tend to flow fastest on the factory floor agricultural innovation can be just as profitable truck farming which took off in the late 1940s and 1950s in the united states to feed the huge population growth of the cities could do equally well in this country with fruit and vegetable agriculture and horticulture as innovative as they now are any little plot of land can be used for the growing of the perishables that urban markets consistently want rapid industrialisation has left idle a lot of the land opened for agricultural expansion in an earlier era now is as good a time as any to make proper use of it
brazil's and inter milan's star striker ronaldo was named fifa's player of the year for the second year in a row monday by an overwehelming majority
in an awards ceremony at disneyland paris the 21-year-old added the coveted trophy to a growing list of awards that he has won over the past year
he scored 480 points with 86 first-place votes from the 121 possible
ronaldo's brazilian teammate roberto carlos who plays for real madrid was a distant second with 65 votes just ahead of dutchman dennis bergkamp of arsenal and frenchman zinedine zidane who plays for juventus turin bergkamp and zidane scored 62 points
bergkamp received seven first place votes with carlos getting five
national team coaches from 121 countries voted for the title last year was closer ronaldo had 329 to liberian george weah second with 140
ronaldo became the first two-time winner of the world award which has only been given since 1991 previous winners were lothar matthaus of germany marco van basten of netherlands roberto baggio of italy romario of brazil and weah before ronaldo won for 1996
the trophy will be given at a gala banquet in the presence of such great players such as pele franz beckenbauer and sir bobby charlton who were among the initial inductees to the international soccer hall of champions presented by the sport's governing body fifa
beckenbauer whose defending skills help him win a world cup as both a coach and a player gave ringing praise to ronaldo
it's almost impossible to defend against him beckenbauer said he is so fast so skilled and has such a fine technique
there are other fast players but he is very fast and has excellent ball control with it he has the instinct to score goals the german said
ronaldo knows how to score goals especially in france at the all-star match before the world cup draw in marseille ronaldo scored three and easily set up two others
at the confederations cup final in saudi arabia where brazil routed australia he also scored three times
last month he was named the european player of the season after starring at fc barcelona and then transferring to inter milan in a reported dlrs 55 million deal after lazio of rome struggled to also obtain him
he has helped inter to first place and leads the league with 13 goals
ronaldo didn't exactly admit he has his eyes on frenchman's just fontaine's record of 13 goals in a world cup final phrase but ronaldo said with a team like brazil that gives you six or seven chances to score it's possible although the most important thing is to win the world cup
ronaldo said taking the title for 1996 helped him in 1997
winning last year in lisbon motivated me for this year to work even harder he said i am also young and it's a world cup year this year
his goal-getting skills have drawn frequent comparisons to soccer greats pele diego maradona and johan cruyff
the award ceremony also had the inductees for the international hall of champions which included 10 players two coaches a referee a pioneer real madrid as a club team brazil as a national team a media representative and a person for the good of the game
the players named included beckenbauer pele charlton eusebio johan cruyff alfredo di stefano sir stanley matthews michel platini ferenc puskas and lev yashin

the government yesterday confirmed that the foreign investment committee fic has reinstated the waiver granted to united engineers malaysia bhd uem from having to make a general offer for renong bhd shares
deputy prime minister and finance minister datuk seri anwar ibrahim who confirmed this said there will be no further investigation on the issue
unless there are new issues right now we are quite settled on the decision to reinstate the waiver to uem he told reporters after meeting former us secretary of state dr henry kissinger in kuala lumpur kissinger is in kuala lumpur to attend a two-day pacific dialogue which will be officially opened today by prime minister datuk seri dr mahathir mohamad
anwar was also asked whether the waiver was reinstated to uem following a thorough investigation into the controversial uem's plan to buy back shares belonging to renong its parent company
yes the decision was made as a result of the investigation the securities commission and the kuala lumpur stock exchange klse have submitted their respective reports to the economic planning unit the agency handling the fic
then they epu make this decision he said when asked to comment on news reports yesterday that the fic had reinstated the waiver granted to uem
asked whether the decision will be against the interest of minority shareholders anwar said this has been taken into consideration that is why there have been a lot of conditions imposed on this approval to grant the waiver
in a separate report commerce international merchant bankers bhd cimb has also disclosed over the weekend on behalf of uem that the fic has re- instated the waiver granted to united engineers malaysia bhd uem and parties acting in concert with it from having to make a general offer for renong bhd shares they do not already own
it said that fic re-instated the waiver on december 31 1997 in response to uem's appeal to the fic on december 13 1997
therefore uem is not obliged to extend a general offer for renong shares cimb added
it also announced that to reassure uem shareholders and to ensure that uem does not suffer any loss tan sri halim saad renong executive chairman and a director of uem has agreed to grant a put option to uem
to uem whereby uem can ask halim to acquire all its 7229 million shares representing 326 per cent interest in renong bought by uem
cimb added that having complied with the requirements of practice note 14 pn14 of the malaysian code on takeovers and mergers 1987 halim has been granted a waiver by the securities commission sc on january 9 1998 from the obligation to extend a mandatory general offer upon exercise of the put option subject to two other conditions
the first is that there should be no change in the existing structure and members of the group controlling renong at the time when the put option is exercised by uem
the second is that upon exercise of the put option halim's aggregate voting rights in renong inclusive of the option shares must not exceed 50 per cent
the sc had earlier required that uem convene an extraordinary general meeting by january 10 1998 to consider the acquisition of the renong shares
however cimb said that the sc has approved uem's application to extend the deadline to february 14 1998
it was first announced on november 17 1998 that uem had acquired 7229 million 50-sen shares or 326 per cent of renong's paid-up capital as at november 5 1997 for a total of rm2339 billion cash or at an average of rm324 per share
the fic had on october 24 1997 granted a waiver to uem and concert parties from making a general offer for renong shares on the grounds of national interest
on november 24 1997 cimb said it was reported in the press that the government had withdrawn the waiver given to uem in view of non-compliance with one of the conditions for the waiver
in granting the waiver given under rule 342 of the takeover code the fic imposed three conditions for the waiver one of which was stated in paragraph 23 of its letter dated october 24 1997 in bahasa malaysia
perolehan ini dihadkan kepada tidak lebih daripada 50 per cent hak mengundi dalam renong
cimb said that uem understood the condition to mean that it and the parties acting in concert with it were entitled to acquire a further 50 per cent of the shares in renong and the then existing shareholdings of the parties were not to be taken into account
however according to cimb the fic took the view that the 50 per cent should include the then existing shareholding of concert parties namely time engineering bhd and halim
having acted in good faith in effecting the 326 per cent acquisition on the basis of its uem's interpretation of the said condition and being of the opinion that the condition applied only to the shareholding of uem uem sought clarification from the authorities on the matter cimb added
halim currently has a 232 per cent equity interest in renong and upon exercise of the put option and assuming that none of the existing renong shares held by halim have been disposed of halim's equity interest in renong would increase to 558 per cent
accordingly under rule 341 of the takeover code halim would then be obliged to undertake a mandatory general offer for the remaining renong shares that he does not own
in view of the waiver granted by the fic and based on discussions with the sc halim had applied to the sc under pn14 of the takeover code for a waiver from the general offer
under pn14 in its consideration whether or not to grant a waiver to a person from a general offer the sc will take into account the following whether the leader of the group acting in concert or the largest individual shareholding had changed and whether the balance between the shareholdings in the group acting in concert has changed significantly
the price paid for the voting rights acquired
the relationship between the persons acting in concert and how long they had been acting in concert
with the acquisition of the renong shares halim uem and time would hold 232 per cent 326 per cent and 21 per cent respectively in renong
time and uem are associated companies of renong and therefore are parties acting in concert with halim who is considered the leader of the group acting in concert

its founder and director datuk abdul latiff mirasa said the financial aid was part of the venture capital company's newly-set up rm1 million fund to help smis survive the hard times

madness is the word to describe the situation on roads motorists had to take following the closure of the motorola interchange and parts of jalan pjs 8/1 to traffic since dec 31
of course the word chaos also comes to mind
the fumes were not only from the vehicles on the road if one had a closer look one could be sure it was from inside them and nobody would blame the motorists for being fuming mad
road closures seem to be almost everywhere in the klang valley
certainly motorists are used to them because they have accepted these closures as necessary for road-widening highway projects and the lrt
road diversions are often the result of road closures and these motorists must be given credit for tolerating mainly because the diversions are inevitable and also highway concessionaires usually make them in a way that causes the least inconvenience to motorists
but the motorola interchange closure is something else it is causing traffic havoc in three housing estates
the concessionaire lingkaran trans kota sdn bhd or litrak which has been criticised for closing the interchange has maintained that it was necessary to shorten the lebuhraya damansara-puchong construction period so that the public will not be further inconvenienced
meanwhile folks suffer until july when the closure is lifted and obviously many are not about to do so in silence
subang jaya state assemblyman lee hwa beng has received many e-mail messages letters and phone calls from very angry residents and motorists
and lee himself agrees with motorists that the closure is a bad move
well it is a bad move if the present situation is anything to go by
indeed the petaling jaya municipal council should step in to review the situation and decide on whether to lift the closure
there are also not enough directional signages to help motorists follow the diversions smoothly
litrak should put up more signboards to make it that bit easier for motorists it is obligated to do so
and while at that litrak should also take measures to improve the road conditions
perhaps the fumes will be a lot less the next time
nice things they say usually come in small packages good news
well they can come in any which way
that was how it was for subang jaya and usj residents it did not matter at all how the news about taman subang ria came on wednesday what was important was that the news was good
on wednesday the selangor state executive council rejected the application by sime-uep to develop a commercial project on the land
and sime-uep which was given the land by the state government in 1988 was also asked to return it to be administered by the subang jaya municipal council
this could not have come at a better time and could not have been more surprising given that all this while it seemed almost certain that sime-uep would still develop the area even for recreation purposes
and earlier as residents were crying foul about the proposed development of the only green lung available in their congested housing estate nobody who was somebody had come forward to set the record straight
selangor menteri besar datuk abu hassan omar announced this piece of good news after the state executive council meeting
he said any proposal or application to develop green lungs and open spaces in housing estates and areas gazetted as recreational areas would be rejected
this is actually the state's policy protecting existing green areas
tough policy but so many questions come to mind - how such a policy on greenery could be allowed to be so violated in selangor and whether after this the selangor government under datuk abu hassan omar would ensure that the policy will be adhered to
petaling jaya residents now want a green list happy and relieved to have found a green ally in abu hassan the residents now want to know the areas that have been gazetted for recreational purposes
a pj resident mack affandi of ss2 said he was happy with the menteri besar's announcement but expressed the hope that the petaling jaya municipal council would be allowed to effectively check any development in these areas
he is probably echoing the sentiments of most residents in pj subang jaya and usj in particular

kuala lumpur sun - almost a year after the cabinet fixed a temporary rate for using the country's first integrated scheduled waste treatment plant the project proponent and its clients have not agreed on a permanent fee structure
the temporary rate imposed by the cabinet last feb 26 was supposed to be up for review last month
it is learnt that work on the rm318 million plant at bukit nanas negri sembilan is on schedule and that it will be fully operational by the middle of this year
science technology and environment minister datuk law hieng ding said in an interview the fee structure had to be worked out because the proponent kualiti alam sdn bhd had not got data such as the amount and type of waste from the industries
the industries have not been forthcoming with the information he said
law said at a dialogue organised by the department of environment last sept 30 an understanding was reached for industries to provide the data to kualiti alam
they were represented by the federation of malaysian manufacturers and the malaysian international chamber of commerce and industry
so far the response has not been good the industries keep complaining that the rates proposed by kualiti alam are too high
kualiti alam has agreed to review them but it cannot if industries do not provide information
on feb 26 the cabinet directed kualiti alam to reduce its proposed fees by 10 per cent it was an interim measure to enable the two parties to work out a permanent fee structure the cabinet decided on a reviewafter december
this came after law submitted a proposal on the fees to be charged when the two parties failed to agree on a schedule
kualiti alam and the industries have been talking for years without making significant headway
fmm and micci's main complaint is that the rates proposed are too high
kualiti alam feels they are reasonable considering the investment
kualiti alam based its original fees on capital investment running and maintenance costs and estimated waste volume
during the last meeting it agreed to work out another schedule if the industries co-operated
it asked the industries to provide information about the type and amount of waste generated this would give an estimate of waste it could expect and make it easier to work out the rates
law said the industries had agreed to co-operate but it had not happened
asked what the ministry would do next law said the ball is now in the industries' court
it is learnt that more than 300 companies have signed on for kualiti alam's facility
more than 60 are sending waste for direct landfill and solidification
its other facilities such as the treatment plant for inorganic wastes and incinerator for organic wastes will be ready in one to three months
doe director-general tan meng leng said it would be better if industries provided the data for a review by kualiti alam
the data is to justify the review otherwise the industries will suffer in the long run prolonging the matter will not help
the minister said clearly that the government would review the rates after a year now it is up to the industries to assist in the matter he said
tan said kualiti alam had already disclosed everything when explaining how it came up with its proposed rates
in a letter faxed to the new straits times on oct 7 micci's president datuk jorgen bornhoft said it was not the organisation's function to determine the amount of waste kualiti alam could expect from its customers
the micci's functions were to promote protect and advance free enterprise and investment in the country and to liaise with the various government agencies on matters of concern to its members
it did not include guaranteeing that a certain amount of waste would be sent to the plant
bornhoft was responding to an article which appeared in the nst on oct 1 which among others stated that kualiti alam could take another look at its cost and work out the fee schedule again if fmm and micci could guarantee a certain amount of waste to be sent to the plant

petaling jaya sun - parti rakyat malaysia today proposed several steps to reduce food prices so that low- and middle-income earners can afford them
its president dr syed husin ali said those within the middle and lower income brackets would be the most badly affected if prices of goods continued to increase
this he said was because the value of their income had reduced due to the depreciation of the ringgit speaking to reporters outside the wet market in petaling jaya old town syed husin said prm's proposals included reducing exports of produce like fish vegetables and fruits and encouraging sales within the country through the co-operative system supervising major companies which have a monopoly over the production and marketing of certain essential food to avoid price manipulation enforcing price controls efficiently to ensure that prices of controlled items do not rise reviewing the policy and implementation of privatisation to maintain present tariffs or tolls for essential services and to prevent further increases formulating a new national agriculture policy to increase agricultural produce reduce food imports and guarantee food security and establishing a price tribunal to investigate and evaluate applications to increase prices and to make recommendations to the government

they're everywhere you wish there weren't so many of them scooting around at breakneck speeds you think they're dangerous zipping in and out between rows of stationary cars you hate them tough luck
in today's emerging economies the third surety of life after death and taxes is the maddening presence of cubchai underbone bikes
like bees to honey you will find them anywhere you encounter a traffic jam like the similarly reviled cockroach the underbone will survive nuclear war they are thriving and they're here to stay
car drivers yes you take note never underestimate the longevity of these screaming maniacal mosquitoes you would give an arm to be able to swat the underbone motorcycle cubchai nyamuk and other unkind names developed to its present monstrosity out of the humble moped or motorised pedal
like frankenstein the moped was born out of seemingly harmless intentions mainly developed as an affordable means of transportation for the masses after world war two the moped and its variations proved so successful that it has now become a symbol of rising world economies
it would have been nice and nostalgic had it stopped there instead the development of the moped went on unabated like an irritating relative who comes to visit and does not want to go home
the moped evolved in a mutated tandem of engine chassis and computerised design advancements to become the collective godzilla of traffic-jam beaters we are now only too familiar with
latest in line is the suzuki fx125 cyber sports touted as probably the most technologically-advanced underbone motorcycle in production today
and lest any of you car drivers out there begin to snicker in contempt at this claim consider what the fx125 has to offer a 125cc four-stroke single cylinder engine with four direct acting valves and oil cooling double overhead camshafts dohc a four-way adjustable rear monoshock enkei cast-aluminium wheels and a stomping 16ps of power coming from a mere 104kg of motorcycle a mouthful but this thing is fast nonetheless
this bike has very high top speed says y higashi suzuki japan's chief representative to malaysia with a gleam in his eye which only those in the know can understand
outright speed however is not what the fx125 is all about underbones are able to leave other vehicles in its wake due to its demonic power to weight ratio it weighs close to nothing but its motor though tiny is capable of stonking power you never thought possible
with a computerised chassis design and front wheels stopped by a massive disc brake you not only get demonic speed but the handling and braking capabilities to ensure you don't get to become the subject of an infocommercial on road safety
and apart from being dirt cheap at just over rm6000 this thing is clean forget the plumes of thick white smoke normally associated with two-stroke engines because the fx125 incorporates the latest clean burn technologies
its four-stroke powerplant is environmentally friendly and because the probability of this thing thing getting stuck in a traffic jam is only slightly better than winning the lottery it's efficient as well - you'll never get stuck motionless while your engine burns wasted fuel producing wasteful smoke emissions which you are also inhaling strapped to a chair listening to semi-literate radio deejays asking you to be patient on the road as they play the same songs over and over and er you get my drift
astride the fx125 with the wind in your face you are guaranteed your fair share of fresh air well what's left of it aside from those maddening minibuses and lori hantu which never fail to have their exhaust pipes pointed right at a motorcyclist's face a good time aboard the fx125 is guaranteed a hypothesis fully tested by yours truly
as any veteran ops nyamuk traffic policeman will tell you good car drivers go to heaven but those irritating mosquito underbones have the most fun underbones they're everywhere so get used to it because if you can't beat them why not join them so what are you waiting for
are you going to buy me one or not
defense minister gojko susak who last week underwent emergency surgery said monday he felt fine after undergoing appendix and ulcer surgery
i had an appendix surgery but at the operation table they discovered i had an ulcer too so they operated that as well susak told the associated press thanks god the operation went well and i feel fine
he said his planned to visit washington as scheduled to meet with us defense secretary roger cohen on jan 30
a statement issued by susak's office last week said only that he was rushed to a hospital after experiencing sudden pains in his appendix area
susak 53 has been the closest ally of president franjo tudjman since he became defense minister in 1991
in 1995 he was treated for lung cancer at the walter reed clinic in washington and said then the treatment was successful but last august he underwent more surgery at massachusetts general hospital in boston
he has since reduced his public activities
tudjman himself was admitted to walter reed in november 1996 for what us officials said was stomach cancer which he denied his health has apparently improved
susak originally from the croat-controlled south-western bosnia is considered a hard-line nationalist who favors close ties between bosnian croats and croatia he also has been crucial in persuading bosnian croats to abide with the dayton peace agreement for bosnia

i think the biggest challenge is to keep up with the times frechette 51 told reporters i think there's a great challenge for the united nations in defining its role in the future
frechette who speaks english french and spanish said there was a crying need for greater attention to economic and social development issues and to help define the proper role for the united nations on these kind of issues
frechette said the united nations must also re-examine its role in international peacekeeping operations - the high profile missions which have
fallen out of favor in washington and some other capitals after disastrous performances in somalia bosnia and rwanda
annan recommended creation of the new deputy post as part of a package of
reforms to address concerns of the united states and other member states about inefficiency within the un system

bangi sun - university students should not worry about getting jobs upon their graduation as several sectors are still charting growth under the present economic situation
panellists at a forum on the economic problems and its implications on public universities today assured undergraduates that ample job opportunities exist in the electronic information technology education and tourism sectors
graduates however could not afford to be choosy
director of universiti kebangsaan malaysia's institute of malaysia and international studies professor dr ishak shari said graduates could also venture out on their own
they can choose not to be employees and instead use their brains and know-how to start something of their own
ishak was answering questions from undergraduates who were worried about the availability of jobs in view of the economic problems
the forum organised by ukm's treasury and undergraduates' association was attended by about 200 ukm lecturers staff and undergraduates
ukm deputy vice-chancellor student affairs professor datuk dr wan hashim wan teh opened the forum aimed at keeping participants abreast of developments in the national economic scene
ishak however said generally jobs would not be as easily available as before
graduates who hope to indulge in job-hopping will be disappointed
another panellist dr ismail muhammad salleh said graduates should not have the perception that the situation was entirely bleak
it is a matter of how you utilise your resources there are still areas with potential graduates can also utilise this time to pursue postgraduate studies
ismail is former deputy director of the institute of strategic and international studies and former member of the national economic advisory panel

iraq announced monday it would block any arms inspections by a team led by american scott ritter a move that could set off a new confrontation with un weapons inspectors
the official iraqi news agency made the announcement quoting an official spokesman who said the presence of too many american inspectors was prolonging the inspections program and delaying removal of un sanctions on iraq
the agency's statement came after ritter and a team of un inspectors reportedly visited a hospital and a prison in baghdad
apparently the team was not blocked since the agency's report said the ban on ritter would begin jan 13 tuesday
iraq has repeatedly criticized ritter accusing him of spying for the cia
ritter a former marine major who has been an inspector for six years has dismissed the charge as absolutely untrue
ritter was heavily involved in the inspections of sensitive sites that led to last october's standoff between iraq and the weapons inspectors
the government spokesman said monday that ritter's team included too many americans and britons he said it would not be allowed to continue until it was reformed in a balanced manner
the official who was not identified by the agency said the team included nine americans five britons a russian and an australian
this shows striking evidence of the imbalance in the composition of the team and its methods of action in iraq the spokesman said
in new york un secretary-general kofi annan said no decision has been taken to halt inspections in the wake of iraq's statement on ritter he noted that the chief weapons inspector richard butler was to travel to baghdad for talks jan 19
butler is due to talk to the iraqi authorities about their barring the un teams from some 60 sites including about 40 presidential palaces on grounds of national sovereignty
i hope that the iraqi authorities will not do anything precipitous and will wait for mr butler to get there to raise whatever issues they have with him annan told reporters
iraq's un ambassador nizar hamdoon said iraq considered such a large percentage of british and americans on the ritter team to be unacceptable
iraq has insisted that the work of the special commission especially on the inspection side should be more balanced in composition hamdoon said therefore iraq is not going to accept this heavily influenced team by the american and british nationals
the other un inspection teams in iraq would be allowed to continue their work hamdoon said
the us ambassador to the un bill richardson reminded reporters that the security council meets tuesday
iraq is up to its old tricks richardson said in palm beach fla we feel the security council should make a strong response
the white house issued a similar reaction spokesman mike mccurry said the world had heard provocative statements from the government of iraq on the constitution of un inspection teams over and over again they have been met with the same resolved response of the international community
in baghdad the iraqi spokesman also accused american arms inspectors of carrying out activities detrimental to iraq's national interest
they have been falsifying facts inventing lies deliberately prolonging the process and sending false reports to the security council the agency quoted him as saying
during last fall's confrontation iraq accused american inspectors of spying on iraq and helping plan for us air strikes un officials denied the charges and pulled all weapons inspectors out of the country the impasse was ended with russian mediation
the inspectors' job is to certify that iraq has fulfilled its obligation under un resolutions to eliminate its weapons of mass destruction
sanctions imposed on iraq following its 1990 invasion of neighboring kuwait _ which include a ban on the export of oil _ cannot be lifted until the un security council accepts that iraqi weapons programs have been halted
iraq maintains it has fulfilled the requirements under security council resolutions but the weapons inspectors have repeatedly accused the government of president saddam hussein of hiding weapons and the means to manufacture them lb-ggl/jbm

the merger of malaysia's finance companies will allow them to expand overseas besides being more productive and efficient says chief executive officer of credit corp m bhd ccm mohd hanif sher mohd
by being big players we are not looking at the malaysian market alone the world should be our market said hanif in an interview with business times yesterday
established in 1963 ccm itself was an associate company of australia guarantee corp ltd until as recently as 1994
ccm and eon finance bhd - both finance companies under the drb-hicom group - are but two of malaysia's 39 companies that are to merge into a core finance company following bank negara's initiative to have only a few core companies by march 31
for watchers of the industry the mergers signal that the industry is gearing up for the challenges of the next millennium placing them on a stronger footing and preparing them for more competition liberalisation and globalisation
hanif said the finance industry should now be viewed as big market players similar if not at par with the banks playing a significant role in the economic development of the country
while hire-purchase and housing loans will continue to be an important part of the business hanif said the industry will probably branch out into the manufacturing sector
with fewer finance companies hanif says there will be keener competition to provide customers with better service
now it will be a competition among the big boys and they will all be trying to come up with something new to benefit the customers
the core companies he said will also be able to withstand the competition from foreign ones as the financial services market begins to liberalise because of customer loyalty to malaysian companies who have strong networks and in-depth knowledge of the local conditions
he also feels that it is unfair for foreigners to view malaysia's finance companies in the same light as others in the region as malaysian companies are tightly regulated and much better capitalised
meanwhile consumers can expect the traditional role of finance companies to change and become more responsive to customer needs with reduced response times new services and specialised marketing and products teams
it will definitely be better for customers hanif said
however the impact of the mergers he said will be seen later this year with the new ccm-eon entity emerging as an energised entity that will be more focused and that will allow it to even specialise
following the merger between eon finance and ccm the new entity will become a tier-one company in terms of capital with a higher ranking in terms of assets at present ccm is ranked 6th in terms of asset size
ccm alone has an issued and paid-up capital of rm291 million and 25 branches and the merger with eon will give the new entity 63 branches throughout the country
that does not include the potential of the companies the drb-hicom group is in discussion with abrar finance bhd chempaka finance bhd city finance bhd kewangan bersatu bhd and not kewangan utama bhd as mentioned before and kewangan industries bhd
for hanif larger finance companies will not mean colder impersonal treatment but better service with more facilities such as more branches and atms and a better selection of products
the larger we are the more friendly we are going to be

teluk intan sun - essential items such as sugar condensed milk flour onions and cooking oil will be available in padiberas nasional and federal agriculture marketing authority shops from next week
domestic trade and consumer affairs minister datuk seri megat junid megat ayob said the move was to ensure sufficient supply of these items during the double festive season
he said the items would be sold at the 200 bernas and the 160 fama outlets nationwide
he said sugar manufacturers and distributors of essential items had been directed to supply the items to bernas and fama as soon as possible
he said bernas and fama had been advised not to hike the prices of the items but to fix reasonable prices and to ensure that supply was adequate
megat junid said this after breaking fast at the kampung tukang sidin mosque in sungai manik yesterday
consumers are assured that there will be adequate supply of all essential items including sugar
he however said consumers would still not be allowed to buy more than stipulated
the minister recently said in the border states the sale of essential items such as sugar and flour would be restricted to between 2kg and 3kg a person and in places where there was no risk of smuggling 5kg a person
to ensure sufficient supply at the outlets megat junid said the ministry's enforcement divisions in each state had been directed to monitor the situation closely and to check on hoarding regularly
the ministry he said had also set up a bomba scheme to ensure that there was no artificial shortage of any of the items
megat junid likened the scheme to the fire services and rescue department's strategy of getting to the root of the problem immediately after receiving a call
he said consumers could lodge reports directly with the ministry if they felt that the items were not sufficient in their areas and the ministry would deploy enforcement officers to check on the situation
if the report is true supply would immediately be replenished in the said areas
megat junid said these were among the steps taken to assure consumers that there would be sufficient supply during the festive season
he said the measures would be carried out until the festive season was over
megat junid said fama would also be opening 160 pasar tani on jan 27 and 29 to ensure consumers obtained their essential goods as many shops would be closed during this period
on reports of sugar shortage he said it was ironic that they only occurred in malay-dominated areas such as datuk keramat taman melawati kampung gajah and sungai manik
i have not heard complaints of sugar shortages in kepong selayang cheras or bukit bintang
is it because malays consume more sugar or is it because of the fasting month
he said a study would be done to ascertain this

malaysia's move to encourage the use of asian currencies in bilateral trade within the region was lauded as sensible and ideal by economists last week the move according to them would help stabilise the prices of goods
using asian currencies they said would minimise asia's dependence on the us dollar
the economists however still found it hard to imagine that importers and exporters in crisis-hit countries notably the association of south-east asian nations asean would accept the idea and put it into practice
an economist with a regional research firm pointed out that not only must malaysian traders be convinced about the viability of the plan their foreign counterparts must also follow suit
this may prove a bit difficult since regional importers and exporters have long depended on the us dollar as the settlement currency
it is not just a matter of announcing that malaysia has decided to trade with other asian countries using local currencies
implementation and suggestion are two different things of course i do not want to underestimate the potential success of the plan if it could really take off but malaysia must first iron out details of the plan to ensure it operates smoothly he said
another problem is that the situation could become more messy because an exporter will have to start monitoring the respective asean currencies if he is to trade with countries like singapore the philippines indonesia thailand and brunei
a senior economist with a local brokerage house said paying for imports from asian countries in their currencies is all very well for local importers because they are getting the goods at a much lower price
but it will be difficult convincing exporters to accept local currencies for something they now get double the value for their goods sold regionally as a result of the strengthening us dollar
what they gain on the import side they may lose on the export side
for that reason regional importers and exporters may be reluctant to embrace the change he added
in a telephone interview with business times dr mohamed aslam mohamed hanees head of the department of economics at the international islamic university said the issue is clearly not economic but political
therefore asian heads of government must first be made to establish commitments to ensure that the plan works malaysia has to persuade political leaders of asia to accept the idea of making payments in asian currencies when trading within the region he said
in fact he believes that deputy prime minister and finance minister datuk seri anwar ibrahim's recent call to local importers and exporters more than anything else was also a step to bring the issue to the attention of political leaders of neighbouring countries
last thursday anwar said he is confident the plan is viable in view of the success malaysia has achieved with the bilateral payments arrangement bpa and the palm oil credit payment arrangement the country had initiated with trading partners from the developing world
to date malaysia has signed the bpa with 30 countries including pakistan argentina chile iran fiji tunisia laos peru vietnam mexico myanmar zimbabwe botswana and mozambique
meanwhile mohamed aslam said it is easy to see why asian traders should hesitate over embracing malaysia's plan now when they are rapidly losing faith in their currencies as they continue to fall
economically there is enough evidence to suggest using of asian currencies in trade will help the region in the long run
but it may be a problem to see its results in the short term because asean currencies in particular are still fluctuating and people have already lost confidence in the market he said
mohamed aslam said to make the plan work the various asean governments could start by implementing the concept in their trade dealings
this will help instil some confidence among regional importers and exporters and it is just a matter of time before they would follow suit
however having the private sector to implement it first is quite unrealistic he said
mohamed aslam believes that it is very unlikely that malaysia will its plan materialise in the near term this is a long-term plan because it involves many parties
another crucial factor to ensure the plan operates smoothly is that the trade volume between the countries has to be big making up at least 20 per cent of a country's total foreign trade
malaysia and singapore is a good example which would substantiate the use of local currencies in their trade dealings he said
an economist with a us investment house said it is possible for the plan to work except that most of the asean currencies are not widely circulated today for one how prepared are regional banks in handling these kind of transactions
this all boils down to a concerted move the various heads of government will have to sit down and reach an agreement on the matter this would then have to be taken up by the regional banks importers and exporters
on the formation of a single asean currency economists felt that it is also a good idea because it will be more convenient for regional importers and exporters
nonetheless mohamed aslam believes the economic crisis could serve as a wake-up call for asean leaders the issue will now be seriously discussed
he added that perhaps non-governmental organisations and regional economists could sit down and help come up with a proposal
whether or not malaysia's call for the use of asian currencies in trade dealings as well as the formation of a single asean currency will be realised in the current year depends on the concerted effort among the asian governments
one thing for sure is economically countries in the region depend on each other malaysia's economic fate mostly depends on what happens within asean and not what happens in the country alone
so even if malaysia were to put its house in order today it will not help much because investors look at the region as a whole the big players in the market draw up expansion plans based on the region's growth economists said stressing that it must be a group effort
repairs on the mir's leaky exit hatch will be left for the space station's next team which received its final approval monday from russian space officials
the new crew _ russian cosmonauts talgat musabayev and nikolai budarin and french astronaut leopold eyharts _ is to go into space on jan 29 and dock with the mir a day later
a top priority will be fixing the leak from the exit hatch _ a problem diagnosed by the current crew but left unrepaired because of more pressing work
eyharts was originally scheduled to go to the mir last fall but his mission was postponed following the mir's june collision with a cargo ship that halved the station's power supply and russian officials said there was not enough electricity for eyharts' experiments
the current crew consisting of russians anatoly solovyov and pavel vinogradov and american david wolf has restored the station's power supply to nearly pre-crash level
although problems still remain aboard the 12-year-old orbiter eyharts was optimistic monday that they will not impede his scientific experiments
i think they are a part of the flight eyharts said i hope they will be few but i think we are ready to handle them
the new crew will also try to locate the holes in the station's spektr module caused by the cargo ship collision but russian space officials maintain that the problem is not a pressing one
the spektr was mostly an energy-producing module and the energy supply has been mostly restored said deputy head of the russian space agency boris ostroumov
but a spacewalk in november that repaired the energy supply led to a new problem _ the air leak from the exit hatch on the kvant-2 module
the hatch failed to close properly after the spacewalk resulting in a partial loss of pressure in the module last friday solovyov and vinogradov discovered during another venture into open space that one of the 10 main locks on the hatch door was broken which prevented a tight seal
the leak was not considered dangerous because it only affects the kvant's docking chamber which is sealed from the rest of the station
still it has been inconvenient forcing the crew to don their bulky spacesuits in a smaller compartment nearby
the cosmonauts attempted to lock the chamber tightly by using the hatch's 10 auxiliary locks
but pressure has dropped by 100 millimeters to the level of 560 millimeters since the latest spacewalk according to russia's mission control deputy chief viktor blagov
the next crew plans to venture into open space at least six times for repair and maintenance work the number of spacewalks may rise to eight if repairs take longer at least three of the spacewalks will focus on replacing a jet located on the outside of the station
the mir's current crew also still has another spacewalk ahead of them solovyov and wolf plan to venture into open space wednesday night to collect some us scientific experiments attached to the mir's outer hull
the 12-year-old mir which was expected to last only five years has been relatively quiet recently after a string of accidents last year
vowing revenge for the slaughter of 30 praying muslims thousands of shiite muslims smashed cars set fire to buildings and tried to storm parliament on monday
police set up steel barricades and used tear gas to stem the religious violence
black smoke billowed skyward as workers fled burning buildings for the acrid air outside where rioters burned tires and pelted police with stones mourners wailed and beat their chests over enshrouded corpses victims of sunday's massacre of worshipers kneeling at a lahore cemetery
warriors of jhangvi a secretive sunni muslim group named for a militant killed years ago claimed responsibility for the massacre and warned of further attacks on pakistan's minority shiite muslim community
we will not spare shiites in pakistan said the message delivered to news outlets
witnesses said at least 15 people were injured in the unrest monday
hundreds of police surrounded by steel barricades and armored vehicles stopped a mob was trying to move toward the punjab provincial parliament
unable to reach the legislative buildings the mob set fire to the sprawling brick provincial courthouse built before the subcontinent gained its independence from britain in 1947
dozens of young shiite muslims bared their chests and dared police to fire we're not afraid kill us they screamed from today we will fight we will not spare anyone who kills our brothers
they vowed revenge and asked for prime minister nawaz sharif before setting fire to cars and buildings
almost 300 people died in religiously motivated attacks in pakistan last year most of the killings occurred in the punjab province home to 60 percent of pakistan's 140 million people most of whom are sunni muslims
all the shops in lahore a city of 9 million people were shuttered monday out of fear of shiite retaliation and in respect for the dead
in the federal capital of islamabad sharif and his cabinet met to devise a strategy to curb the rising sectarian violence
lawmakers condemned the killing of innocent people in the strongest terms and vowed to bring the culprits to book said information minister mushahid hussein
sunday's attack began as prayer leader allama aktar abbas najvi paused to offer a warning we must be very cautious he said we are not safe here in pakistan
moments later two gunmen on a motorcycle roared up to the service and turned their rifles on the mourners killing 24 people and injuring more than 30 another four people died of their wounds on monday
five rwandan roman catholic nuns were killed last week in their diocese the vatican newspaper l'osservatore romano said monday
the newspaper citing the missionary service news agency said the circumstances of the slayings in busasamana thursday were unclear two other sisters were wounded and in serious condition vatican radio said
the nuns were ethnic hutus and belonged to the sisters of the resurrection order l'osservatore said the order was founded in 1966 in what was then zaire
violence has been on the upswing lately in rwanda where the tutsi-dominated government and military has been fighting hutu rebels government forces defeated hutu soldiers and militiamen responsible for the 1994 slaughter of more than 500000 tutsis who are in the minority
numerous roman catholic religious figures including bishops priests and missionaries have died in rwanda burundi and zaire in recent years
the united states wants to develop a more active military presence in southeast asia and will not accept constraints on its ships' movements as some in the region want defense secretary william cohen said monday
we want total flexibility cohen told reporters traveling with him on a 12-day seven-nation tour of east asia that began in malaysia on sunday and will take him tuesday to indonesia amid speculation about political turmoil in that country
at a news conference cohen discounted suggestions that indonesia's economic crisis could lead to ethnic unrest and political upheaval
it is important for indonesia to act quickly and to try to reform its economic structures as closely as possible to the imf recommendations cohen said referring to the international monetary fund's prescriptions for reform that are a central feature of a dlrs 40 billion international bailout for indonesia
the situation in indonesia is particularly troublesome in the us view because of questions about the durability of president suharto's regime he has ruled for more than three decades but his current term ends in march a leading opposition figure citing the economic turmoil this week called for him to step down
cohen used a public conference in malaysia to offer reassurances of us support
such times of tumult should give greater impetus to broadening and deepening defense cooperation between our countries cohen told the conference held at the ornate palace of the golden horses a new luxury hotel and conference center on the outskirts of kuala lumpur that seemed to symbolize the kind of extravagance that has contributed to east asia's financial pinch
later at a news conference cohen said the united states wants to arrange joint military exercises and make deals for us ship access to ports in the region as part of an american strategy to broaden its military presence in the pacific
he cautioned however that southeast asian nations should not expect the united states to accept limitations on the movement of its naval and other forces in the area some governments which cohen refused to identify have suggested confidence-building measures such as requiring an early notification of the movement of us naval forces in the region and limits on their size
cohen said this would amount to unacceptable shackles on us military planning that could present a major problem in times of sudden military trouble
i'd like to be very clear in stating that the united states will not support initiatives that would either undermine our operational flexibility or constrain our military posture cohen said
the value of our military presence to regional stability depends upon our operational flexibility he said
following cohen at the public conference called the pacific dialogue was henry kissinger the former secretary of state as reporters were being led from the room at the start of kissinger's remarks he could be heard expressing support for cohen's statement that america must remain engaged in asia
we have to stand with this region in this dramatic period kissinger said
the first heavy snowstorm in six years blanketed jerusalem on monday closing schools stranding motorists and drawing families outside to show children snow for the first time

in jerusalem most schools and businesses were closed the army canceled field exercises and israel radio offered tips to drivers unaccustomed to snowy roads
because the city doesn't have snowplows workers used bulldozers and earth movers to clear the roads
an announcer on israel's channel 1 tv gleefully held up a handful of snow to show viewers the real thing
in the streets people picked their way around snowdrifts cameras in hand snowball fights broke out some tourists built a snowman in the shadow of jerusalem's western wall judaism's holiest site

primary industries minister datuk seri dr lim keng yaik has called for a joint effort between exporters in malaysia thailand and indonesia to help stem the drop in rubber prices
the price of rss i rubber had dropped to 62 us cents per kg the lowest in the history of natural rubber he told reporters after officiating a function at the persatuan chin tai kok yesterday
compared to 1973 and 1974 when rubber prices dropped to 89 us cents per kg he said the current price was ridiculous
lim said this was puzzling as there was enough demand for natural rubber in the international markets
we are not getting any benefits out of the weakening of the ringgit as compared to the us dollar
he said exporters must communicate and co-ordinate efforts to get a fair price
lim slammed western consumer countries for bullying malaysia by fixing an unfair price for rubber
he said palm oil price has risen from rm1200 us$480 in july to rm2600 per tonne on friday following the strengthening of the us dollar
this means the price has doubled following the currency exchange rate movement and the market demand which is a fair price it shows that if we are able to co-operate we can get a fair price like for palm oil he said
in a tit-for-tat move macedonian authorities revoked border visas for greeks on monday further hampering the flow of goods and traffic between the two balkan states
this latest move by the skopje authorities forces all greeks wishing to cross into neighboring macedonia to first apply for a visa in athens more than 500 kilometers 310 miles south of the border
the measure is seen as an unwilling reciprocity after diplomatic negotiations over the past two months failed to establish a flexible border regimen
since november macedonian citizens applying for a visa for greece can do so only in the former's skopje liaison office
the trade exchange between greece and macedonia grossed a total of dlrs 180 million in 1996 and has been on the rise since
the two states have been involved in a six-year dispute over macedonia's name dating back to the breakup of former yugoslavia of which macedonia was a part
greece claims macedonia is the name of its northern province and not the former yugoslav republic

telecommunications giants telekom malaysia bhd and binariang sdn bhd are rumoured to be considering a merger speculation is also rife that technology resources industries bhd may merge its cash-rich cellular communications network m sdn bhd with time telecommunications sdn bhd
an industry source said such rumours surfaced after additional economic measures were recently announced by deputy prime minister datuk seri anwar
among the measures announced in parliament was the clampdown on approvals for new listings and corporate exercises - which effectively curtailed some possible fund-raising avenues
the only other option seems to be the entry of foreign equity holders which time telecom is still mulling while us west's 18 per cent stake in binariang leaves room for another to take up the other 12 per cent foreign stake
but foreigners are still wary and listing plans for binariang and time telecom seems to have gone awry - at least for now
with the government urging the private sector to curtail imports so as to reduce outflow of foreign currency mergers were seen by many as being the only viable option left for newer operators to expand their networks
the source quipped that economic forces ultimately were far more persuasive than the government was in 1995 in wanting to see fewer telephony players
he said talks leading up to these possible mergers might start early this year
should these two mergers come to pass only mutiara swisscom bhd will be left as the other significant player
mobile telephony operator mobikom sdn bhd is still seen as an adjuncant of telekom malaysia despite hicom holdings bhd 30 per cent sapura holdings bhd 30 per cent and permodalan nasional bhd 10 per cent being the other shareholders
telekom malaysia bhd chief executive datuk mohamed said mohamed ali has said mobikom's future is closely tied to the telecommunications giant - and will exercise its rights as a shareholder to ensure this is so
this leaves only sistem telefon wireless sdn bhd and citifon sdn bhd as niche players with their respective wireless and payphone services
otherwise 1997 has been relatively quiet for the telephony industry except for the tariff rebalancing exercise which was asked to be reconsidered
about the only operator which made waves was telekom malaysia which acquired strategic stakes in thailand and south africa
with us-based telecommunications firm sbc communication in a joint-venture company called thintana communications telekom malaysia acquired a 30 per cent equity in telkom south africa in april
the group effectively owns a 12 per cent share while sbc communications holds the remaining 18 per cent
telekom malaysia's share in the venture which is said to be the single largest foreign direct investment in south africa to date and the start of the implementation of the government's restructuring programme for state-owned enterprises is valued at us$5044 million rm2376 million
closer to home telekom malaysia has recently bought an initial 201 per cent in thailand's samart corp which will be its springboard to gain access to cambodia via samart's cellular phone services there
operations-wise the main stategy of the telephony firms have been to sign up with property developers to design and lay the telecommunications infrastructure as the project is being developed
this being a long-term business is not expected to be adversely affected by the property slowdown and project deferments in 1998
cellular phone companies offered roaming services to more countries while mutiara swisscom took this one step further with its swiss partner swisscom to offer multiple roaming services with just one agreement signed
the agreement signed with an international firm comfone ltd allowed mutiara swisscom to be malaysia's first mobile operator to provide international roaming services to gsm-based mobile operators worldwide
the pact specifically provides the ability to interconnect gsm 900 gsm 1800 better known in malaysia as pcn and gsm 1900 networks to each other without the need to set up bilateral agreements with every individual network operator linked only to a single international roaming platform
the irp facility jointly developed by swisscom and uk-based vodafone group ltd enables network operators to access various networks with a single roaming agreement with comfone ltd
also as in 1995 when it became one of the first new cellular services to take off mutiara swisscom once again stole some thunder away from other telecommunications firms by announcing and then proceeding with its listing exercise
however the listing exercise suffered due to poor investors' sentiment with the share offer being undersubscribed and later the shares were traded below the offer price
with shares priced at rm550 each the initial public offer saw one of the lowest subscription rate of only 425 per cent or 5077 applicants for the 50 million units made available
and this was despite the lure of free mobile telephones for every applicant the subsequent traded share price was equally weak falling by almost rm2 on listing day
but despite this setback mutiara swisscom was in well enough a financial position for it had already secured bank loans way before and also bought the bulk of its equipment in april when the contract's exchange rate was pegged at rm262 against the us dollar
this has put mutiara swisscom at a very comfortable level as its existing network infrastructure can already cater for about 400000 users while its existing subscriber base has just passed the 160000 mark
the subscriber base translates to a healthy operational cashflow and the telecommunications company also enjoys strong support from 30 per cent stakeholder swisscom of switzerland
this is an enviable position which binariang and time telecom are said to be finding it tough to emulate
for binariang and its associated two measat satellites with a planned third and satellite cable network astro the debt-heavy investments has led to the slashing of expatriate staff as part of cost-cutting measures
some local staff are also affected with total layoffs projected to finally reach 1500 in all
while it already has loans to back its capital expenditure the mounting interest is eating into the profits of all its earnings - especially that of its maxis cellular service which now boasts of over 200000 subscribers
time telecom has also taken steps to freeze wage increases and cut costs and recent speculation was that it might be bought over by telekom malaysia - which has since died out after some confusing statements
still there is no denying that time telecom is up for sale - given the recent controversy about united engineers malaysia bhd buying into its parent renong bhd in what some still do not consider to be a valid share buyback scheme
the on-going economic problems have also added to the cash crunch and even mobikom was not spared with speculation of its stake changing hands
but one thing is clear should the two giant mergers come to pass mohamed said's vision of transforming telekom malaysia into a full multi-media and communications company will be realised
after all it was rumoured to be buying into sistem television malaysia bhd tv3 to obtain the content that would help it to become a multimedia content provider since tv3 apart from broadcasting also produces much of its own programmes and runs cable network megatv
as such the merger with binariang and its associates will allow telekom malaysia to offer not only full multimedia services but also optimise its operations with the nation's two satellites
as for the celcom-time merger the result would be almost the same as it would allow tri to be an almost complete telecommunications provider including payphones and obtain its much-wanted third cellular licence
time telecom operates the adam pcn system and also owns the uniphone network apart from running its own fibre optic trunk services
having kept a relatively low profile since the success of its art900 service celcom is now set to scale new heights with its fixed-line services
about the only issue still left unsettled is that of equal access where the customer is to be allowed to make trunk calls with any operator
the mechanism is still being worked out and all the operators are awaiting eagerly for the final draft so as to formulate plans to eat into telekom malaysia's long-held monopoly

states will only be allowed to pay a maximum of rm24000 each as signing- on fees to only three local players in another cost-cutting measure announced by the fa of malaysia fam yesterday
even then only players in demand and of a certain status can receive the fee fam competitions committee chairman datuk redzuan tan sri sheikh ahmad said after the 1998 m-league briefing to state representatives at wisma fam
fam who will take stern action against states who flout the ruling introduced the ruling after learning that several states had promised players much more than the ceiling salary of rm5000 per month and another rm3000 in bonuses and allowances
we have to curb the under-the-table' payments states cannot take us a for a ride like this all the representatives have agreed to the punishment if their states flout the rule he said
fam he added decided on the signing-on fee for local players because most of the top players would be earning much less than before owing to the salary ceiling capped at rm5000 per month and rm3000 in bonuses and allowances
the rm24000 is based on three times the maximum salary and allowances a player can receive per month this amount was also agreed upon by all the states yesterday
only players who have reached a certain status would be allowed to receive this payment the deal must be transparent and if anyone violates it the fas will be fined heavily while the teams officials and player will be suspended
the fine be to imposed for such a violation would be approximately rm100000 but the final amount would only be decided at fam's council meeting on feb 8
the team also face expulsion from the league while officials and players involved are likely to face lengthy bans
asked how fam are going to keep tabs on the matter redzuan said all payments must be accounted for and can be traced when accounts are submitted to the national body and income tax department
we will be checking all the accounts and if we find payments that are not accounted for we will hold a special enquiry to investigate the matter as soon as possible said redzuan
meanwhile fam also provided cost-cutting measures including having the reserve league matches on the same day see accompanying story
sometimes states spend unnecessarily when it comes to food lodging and travelling and a lot of money is wasted he said
with regard to the recent azman adnan signing controversy fam secretary-general datuk paul mony samuel said players can negotiate with any team as the rules allow them to do so while state fas are the ones to be blamed if a player does not keep his word
players are behaving like kings because fas are easily taken in by them fas must be careful when conducting deals ethically a player should keep his promise but we cannot do anything as it does not flout the rules said mony
a us official proposed that yasser arafat write a letter forswearing clauses in the plo charter that call for israel's destruction in order to alleviate israel's concerns on the issue an israeli cabinet minister said monday
the proposal was made last week by us envoy dennis ross said israeli industry minister natan sharansky but he said israel insists the offending clauses be formally repudiated in the palestinian legislature
the palestinian leader promised to cancel the clauses in september 1993 when israel and the plo signed a historic agreement and in may 1996 he pushed a decision through the palestinian legislature declaring the calls for israel's destruction were no longer in effect
israel's leader at the time shimon peres hailed that decision as one of the most important developments of the century but prime minister benjamin netanyahu who won elections a month later says it was insufficient because it did not specify the clauses
sharansky told israel tv that during his peace mission last week ross suggested arafat write a letter to netanyahu and president clinton specifying the clauses and saying that as of now they are cancelled
but even this would not be enough sharansky said another letter won't help a letter needs to be the beginning of a process that must lead to a vote in the palestinian council
sufian abu zaide arafat's adviser on relations with israel insisted the charter issue was taken care of if you say the 1996 decision was a show then if we have another show you will be satisfied he asked sharansky
some israeli commentators believe netanyahu _ who once opposed the accords with the plo and remains lukewarm about them _ was using the charter issue as a pretext
but sharansky insisted that this was not so and that fastidiousness was essential if it was so marginal it would have been done by the palestinians long ago he said dp
canada's deputy defense minister was named un deputy secretary-general monday fulfilling un chief kofi annan's pledge to appoint a woman to the second-highest post in the world organization
louise frechette served as canada's un ambassador from 1992 to 1994 and has been deputy defense minister since june 1995 she told reporters that she would bring expertise in managing large organizations
the general assembly created the deputy secretary-general post last month to help improve coordination and efficiency within the world-wide un system
i think the biggest challenge is to keep up with the times frechette 51 told reporters i think there's a great challenge for the united nations in defining its role in the future
she said there was a crying need for greater attention to economic and social development issues and to help define the proper role for the united nations on these kind of issues
frechette said the united nations must also re-examine its role in international peacekeeping operations - the high profile missions which have fallen out of favor in washington and some other capitals after disastrous performances in somalia bosnia and rwanda
annan recommended creation of the new deputy post as part of a package of reforms to address concerns of the united states and other member states about inefficiency within the un system
the job description of the deputy secretary-general is broad including assisting annan in managing un operations representing the secretary-general at conferences and official functions and undertaking assignments for the un chief
frechette was the third choice for the post former norwegian prime minister gro harlem brundtland and un refugee chief sadako ogata of japan were considered for the job but bowed out in part because of uncertainty over the duties
frechette said she would manage a small personal staff and work with annan's management team
a native of montreal frechette holds a doctorate from saint mary's university in halifax nova scotia and had held several senior diplomatic posts
she served as canada's ambassador to argentina and later as deputy foreign minister for latin america and the caribbean
three suspects appeared in court monday on murder charges in connection with a 10 million rand dlrs 2 million highway robbery in south africa that killed six security guards
the three suspects who were charged with murder attempted murder and robbery were among eight who have been arrested since the dec 17 robbery it was not clear whether the other five have been charged
the suspects include two policemen
the robbery near marble hall in the northeast was the bloodiest in a spate of robberies of cash transporters in south africa the security guards died when the robbers smashed a dump truck into the armored car and an escort vehicle
police recovered 100000 rand dlrs 20000 while arresting two suspects late last year
violent crime has become a major concern in south africa and has led some to call for restoration of the death penalty
under fire for their inability to stem crime and prevent repeated jailbreaks police are moving carefully to build their case
the head of the national special investigation team bushie engelbrecht refrained from arresting two men who wanted to confess to the robbery to avoid problems in the prosecution
police have to build up sufficient evidence against any suspect before taking him in he said

the fa of malaysia's proposal to stage reserve league matches a few hours before each saturday's league programme turned out to be a sore point at yesterday's m-league briefing at wisma fam
the fam felt the move would save costs but several states felt that playing two matches on the same day would only worsen ground conditions and severely affect m-league matches played after reserve league ties
fam competitions committee chairman datuk redzuan tan sri sheikh ahmad said they hoped the states would see it fam's way before a final decision is made at the council meeting on feb 8
the states have only one reason not to accept our proposal but they must understand that by following our guidelines it would save them thousands of ringgit said redzuan
furthermore their contention does not really make sense as most of our stadiums have very good pitches playing two matches a day is unlikely to harm the pitch nor the standard of the game
we hope they will understand our suggestion is only for their own good
the premier one league qualifying tournament will be held on a centralised basis on march 8-21 probably in kuala lumpur
six teams - johor penang kelantan terengganu malacca and the national pre-olympic team - will be drawn into two groups of three teams each with the top two advancing to another league tournament comprising the four sides
the top two teams will then play in premier one while the rest will play in premier two
the pre-olympic team will only be involved in the league tournaments either premier one or premier two they will not take part in the malaysia cup even if they qualify the next best team will replace them
the charity shield between selangor malaysia cup champions and sarawak premier league champions will be on march 28
fam will adopt a wait-and-see approach with regard to the sabah fa and their expulsion from the sabah sports council this is because the sabah fa cannot represent sabah once they have been removed from the council
sabah however can compete in fam-sanctioned tournaments under another name
each m-league team can register a total of 25 players for premier one teams states must sign on at least 12 local and three foreign pros
for premier two teams states need only sign a minimum of six local and three foreign pros
the penalty points system for yellow cards may not be used next season because of the fewer number of matches played this season fam may revert to the two-yellow card system where players will be suspended for a match after picking up two cautions

leaders of the main coalition party on monday urged a partner not to bolt the government and offered unspecified changes in reform efforts
disputes within the coalition government led by prime minister victor ciorbea are making it difficult for the country of 23 million people to start firmly on the path of privatization and market reforms
the democratic party which has six cabinet ministers meets in a national council on wednesday to decide whether it will stay in the government the democrats are frustrated with the pace of reform and angered that popular transport minister traian basescu was forced to resign for criticizing it
if they pull out the government would lose its majority in parliament
apparently trying to forestall a move by the democrats ciorbea said in a national tv address monday that he would find a new way to push reforms he was not specific
ion diaconescu president of the national peasants party of which ciorbea is a member made clear that he wanted the democrats to stay
the current coalition is absolutely necessary for the country and for the reform we are making diaconescu said we cannot accept either a minority cabinet or early elections
the peasant party promised to sign another long-lasting agreement with the democrats who are led by former prime minister petre roman
if the democrats leave the government new elections are unlikely they might still back government initiatives in parliament
roman said last week that the democrats would join with no other party leaving ciorbea at the head of a minority government
initial reaction from the democrats was cool adrian severin a former foreign minister and vice president of the party acknowledged that ciorbea's tone was positive
however he added this crisis will not be solved with a few beautiful words
romania badly needs foreign investment to help with its reform efforts and some leaders said such political instability hurt
varujan vosganian head of the senate's finance committee said that foreign investors needed a stable government to help guarantee their investments
ciorbea used his appearance monday to present his government's objectives for 1998 he said inflation is likely to be between 30-40 percent and predicted a deficit of about 45 percent of gdp
the state ownership fund aims to privatize almost 1600 of 4000 state companies along with three important banks
he said the government would try to keep the national currency the leu from falling against the us dollar
about 1000 teen-agers rioted for a third day monday in the northern city of slupsk where a 13-year-old basketball fan died over the weekend after a policeman hit him with a nightstick
about 400 police officers used tear gas against the teen-agers who gathered outside police headquarters chanting blood for blood
on sunday more than 30 police officers were injured and 22 police cars damaged about 80 people were arrested
the disturbances began after a basketball game saturday
przemek czaja was crossing the street with hundreds of other fans when police intervened to break up the crowd police said the crowd was unruly but fans said they merely were crossing the street against a red light
the boy died on the way to the hospital his funeral is scheduled for wednesday
a spokesman for national police headquarters in warsaw pawel biedziak said an autopsy showed the boy was injured fatally when he bumped into a post
but the policeman who struck the boy was arrested while prosecutors investigate bp-aet-ms-pfg

i've spent many years studying communication between men and women teaching classes and seminars on the subject and working personally with hundreds of couples and i always come back to the same conclusion - communication that works always has honesty as its foundation
it's when you're dishonest about how you feel in relationships that things get messy unpleasant and complicated
one of the biggest problems i have with the old-fashion advice is that it's mainly based on emotional dishonesty - pretending withholding even lying
this week's tip to good communication in relationships is that you should always be honest about your feelings i call this emotional honesty naturally you have to integrate your honesty with common sense
for instance i don't suggest walking up to a guy at a party whom you've never spoken to before and saying excuse me i just want to be emotionally honest and let you know that you look great in those jeans and i feel like dragging you into the bedroom
such an approach goes way beyond honesty the emotional honesty i'm talking about is the kind you either do or don't express to a man at different stages of an intimate relationship
emotional honesty creates intimacy - have you ever had a talk with someone where you were both really honest about yourselves how did you feel afterwards closer no doubt that's because emotional honesty creates instant intimacy it builds a bridge between your heart and the heart of the person you're with it's as if honesty opens the door to your heart so a man can feel the real you inside
what should you be emotionally honest about whatever is true for you
for instance if a guy calls and you're happy to hear from him tell him just that i'm happy to hear from you
it's a lot simpler to be emotionally honest than to follow the old-fashion advice and try not to say anything that might make you seem attainable
if you aren't emotionally honest with a man you're involved with you'll find the relationship staying on a superficial level the more you both share the more intimacy you'll experience and the more likely you'll be to create a future together
your emotional honesty gives your partner permission to open up - when you are emotionally honest with a man it gives him permission to be emotionally honest with you it makes it safer for him to talk from his heart something many men feel awkward doing
if a man senses that you're holding back he'll keep his guard up he can't open up if he can't feel that you want to get closer
when you share your feelings his trust in you builds and his walls come down why wait for him to be the first to open the door you could wait forever remember most not all men are less comfortable sharing feelings than most women so reach out with honesty no matter what happens you can't lose an honest man who's right for you will always respect you for being emotionally honest
emotional honesty prevents misunderstandings - imagine a man and a woman who've been dating for a month both really like each other butare playing hard to get acting aloof pretending they're too busy to see the other much in other words they're being emotionally dishonest
she's thinking he obviously doesn't like me very much i probably should stop seeing him
he's thinking she seems so cold when she's with me i'll bet i'm not her type at all i probably shouldn't call her again
the relationship ends and neitherwill everknowthat their emotional dishonesty sabotaged what could have been a good relationship
pretending you don't feel something only rips you and the other person off do you really want to risk losing a possible mr right by acting cool and unattainable
emotional dishonesty reinforces negative character traits - holding back good feelings about someone trains you to be emotionally dishonest with everyone soon you forget how you really feel you're so busy putting on an act
emotional dishonesty can attract the wrong man into your life - there are men will love it if you're emotionally dishonest and if your feelings remain hidden these are the same guys that the old-fashion advice foolishly warned you about who will get bored' with you if you reveal too much i say go ahead and reveal away the kind of man who needs to be kept constantly stimulated like a restless two-year-old is not going to make a good husband boyfriend or even a good date
being emotionally honest is one of the best ways to screen out emotionally frightened men just open up and watch them run here's something to help you remember why this week's tip is important good men hate it when you secretly test him to see if he's who you want
when you pretend you don't care to see if he'll chase after you
when you act unimpressed with him and his efforts to woo you
when you act like he's not making an impact on you
when your distance makes him feel that it's not safe to get more involved
good men love it when you're honest about what you expect and what you're looking for
when you let him know where he stands so he can feel safe in the relationship
when you share your enthusiasm for him and his efforts
when you express how good he makes you feel
when you open your heart and share the truth so he can feel safe enough to get even more serious about you

need for realistic ceiling price of low-cost houses

different authorities appear to be sending differing signals on the price of low-cost house over the past 10 days the views of the federal government pricing of such units during these difficult times do not appear to be in consonance with that of at least one state government
many especially builders bankers and even some economists suggest that it would be far far wiser to increase prices of low-cost units rather than keep an unrealistic lid on them
ten days ago on jan 4 the housing and local government minister datuk dr ting chew peh declared the rm25000 ceiling price on low-cost units will not be increased despite a recommendation from the national housing department that it be raised to a maximum of rm42000 in some areas
the rationale behind the recommendations of the nhd was based on solid grounds the nhd had conducted a two-month survey which revealed findings that developers had long known the price of land in locations like the capital city and its conurbations of satellite towns on penang island within the metropolitan area of the southern city of johor baru and even within the precincts of the historical city of malacca makes it economically unviable for both the public and private sector developers to build and sell low-cost dwellings at rm25000
as ting said given the current economic sitution the time was not exactly appropriate for a price increase thus it stands to reason why his ministry would not submit any proposal as submitted by the nhd to the cabinet for an increase in price his ministry would only review the price of such houses once the economy improved
this assessment on the pricing of low-cost housing does not appear to be shared by at least one authority at the implementation level for from the northern state of perlis emerges a discordant view last wednesday the perlis mentri besar datuk seri shahidan kassim announced that the state will sell low-cost houses for as much as rm35000 each instead of the ceiling price of rm25000
the arguments he presented to back the state's decision appear to be logical and sound few will disagree with his contention that developers could not afford to stick to the ceiling price because of the high costs of purchase of land and of construction
according to him the high costs of land a huge outlay for landfills and the low profit margin have long discouraged the private sector from building low-cost units the former general manager of the state economic development corporation mat noh sulaiman is reported to have said that the cost of reclaiming former padi land and swampy areas - a common feature across the state - is far more than the rm25000 fixed ceiling price for low-cost housing
because of high outlays the private sector has been and is still reluctant indeed disinclined to build low-cost units an important fact is that in states like perlis development projects are not as extensive as those say in the capital city or in its surrounding areas this does not allow the factor of cross-subsidy an important element in building low-cost units as a result the state economic development corporation had to assume the task of constructing 80 per of low cost units and the state government had sustained losses even when it built low-cost units in higher grounds in sites such as in and around the town of arau
the divergent views of the perlis state government and the minister of housing and local government throw into sharp relief a few moot points in housing one land is a state matter the federal consituition accords the states this prerogative they have the final say in the utilisation of the land within their jurisdiction the federal government can coerce but the final decision is vested in the state executive councils an illustration is the revocation of the permit granted to a private company to redevelop the recreation area in subang jaya denying residents a green lung
two as land is a state matter it is logical that housing is a state matter by extension pricing of low-cost housing is the prerogative of state and local authorities who are the final arbiters of property development plans they decide and approve plans and they should be the authorities to determine the price of low-cost housing
three the pricing of low-cost housing if the housing and local government insists that the ceiling price for low-cost housing is capped at rm25000 developers would be reluctant to build these units which are in demand even in these difficult times
all are cognisant of the fact that the property development sector is winding down thousands of workers though most are foreigners and many illegal workers face the peril of losing their jobs but that sector could still contribute in no small measure to the economy if it is allowed to focus its construction in housing which is still in demand like low-cost housing to make them build these units the price might have to be increased to as much as rm42000 in some areas as the nhd recommends
as for affordability many low- and lower-middle income households can raise funds to buy houses priced between rm30000 and rm50000 two income households are common they take home anywhere between rm1500 and rm2500 they would have some savings then there is the epf from which they can withdraw up to 30 per cent of their accummulated savings the rest they could easily borrow from financial instituitions
in the final analysis the main issue at these difficult times is to keep consumption growing ultimately that is what economy is about if we do not consume the economy would contract and that is not healthy for the nation
one way to prod consumption is to build more low-cost units even if they are priced at rm42000 this will keep the contractors in business keep many workers employed contribute to the economy in several ways like consumption and making loan repayments to banks clearly then these are times that call for an increase in the price of low-cost houses not keeping a lid on them
former us army sgt 1st class clyde lee conrad convicted of treason in 1990 for leaking nato and american secrets to the soviet bloc died in the german prison where he was serving a life sentence he was 50
prosecutors in koblenz confirmed monday that conrad died last thursday apparently from heart failure an autopsy has been ordered the statement said
conrad was convicted on june 6 1990 of masterminding an espionage ring that sold highly sensitive information to hungarian and former czechoslovakian intelligence agents from 1975 through 1985 when he retired after 20 years in the military

in a tit-for-tat move macedonian authorities revoked border visas for greeks on monday further hampering the flow of goods and traffic between the two balkan states
this latest move by the skopje authorities forces all greeks wishing to cross into neighboring macedonia to first apply for a visa in athens more than 500 kilometers 310 miles south of the border
the measure is seen as an unwilling reciprocity after diplomatic negotiations over the past two months failed to establish a flexible border regimen
since november macedonian citizens applying for a visa for greece can do so only in the former's skopje liaison office
the trade exchange between greece and macedonia grossed a total of dlrs 180 million in 1996 and has been on the rise since
the two states have been involved in a six-year dispute over macedonia's name dating back to the breakup of former yugoslavia of which macedonia was a part
greece claims macedonia is the name of its northern province and not the former yugoslav republic

vitamin k was discovered by a danish scientist henrik dam in 1935 it is essentially an anti-haemorrhagic haemorrhage means bleeding factor
vitamin k was named as such a coagulation vitamin
chemically vitamin k is a fat soluble yellowish crystalline compound it is stable to heat air and moisture but is destroyed by strong acids alkalis and light
there are several forms ofvitamin k but all belong to the family of chemical compounds called quinones the two important forms are vitamin k phylloquinones which occurs naturally in green plants and vitamin k2 menaquinone which is a product of bacterial synthesis in the intestines
in the human body vitamin k is absorbed with the aid of bile in the upper part of the small intestine
normal blood clotting mechanism requires vitamin k failure of this will cause bleeding from various organs such as the nose gums vagina stomach and even the brain
bleeding especially gastrointestinal and intra-cerebral can be an acute medical emergency there can also be blood in the urine a deficiency of vitamin k can result from various conditions such as lack of bile salts which are essential for the proper absorption of the vitamin k
a diminution of the bacterial source of vitamin k in the intestines that often results when oral antibiotics or sulphur drugs are being administered for a long time
the frequent use of mineral oils as laxatives which prevent vitamin k absorption
gastrointestinal disorders such as ulcerative colitis regional enteritis sprue and coeliac disease
an obstruction of the liver or gall bladder

in the newborn infants the vitamin k deficiency can occur for the normal intestinal flora has not established itself until sometime after birth
some doctors advocate vitamin k injections for them especially when performing circumcisions or other surgical procedures best performed after about a week to 10 days after birth
the source of vitamin k is usually from vegetables such as cabbage cauli-flowers spinach green leafy vegetables soybean oil and tomatoes
vitamin k2 is from the extensive bacterial synthesis of the vitamin in the intestines

when he next visits this region the international monetary fund imf's managing director michel camdessus should be learning as much about the regional economies as he is teaching them
the imf standard prescription developed during the bailout of the south american economies in the 1980s is not only ineffective in overcoming the crisis in the three asian countries that have so far sought its assistance but is spawning new problems
this has led to the imf being a target of severe criticisms from within these countries as well as from parties in the west
the currencies of thailand indonesia and south korea continue to come under strong selling pressure despite the imf bailout and tough economic measures these countries are being forced to implement
there is now the fear that the imf rules and regulations may cause the economy of these countries to deflate spawning mass unemployment and crippling inflation
already food shortages caused by panic buying are pushing up prices in indonesia and thailand
harvard economist jeffrey sachs had accused the imf of administering a whole lot of remedies that are totally inapproriate for the asian problems
repeating the charges at a business conference in madras on saturday sachs said the imf had aggravated asia's financial crisis but he was confident that regional economies should begin to recover before long
his prediction on asian economic recovery came just a day after prime minister datuk seri dr mahathir mohamad predicted that the malaysian economy would begin to show moderate recovery in six months to a year
sachs the director of harvard institute of international development told the conference that the crisis in east asian economies had resulted from a panic withdrawal of funds from their markets
he said the imf had erred by using the same rescue technique employed in the past instead of specific remedies tailored to the differing needs of asian economies
he criticised the imf for demanding bank closures in indonesia thailand and south korea as part of its bailout packages which sachs said sent wrong signals to the market
the malaysian government has repeatedly maintain since the outbreak of the regional crisis that it will try its best to avoid seeking imf and other outside assistance
although the statement to that effect was then seen by critics of the prime minister as totally inappropriate and arrogant the wisdom of avoiding an imf bailout is being widely recognised now
it is better to adopt our own tough belt-tightening measures than to wait for the economy to spin out of control by which time a bailout by the imf becomes a matter of necessity
apart from deepening its understanding of asian problems the imf may have to examine its relationship with the us and other western governments as there are now allegations that it is being used by these governments to dominate asian economies
commentator janet bush writing in the london's times newspaper on december 24 said there were overwhelming signs to prove that the imf bailout of asia amounts to a deliberate policy of laying the region open to takeover by foreign interests
she noted that american investment banking group goldman sachs was reported to be preparing to spend us$4 billion us$1 rm463 buying asset- backed loans from stricken japanese banks the purchase is equivalent to one-eighth of all japan's bad loans
bush commented other american investment banks which learnt the art of buying and repackaging bad loans during the latin american debt crisis of the 1980s will surely follow
these forays are the very early signs of an american takeover of asia's financial and banking sectors aided and abetted by the international monetary fund
lest anyone dismiss this as a silly conspiracy theory just remember the speech that mickey kantor former us commerce secretary made to the confederation of british industry last month
he told his audience that the troubles of the tiger economies should be seized as a golden opportunity for the west to reassert its commercial interests
when countries seek help from the imf he said america and europe should use the imf as a battering ram to gain advantage
so while we seek counsel from camdessus and a whole list of other experts from the developing countries we should also prevail upon them to learn more about our economy
the already uneven playing field will become less level for the developing economies if a multilateral organisation like the imf allows itself to be used by the powerful west

school has reopened and the roads are again filled with schoolbuses for about six weeks before this the roads were less congested as schools were closed for the third term holidays
but as of last monday alarm clocks began to ring at 530am as parents busied themselves preparing breakfast and getting their children ready for school school life began again to the excitement of all involved in it
the gates of kindergartens and schools opened again as new and old pupils rushed in
parents with first-time school-going children were just as anxious as their offspring as i found out recently many took leave from work to tend to their children's first day at school a few fathers carried cameras to school capturing the moments on stills for posterity
one parent i met recently demonstrated a situation which i think is not uncommon nowadays it's a situation where sons rule over fathers and daughters reign over mothers
i met david at a shop selling schoolbags in sungai besi about two weeks ago david sometimes helped his mother at the wet market nearby and i got to know him after becoming a regular customer david had his son with him on that day as they were choosing a schoolbag for the new year
they were arguing over the choice of the bag when i spotted them david was showing his son a plain red-coloured backpack which cost about rm35 according to the price tag but his son was pointing to a multi-coloured bag with a walt disney cartoon on it the bag cost rm55
david was obviously trying to give his son a quick lesson in basic economics he wanted his son to settle for the red bag saying that it could be spotted easily should there be a mix-up but the son refused to be convinced
the son was telling the father that the red bag was too plain too simple furthermore the bag was cheap he said the bag with the cartoon was the one he wanted it would certainly encourage him to study hard because every boy in school would be using similar bags he held on to the bag screaming that he would not budge from his choice
the son's raving and ranting finally won the day david's better judgment would have prevailed but the boy's screaming was the deciding factor i tried to intervene but the boy held on to the bag and refused to let go the indonesian helper looked uninterested wishing only to have the sale concluded as quickly as possible
after david had paid for the bag and his son stopped screaming we sat down for a cup of teh tarik and kopi o at a nearby stall we started exchanging notes about children's school needs and concluded that there had to be much give and take in dealing with them
david gave in because he wanted to make sure his son would go to school
nasib baik dia mau pigi sekolah-oh kalau dia tak mau pigi saya manyak susah luckily he wants to go to school otherwise i'll have a big problem david said in between inhaling his daily intake of nicotine
david could afford the bag easily but he felt that the red one was a better buy the fear that his son would refuse to go to school prompted david to part with rm55 as we sipped our drinks the son wandered off to a side-stall looking at the magazines on display suggesting that there was hope for david after all
david recalled his school days he studied at a school in cheras he was an average student he said preferring to play football to paying attention to his school books david also remembered the hard days when he had to shuttle between his house the school and the pudu wet market where his parents had a stall selling vegetables
he remembers the brown canvas bag he carried to school which cost his parents not more than rm10 depending on the size he had to wake up very early to take the stage-bus together with office workers and other early morning commuters
once when he wanted to buy a purple-coloured t-shirt for his school sports day his father told him to man the vegetable stall for two days to earn his keep but david now sees the wisdom of his father who has since died more than what he learnt at school it was the old man's wise ways with money that david appreciated most
he hoped his son would learn to be thrifty too but he wasn't sure because he wanted his son to spend more time on his school books than helping him at the market just as we parted his son walked up to us asking for rm3 to buy a pack of dragon ball picture cards children buy these cards and exchange them with friends until they have collected a full set

amazingly everyone seems to realise they have a set of teeth only when they have a toothache or when their aesthetics is at stake remember those times when you groan and moan and sleep seemed to elude you because of that gnawing and unbearable pain
or when you felt so embarrassed because of those gaping holes after you lost your four front teeth due to a fight did you dare smile i doubt it
instead what you did was to put your hand over your mouth and run helter skelter to the nearest dental clinic looking for help teeth should never be taken for granted you should nurture and look after them well for teeth adorn the mouth and shape the face
according to american dentist dr f harold wirth the mouth in its entirety is an important and wondrous part of our anatomy our emotion our lives it is the very essence of our very own well-being man without a doubt needs the mouth as a means of speaking of expressing love happiness and joy anger ill temper or sorrow
it is the primary sexual contact hence it is of initial importanceto our regeneration and survival it therefore deserves the greatest care it can receive at any sacrifice
has it ever crossed your mind that much can be learned from your teeth
do you know that their very anatomy reflects among other things gender and dietary preferences
you may find it difficult to imagine but while the main features are essentially the same the shape of the female tooth is somewhat different from that of the male - they are more feminine and smoother
this difference plays a major role in determining whether one looks feminine or mannish when smiling
amazing isn't it but these are important elements that every dental student need to learn so that when they restructure your teeth artificially they can make sure that a woman doesn't look mannish or vice versa
it is most unfortunate that very few of us ever put dental health on top of our list of priorities in fact it seldom bothers anyone when our young ones don't have their front baby teeth some mothers even think that their babies look cute without those front jewels that's all right when they are toddlers but have you thought about how embarrassed they would be when they get older it would probably affect their self-esteem and morale and school would become a torture for them because of the teasing
your children probably prayed and begged the tooth fairy to bring back their smile
some would have became disillusioned because when they look into the mirror they know the tooth fairy never came
worst of all most parents failed to understand why their child looked so dejected and gloomy such is the effect of the lost anterior teeth adults often than not cannot understand what all the fuss over oral health is about until of course they themselves started to loose one two three or all of those front pearls
sure you can replace them with artificial ones but what you fail to understand is that artificial teeth come in different ranges and different price tags
the closer they look to the original the more sophisticated is the treatment procedure thus because expertise and meticulousness becomes the rule of the day the high price tag is unavoidable
and what about when your dentist tells you that your back teeth have holes as big as the black hole of calcutta if nothing is done chewing food becomes difficult
to make it worse the impacted food remains in the cavity and is the cause of searing pain from ear to ear
then there are also those times when you feel embarrassed the moment you notice people keeping their distance whenever you open your mouth to talk because they cannot stand your bad breadth
to add salt to injury when you ask your dentist to pull it out he looks aghast because his training teaches him to preserve teeth not to pull them out and when the build and repair has been completed it is your turn to look in awe at the bill you have to foot your dental problems obviously doesn't seem to end
but dental costs need not be expensive if you practise prevention from an early age there is a lot you can do to avoid dental problems
your dentist will tell you that regular checkups are worth an ounce of cure it is during this time that dentists can identify and treat any new lesions they may find
early lesions can be checked from progressing with the use of very simple materials and minimal pain techniques
you can preserve your dentition for a long time and maintain your quality of life until old age if yougo to the dentist only when in pain it indicates you already have serious problems and this means more money to pay for the cure'
then there are all those oral hygiene devices from toothbrushes to mouthwashes that can help keep your oral health good it is just a matter of wanting to do it in short the old adage prevention is better than cure' should be adopted as an everyday lifestyle

one of the nicest things about living in a cosmopolitan society is that we get to share and celebrate festivals of our fellow malaysians - and of course their food
into the first week of the ramadan we already are indulging whole heartedly in the variety of food that makes its annual appearance during this period
cyn and i made our way to the hotel istana where the tantalising smells from a sneak preview of the ramadan buffet spread beckoned fadzillah and bernice joined us
the chef has planned a lavish menu for the ramadan but for the preview he had selected choice dishes for our table of four
we start with sup lautan bersantan this is a mildly spicy soup with prawns crabmeat and scallops the prawns and crab are shelled - i never quite know how to eat crab in their shell when served in soup after all just a quarter piece seems too miniscule a portion to bother getting down to the intricacies of fingerwork
the prawns are fresh and crunchy contrasting with the softness of the oyster mushrooms and the fresh scallops the flavour of lengkuas is sharp enhancing the aroma of the thin coconut milk
to go with the various dishes mostly spicy is nasi tumpang described as coconut rice it is definitely more than the all-too-familiar nasi lemak
chopped coriander leaves and slivers of browned garlic fragrants up the grains of basmati rice
a religious vow prohibits me from consuming beef so i had to give the rendang ekor daun pudina a miss it looked beautifully done though and smelled equally wonderful cyn is surprised to find out that it's oxtail
despite the bones and that it's not very rendang' she enjoyed the mild spiciness and the tender bits of meat
ayam bakar madu is heavily loaded with the flavour of cumin which i find a little too overpowering the spring chicken used is naturally tender and sweet from the honey a sprinkle of sesame seeds give it a nutty crunch
oh but cyn and i simply loved the gulai tempoyak ikan jelawat cyn is a little bothered by the fine bones that run criss-cross through the fish but for me the taste and the smooth texture of the fish more than makes up for the bother of picking out these tiny bones
tempoyak or fermented durian can be quite strong in flavour and is definitely an acquired taste in this dish tough it is used sparingly and while allowing the essence of tempoyak to seep through the sauce it does not take so prominent a place that nothing else matters
a word of warning though if you are in a hurry forget about ikan jelawat like terubok tongsan and most other freshwater fish ikan jelawat is not something you want to rush through but the smooth and sweet flesh when you take your time to savour it
the chef is pretty fond of the root herb lengkuas or galangal using it again in his udang masak lengkuas but here he has quite surpassed himself adding a western twist with the addition of halved red grapes which i had mistakenly thought were shallots at first
so it is a pleasant surprise when they burst forth with a refreshing juiciness in the mouth
the prawns are cooked in their shells to retain all the flavours and sweetness but employing a simple trick of cutting through the shell at the back to remove the vein allows diners to remove the shells easily without the need to use their hands
sliced onions and quartered tomatoes provide a piquant touch and the resulting thick sauce is simply perfect with the rice preferably plain white
white rice is served daily at the ramadan buffet in addition to the changes of flavoured rice of which there is almond briyani tomato rice dhall rice fried rice with pineapple hokkien fried rice and nasi minyak
for those who don't want rice daily variations of noodles fried kueh teow mee mamak laksa curry mee ee-fu noodles etc are freshly prepared at a cooking station
in fact the buffet menu is rotated on a seven-day basis with some 40 dishes from salads cold cuts local ulam sambal to soups western-style main course meat and seafood curries and dessert
dishes also include specialties of the various ethnic groups like ikan masak asam nyonya kambing masala wonton noodles lemang ayam masak sarawak telur java yong tofu chicken tikka etc
the buffet is priced at rm48 adult and rm29 children for the convenience of muslims who wish to perform their maghrib prayers there is a surau located on the mezzanine floor of the hotel
but nothing quite beats the ambience of the taman sari during the ramadan there is something quite dreamy about huge cream-coloured marquee erected at the garden lanai right outside the brasserie next to the swimming pool and flames from rows of lighted pelita lamps flicker in the night like an army of fireflies
here warong stalls have been set up to create a hawker scene offering items from chicken rice to popiah roti canai tandoori cucur udang etc
in addition two lebanese chefs have flown in to add a jordanian touch with shawarma tabouleh fatouch humus shanklish sambousik chicken wings with lemon sauce shiskbarak kofta bukhari rice and even hot lebanese desserts
for our dessert the chef has prepared manisan nangka dan ais krim
slices of aromatic jackfruit are served with slightly melted ice cream lending their special flavour to the dish
but this is not all there will be a daily selection of desserts from cakes and pastries to more traditional items like pengat bubur kacang tapai pulut kuih serawa pisang and fresh fruit

iraq declared monday it would block arms inspections by an american-led un team renewing iraqi claims that americans were slanting the inspections the challenge threatened a new confrontation with the united nations
the official iraqi news agency made the announcement quoting an official spokesman who said the presence of too many american inspectors was prolonging the inspections program and delaying removal of un sanctions on iraq
the agency's statement came after american scott ritter and a team of un inspectors reportedly visited a hospital and a prison in baghdad
apparently the team was not blocked since the agency's report said the ban on ritter would begin tuesday
iraq has repeatedly criticized ritter accusing him of spying for the cia
ritter a former marine major who has been an inspector for six years and served in the 1991 gulf war has dismissed the charge as absolutely untrue
ritter was heavily involved in the inspections of sensitive sites that led to last october's standoff between iraq and the weapons inspectors
the government spokesman said monday that ritter's team included too many americans and britons he said it would not be allowed to continue until it was reformed in a balanced manner
the official who was not identified by the agency said the team included nine americans five britons a russian and an australian
this shows striking evidence of the imbalance in the composition of the team and its methods of action in iraq the spokesman said
in new york un secretary-general kofi annan said no decision has been taken to halt inspections in the wake of iraq's statement on ritter he noted that the chief weapons inspector richard butler was to travel to baghdad for talks jan 19
butler is due to talk to the iraqi authorities about their barring the un teams from some 60 sites including about 40 presidential palaces on grounds of national sovereignty
i hope that the iraqi authorities will not do anything precipitous and will wait for mr butler to get there to raise whatever issues they have with him annan told reporters
iraq's un ambassador nizar hamdoon said iraq considered such a large percentage of british and americans on the ritter team to be unacceptable
iraq has insisted that the work of the special commission especially on the inspection side should be more balanced in composition hamdoon said therefore iraq is not going to accept this heavily influenced team by the american and british nationals
the other un inspection teams in iraq would be allowed to continue their work hamdoon said
the us ambassador to the un bill richardson reminded reporters that the security council meets tuesday
iraq is up to its old tricks richardson said in florida we feel the security council should make a strong response
the white house issued a similar reaction spokesman mike mccurry said the world had heard provocative statements from the government of iraq on the constitution of un inspection teams over and over again they have been met with the same resolved response of the international community
in baghdad the iraqi spokesman also accused american arms inspectors of carrying out activities detrimental to iraq's national interest
they have been falsifying facts inventing lies deliberately prolonging the process and sending false reports to the security council the agency quoted him as saying
in november iraqi leader saddam hussein ordered american inspectors out of the country on the grounds they were spies the united nations then withdrew all of its inspectors in protest and the united states started a military buildup in the gulf that continues to this day
the inspectors were allowed to return a week later under a russian-brokered deal inspections have resumed without confrontation since then although iraq still refuses to allow inspectors into saddam's palaces and other so-called sensitive sites
the united nations has said that trade sanctions imposed on iraq after its 1990 invasion of kuwait will not be lifted until its weapons of mass destruction are eliminated
iraq insists it has destroyed those weapons but the un special commission has accused the iraqi regime of hiding information and materials related to arms production

as a retired academic who once served in malaysia in the late 1950s i was exceedingly happy to be able to afford a holiday here
my trip to malaysia was only marred by one particularly galling incident this was my visit to universiti malaya which should now perhaps be renamed university mcdonald's driving past the front gates the sight that greeted my eyes was one which i could never have prepared myself for
emblazoned upon the facade of the red-brick edifice that has cropped up in front of the university was the garish legend restoran mcdonald's i was dumbstruck by the spectacle which confirmed my deepest fears that the tentacles of the american multinational corporations have at last breached the once inviolable walls of the universities
this company has now struck its flag at the very threshold of the institution of higher learning itself but surely it must strike some of the members of the public that the entrance to the premier university of the land is perhaps not the most ideal spot for a fast-food chain
it is a well-known fact that the political leadership of this country has been at the forefront of criticising the west for its attempts at cultural imperialism
am i to conclude that this prodigious fight has been lost on the green fields of um
i am sure that for some readers my response to this situation would indicate that i am nothing more than a has-been hopelessly out of touch with the pulse of the present but let me remind them that in the not-too-distant past the ivory towers of academe were preoccupied with the task of educating the young a practice that has perhaps gone out of fashion these days
will there come a time i wonder when one can buy a mcdegree from the mcuniversity and will such a degree come with the obligatory coca-cola
one need only add that if the authorities in question do not act to correct this situation they are in danger of turning themselves into the laughing stock of the academic community worldwide

iraq will block any arms inspections by a un team led by the us national scott ritter the government said monday setting the stage for a new confrontation with the united nations
an government spokesman said the presence of too many americans on the teams was prolonging the inspections program and delaying the lifting of un sanctions on iraq the official iraqi news agency reported
the agency's statement came after ritter and a team of un inspectors reportedly visited a hospital and a prison in baghdad
the statement said the ban on ritter would begin jan 13 tuesday
the un security council is due to meet tuesday and us ambassador to the un bill richardson made clear the iraqi move would be discussed
iraq is up to its old tricks richardson said in palm beach fla we feel the security council should make a strong response
in washington a national security council official said the ban on ritter's team was in clear violation of un demands for full access to suspected weapons sites
it is not for saddam hussein to determine the composition of these inspection teams said the official referring to the iraqi president
iraq has repeatedly criticized ritter accusing him of spying for the cia
ritter a former marine major who has been an inspector for six years has dismissed the charge as absolutely untrue
ritter was heavily involved in the inspections of sensitive sites that led to last october's standoff between iraq and the weapons inspectors
last month iraqi deputy prime minister tariq aziz took journalists to a baghdad building that ritter had tried to inspect
this is the notorious building aziz said with a smile which mr ritter wanted to inspect in his last leg of inspections in september and our refusal for that led to a fury at the un security council
on monday the iraqi government spokesman said ritter's team included too many americans and britons it would not be allowed to continue until it was reformed in a balanced manner
the team included nine americans five britons a russian and an australian said the unidentified official
this shows striking evidence of the imbalance in the composition of the team and its methods of action in iraq the spokesman said
in new york un secretary-general kofi annan said no decision has been taken to halt inspections in the wake of iraq's statement on ritter he noted that the chief weapons inspector richard butler was to travel to baghdad for talks jan 19
butler is due to talk to the iraqi authorities about their barring the un teams from some 60 sites including about 40 presidential palaces on grounds of national sovereignty
i hope that the iraqi authorities will not do anything precipitous and will wait for mr butler to get there to raise whatever issues they have with him annan told reporters
iraq's un ambassador nizar hamdoon said iraq considered such a large percentage of british and americans on the ritter team to be unacceptable
iraq has insisted that the work of the special commission especially on the inspection side should be more balanced in composition hamdoon said therefore iraq is not going to accept this heavily influenced team by the american and british nationals
the other un inspection teams in iraq would be allowed to continue their work hamdoon said
in baghdad the iraqi spokesman also accused american arms inspectors of carrying out activities detrimental to iraq's national interest
they have been falsifying facts inventing lies deliberately prolonging the process and sending false reports to the security council the agency quoted him as saying
during last fall's confrontation iraq accused american inspectors of spying on iraq and helping plan for us air strikes un officials denied the charges and pulled all weapons inspectors out of the country the impasse was ended with russian mediation
the inspectors' job is to certify that iraq has fulfilled its obligation under un resolutions to eliminate its weapons of mass destruction
sanctions imposed on iraq following its 1990 invasion of neighboring kuwait _ which include a ban on the export of oil _ cannot be lifted until the un security council accepts that iraqi weapons programs have been halted
iraq maintains it has fulfilled the requirements under security council resolutions but the weapons inspectors have repeatedly accused the government of president saddam hussein of hiding weapons and the means to manufacture them lb-ggl/jbm

for many communities in developing countries the major source of vitamin a in the diet is carotenoids the precursors of the vitamin
these compounds are synthesised only by photosynthetic organisms and by members of the plant kingdom where they serve important functions in the metabolism including participating in the photosynthetic process
these pigments also provide aesthetic qualities as colourants in the plant and animal kingdoms many red-orange colours found in foods are due to the presence of carotenoids
most importantly the carotenoids serve the animal kingdom as sources of vitamin a activity
major advances have taken place now in understanding the role and mechanism of the action of carotenoids
in addition to their classical role as vitamin a precursors they are now thought to play specific roles in mammalian tissue which is related to their function in plants
in view of the wide medical importance of carotenoids the institute for medical research has conducted studies into the occurrence of these pigments in a wide variety of foods so as to provide information on their food sources the pattern of occurrence of these pigments in the blood of malaysians has also been studied
there are some 500 carotenoids occurring naturally however only less than a dozen occur in significant quantities in the foods which are commonly consumed
the vitamin a activity of the carotenoids varies considerably b-carotene is often considered as fully converted to vitamin a activity of 100 per cent
a-carotene on the other hand has only 50 per cent of the activity of b-carotene there are many carotenoids which do not have vitamin a activity for example lycopene the focus of this letter
without going into too much of the chemistry of the carotenoids the figure illustrating the structure of lycopene and b-carotene clearly shows the vast differences in the two compounds which all the same possess basic similarities the ring structures at the end of the b-carotene molecule are important in the process of conversion to vitamin a
carotenoids with their highly reactive conjugated double bonds see structure given act as free radical traps or antioxidants and may play an important role in the prevention of various types of cancer
this has generated a lot of excitement in the scientific community it is also thought that the carotenoids do not have to be converted to vitamin a in order to have this antioxidant effect
thus carotenoids without any vitamin a activity as for example lycopene can also be a powerful antioxidant
nutritionists are however not recommending that consumers swallow lycopene or other carotenoid pills in the hope that these antioxidants will keep them from contracting cancers
it is important to identify foods that are rich in this carotenoid and to encourage the consumption of these daily
our series of studies have shown that lycopene is not widely found in all vegetables and fruits in vegetables the only significant source is tomato occurring at a concentration of about 700 ug per 100g or in two medium-size tomatoes
two local fruits - papaya and watermelon - are also very good sources of lycopene papaya has a lycopene level of about 2000 ug per 100g or 3000 ug in one slice of papaya of 150g whereas watermelon has a concentration of 5000 ug per 100g or 7500 ug in one thin slice of the fruit of 150g
at these concentrations they are three to seven times higher than that in tomato it must be remembered though that for both fruits it must be the red variety that has the highest content of lycopene
these data support the healthy eating messages that nutritionists often emphasise - that is eat more vegetables and fruits and within this group eat a variety of them

a total of 300 squatters from kampung lindungan petaling jaya are expected to move into temporary longhouses at batu 10 near the commerce square project at the end of the month
kelana jaya state assemblyman datuk mohd mokthar ahmad dahlan said classic horizons sdn bhd the developer of commerce square will build the longhouses at the former squatter colony in kampung lindungan
classic horizon will undertake a 20-storey low-cost flats project on a 46ha site to house 1000 squatters
mohd mokthar said the company was finalising the the project details with the state government
they are discussing the premium and layout plans with the selangor state housing development board at the moment he told the new straits times yesterday
mohd mokthar said the developer will be submitting the building plan for the project to the petaling jaya municipal council
he said construction should begin by the middle of the year and was expected to be completed in 18 to 24 months
on a similar project in kampung penaga mohd mokthar said 170 squatters from the settlement had been relocated to longhouses nearby
he said a former mining pool had been turned into a temporary site for the squatters
tds management sdn bhd which is carrying out a mixed development project at kampung penaga built the longhouses besides helping to construct a kindergarten and surau for the squatters
mohd mokthar said the the unit provided by the developer for the kindergarten was too small as the number of pre-school children had grown
the squatter affairs committee had also requested the mppj to provide bins-on-wheels at the longhouses
i have already spoken to the mppj on saturday to provide the squatters with the bins to collect the rubbish and they have promised to bring the bins over by this week he said
mohd mokthar said the committee approached him recently to request the developer to improve the condition of the roads
he said they had also requested that the surau be upgraded

chinese teenager chen yan shut out the maelstrom surrounding her country's latest drug scandal by starting an expected run of golds as the pool competition started at the world swimming championships began monday
as her disgraced teammate yuan yuan and coach zhou zhewen arrived back in beijing after their failed attempt to smuggle banned human growth hormones into australia chen won the women's 400-meter individual medley
it was one of four gold medals shared around in the pool monday us competitor jenny thompson a strong critic of the chinese on saturday won her first individual world title when she claimed the 100-meter freestyle event in the opening race
olympic 100-meter breaststroke champion frederick deburghgraeve of belgium the world record holder and atlanta gold medalist who came into the meet low on form won the gold medal in one minute 134 seconds more than a second off his world mark
michael klim of australia did not let the disappointment of missing a world record let him celebrate victory in the men's 200-meter freestyle
it was the fourth time klim had turned at 150 meters ahead of schedule to break the oldest men's records in the books but failed to covert
how do i feel the best in the world klim said
swimming's world governing body fina continued to look embarrassingly out of touch with public sentiment on the drugs issue as it struggled to clear up the mess caused when yuan had 13 vials of growth hormones seized thursday
secretary gunnar werner's attempts to turn the blame of a lack of speed in the matter onto australian customs officials and the australian sports commission led to fresh allegations against him
an australian sports commission spokesman said fina had mislead reporters on the government agency's role in getting official documents sent to perth
fina were provided with a contact number for customs on friday and after-hours number for customs and they chose not to use that the spokesman said instead they chose to send a letter to a fax number they knew was in an unattended room
fina announced late monday it had finally received a report which was completed friday it will form a crucial plank as fina builds a case for a minimum four-year ban for yuan and zhou
werner under attack at daily news conferences for the inaction in the drugs case canceled regular midday briefings as his distaste for the constant questions on the issue became clear
he urged the media to concentrate on the pool
thompson beat chinese favorite shan ying into third in the opening event to add an individual crown to the record five olympic golds she has won _ all in relays
the time wasn't the greatest but i'm really happy with the gold medal for our team thompson said of her 5495-second time well outside le jingyi of china's world record of 5401 it's just one step closer to winning gold in 2000
martina moravcova of slovakia who has trained for three years at southern methodist university in dallas texas was second in 5509 and shan clocked 5510
sandra voelker of germany and amy van dyken of the united states were one-two after 50 meters but van dyken faded to fourth and the german to fifth
when asked whether her win over a chinese swimmer was any more noteworthy because of the drug scandal facing the chinese team thompson said let's just say that's one clean win
though an interpreter shan said the local media has been unfair to our swim team it's affected our training and life here as an athlete i say they've gone too far
zeng qiliang of china was second in the men's 100-meter breaststroke and kurt grote of the united states third for the bronze
i trained as hard and as much before atlanta but i wasn't motivated said deburghgraeve my life changed so much after atlanta and it was much harder for me
klim admitted he went out seeking italian giorgio lamberti's world record of one minute 4669 seconds _ set in bonn in 1989 he had to settle for 14741
massi rosolino of italy won the silver nearly a second behind klim while pieter van den hoogenband of the netherlands was third
earlier china won a gold medal in the men's three-meter synchronized dive and took silver and bronze in the 10-meter platform
xu hao and yu zhuocheng scored 31350 points in the men's dive debut event while olena zhupyna of ukraine took gold in the 10-meter dive ahead of china's cai yugan and chen li
the men's water polo program had the day off monday as the teams prepared for the semifinals starting tuesday in women's play monday the netherlands won its fifth consecutive match with a 9-1 victory over spain
officials said they would double security for a men's water polo match tuesday between croatia and yugoslavia unruly fans have been ejected from matches involving the teams in the preliminary rounds

the american international group aig inc a us-based insurance conglomerate wants to continue to invest in malaysia because it still has confidence in the country's strong economy deputy prime minister datuk seri anwar ibrahim said
i met aig chairman maurice greenberg today what is significant during this meeting is that he has great confidence in the malaysian economy
he wants to continue to invest here and is committed to remain in malaysia he told reporters after meeting former us secretary of state dr henry kissinger prior to the two-day pacific dialogue in kuala lumpur yesterday
anwar was asked whether greenberg who will participate in the dialogue starting today discussed the status of 100 per cent ownership of american international assurance its subsidiary company in malaysia
during the recent world trade organisation wto negotiations most of the organisation's members have agreed with malaysia's offer of 51 per cent foreign ownership and 49 per cent to locals for insurance companies operating in the country the aig however opposed the offer and wanted the 100 per cent ownership to remain
i explained malaysia's policy vis-a-vis the arrangement that we agreed on during the wto round of negotiations but he greenberg said he preferred to pursue discussions and negotiations on the issue
i said we look forward to viewing some of his specific proposals he added
asked on the proposals put forward by greenberg anwar declined to elaborate saying that it is still at a preliminary stage
his greenberg proposals were known even to american negotiators in geneva but that has somewhat been cleared after the final settlement in the wto agreement
now that it is over he greenberg has now come back with some other measures which i think are very preliminary at this stage i look forward to see his other measures during the pacific dialogue tomorrow he added
asked whether malaysia will compromise with greenberg pertaining to the foreign ownership in insurance companies operating in malaysia anwar said there has been a lot of compromise already but i think what is important is to get a clear undertaking from him greenberg to continue to have the confidence and invest in malaysia he added
anwar also said the other american companies that will participate in the dialogue today have indicated their commitment to continue to invest in the country
i am pleased with this year's attendance especially from the us business community this is a welcome signal of continued relations not only because of the dialogue but they have also indicated their strong commitment to continue to invest and work together with the malaysian counterparts in improving the economy of this country
some of them have indicated this commitment when i met some of them today he added
anwar was also asked whether the government will revise the country's growth rate in view of the sharp fall in the ringgit last week
he said the government is confident the ringgit will slightly recover and strengthen in the next few weeks
as we have said earlier the ringgit has been grossly undervalued and we also have to take other measures including intervention to ensure the ringgit would further strengthen we also welcome initiatives like those of the international monetary fund and the world bank and now the commitment and indication of support by the us following the decision to send its deputy treasury secretary lawrence summers to jakarta and kuala lumpur
i think this would give a clear signal that there is equal concern and commitment of the us to further strengthen the economy of these two countries to ensure that the value of currencies reflect the economic fundamentals he said adding he will be meeting summers on wednesday
he also reminded malaysians not to listen to rumours that there is tension in the country due to the sharp depreciation of the ringgit against the us dollar
it is unfortunate if we choose to entertain such rumours apart from its strong economy malaysia's other strengths include the political stability and cooperation shown by the multi-racial community of the country he said when asked to comment on a singapore-based news report that there is tension among the races in the country due to the economic problem
anwar also warned money changers that their licence would be revoked if they refuse to accept the ringgit in exchange for the us dollars saying it is illogical for them to act in such manner
he was asked on claims that certain money changers had refused to sell us dollars to people intending to visit the us
if this has really happened it must be an isolated case - probably one or two but if there are complaints and evidence action will be taken against them the authorities are monitoring the situation he added
he said so far the finance ministry had not received any official complaint or report on such claims adding the matter was also not raised during his meeting with bank negara and bank officials on saturday

with a controversial former guerrilla leader coming to power in chechnya the russian government appeared divided monday over how to deal with the breakaway southern republic
tensions between russia and chechnya have been escalating in recent weeks but several russian officials sounded a conciliatory note monday and stressed the need for economic cooperation
boris agapov the deputy secretary of russia's security council said russia could learn to work with chechnya's acting prime minister shamil basayev
basayev was a leading field commander in the 1994-6 war with russia and many chechens regard him as a hero but russia considers him an unrepentant terrorist for leading a 1995 hostage-taking raid in southern russia that led to clashes with russian forces more than 100 people were killed
we hope very much that the new chechen government and basayev is on it will be able to cope with the problems facing them agapov was quoted as saying by itar-tass he said basayev had made clear his intention to stabilize the situation in chechnya
yet russia's prosecutor general yuri skuratov said monday that an arrest warrant was still valid for basayev
no matter who he is for us he is a man who is charged with grave crimes including terrorism skuratov told a news conference
such mixed signals have been the hallmark of russia's policy toward chechnya in recent days reflecting tensions between hardliners and moderates in russia's government
one russian hardliner called last week for pre-emptive strikes against chechen bandits while moderates emphasized the need for compromise in remarks monday
president boris yeltsin wants to visit chechnya to improve relations with the leaders of the mostly muslim republic yet he is widely reviled in chechnya for launching the 1994-96 war that ultimately failed to crush the chechen separatists
yeltsin's spokesman sergei yastrzhembsky said chechnya remained too volatile for the president to travel there but he added that doesn't relieve federal officials from the task of seeking the most flexible and effective ways to normalize the situation
monday's comments contrasted with the hostile rhetoric between the two sides in recent weeks despite a peace treaty last may the russian-chechen relationship is still filled with friction
a russian delegation led by deputy prime minister ramazan abdulatipov traveled to chechnya over the weekend in a bid to ease tensions abdulatipov said the two sides agreed on joint measures for financing restoration of the war-shattered economy
in chechnya meanwhile basayev has completed his selection of a new government which will officially be announced on tuesday the interfax news agency reported
chechnya's president aslan maskhadov asked basayev to form a government in hopes of bringing greater order and stability to chechnya which is still plagued by armed gangs and frequent kidnappings
the russia-chechnya peace deal has not resolved the all-important question of chechnya's political status chechnya runs its own affairs and considers itself independent but moscow insists the territory is still part of russia

in an effort to promote local goods and to reduce the country's current account deficit the selangor state government will present awards to traders in the state who sell the most local products
selangor menteri besar datuk abu hassan omar said a special award will be given to traders in various categories including supermarkets mini markets retail outlets and specialty stores
speaking at a media conference after launching a campaign on love malaysia buy malaysian goods in selangor yesterday abu hassan said the award has not been named yet
the state government will start awarding traders before the middle of the year he added
if the federal government through the domestic trade and consumer affairs ministry has given recognition to traders who sell goods at lower prices with the fair price shop' award the selangor state government will initiate a new concept in rewarding traders who sell the most local goods he said
he said the state government will work closely with the selangor consumer affairs council in conducting the programme
he said the council will determine the percentage of local goods to be sold at an outlet for the operator to be eligible for the award
abu hassan said the various categories of shops and stores will also be determined later
the programme is opened to traders in selangor and the federal territory
he said the recognition for traders who sell the most local goods is appropriate for the klang valley where most of the shops are located and where the majority of consumers are concentrated
abu hassan who was previously the domestic trade and consumer affairs minister said we hope the campaign will encourage the public to buy local goods at recognised shops and at the same time help to reduce the current account deficit by buying local goods
earlier in his speech abu hassan urged consumers to use their purchasing power to buy local products instead of imported ones to strengthen the country's economy
as consumers we have the power to purchase and we should use it to assist the country's economic system he said
he also urged entrepreneurs to be responsible and fair in conducting their businesses
the development of business ethics is not restricted to the business only it also includes the entrepreneurs' commitment to produce high-quality goods at competitive prices that meet consumers' expectations and tastes he said
abu hassan also encouraged local people to switch to local fruits instead of imported ones
this is because the import of foods has been identified as one of the main contributors to the country's current account deficit
the government spends more than rm10 billion a year to import food
he said it is wrong for some people to assume that the buy malaysian goods campaign is only targeted at a certain section of the population while others are still buying foreign products
the seven-day buy local goods campaign which ends on january 18 sees the participation of 45 local producers selling their goods at manufacturer's prices at the giant hypermarket in usj selangor
the campaign is jointly-organised by the selangor state government giant tmc mca youth and the federation of malaysian manufacturers
the next campaign will be held at taman permata and taman melawati in ulu klang selangor
abu hassan also said the australian statistics bureau had recently reported that between january and november 1997 12000 malaysian tourists visited the country
the figure represents an increase of 10 per cent from the corresponding period in 1996
this illustrates the insensitivity of malaysians to the current economic woes we may ask ourselves where our spirit of nationalism is
he questioned
the soviet union first learned about western projects to develop the atomic bomb from spies in britain and not in the united states according to the co-author of a new book
former kgb agent oleg tsaryov claimed moscow got its first intelligence reports about the western atomic bomb projects from john cairncross a member of britain's most infamous spy ring
his role for the soviet intelligence was enormous tsaryov said in an interview broadcast monday on the bbc i mean he was the first man to give us documentary material on the development of the atomic weapons in britain
britain was the primary source of the atomic secrets and continued to be so from 1941 until 1949 tsaryov added
tsaryov was quoted making similar statements in an interview with the interfax news agency
most previous reports have suggested that the soviet union received much of its key information for building nuclear weapons from spies working in the united states
the new book the crown jewels details the work of cairncross and other members of a spy ring recruited at cambridge university tsaryov's co-author is former conservative lawmaker and spy writer rupert allason who uses the pen name of nigel west
cairncross who died two years ago denied claims by a spy writer that he handed over secrets of britain's atomic bomb
that is ridiculous he said in 1990 he offers no substantiation for that it's simply because i had access to some by no means all of the documents which he has mentioned
others in the spy ring were guy burgess kim philby and donald maclean who had worked in britain's foreign office and the foreign and domestic intelligence agencies before they were unmasked the fifth was anthony blunt a former diplomat and art adviser to queen elizabeth ii
the crown jewels is to be released in britain on april 6 and about the same time in russia interfax said

dear sara i have been corresponding with my pen-pal for five years a year ago i developed some feelings for him - the kind that is very different from what i feel for my other pen-pals
i feel happy whenever he calls or when i receive his letters i think he likes me too but i'm not sure how much he had asked me out once but i rejected him because i'm not pretty and quite big-sized he does not know it
is is possible to be in love with someone you have never met before
i like him very much - not because of his voice but because of his personality he is thoughtful but what if i'm wrong
he's in university at another state while i'm in a college in our hometown what if he changes his mind when he sees me is appearance so important should i keep my feelings in my heart as a hidden treasure or let it all out to a trusted friend to help me feel better
dear lily do you really need a trusted friend or any other just to help you feel good can you not just say this is for me it's going to make me feel good - so i'm just going to do it for me and even if it doesn't turn out okay
i felt good about it and i've learned something positive about myself and others my point here is to have more faith in yourself
you've already put a stamp on yourself saying rejected due to defects' before you've even given him the chance to make up his own mind
if you really like him at least give it a try before you write yourself off he might even turn out to be a jerk and you will have a good laugh wondering why you wasted so much time agonising over him
on the other hand things might just click and you can go on from there discovering more about each other and allowing things to develop naturally to a mutual level of affection and genuine regard
but nothing's going to happen if you keep him as a hidden treasure' to be cherished and fantasised over life is out there among the living so why call yourself a loser before you've even started
people who have the capacity for genuine affection will always look beyond the superficial which includes physical attributes
be the best you can be and bring that part of you into any friendship and you will have the courage and sense of self-worth to help you go out and meet the world head-on
if you like him go and find out more so give yourself a break and take a chance life is to be lived fully with all its ups and downs tears and joys and until you start to do so how can you hope to find someone who can offer you depth and substance in a fulfilled happiness good luck

slowed by age and infirmity pope john paul ii faces the rigors of air travel and tropical heat during a grueling much-anticipated trip to cuba next week
a sudden spell of weakness 10 days before his departure underlined worries about the 77-year-old pope's health leading a baptismal service sunday in the sistine chapel john paul lurched forward and was immediately supported by one of his assistants
the vatican denied an italian news report that the pope suffered a dizzy spell but officials no longer minimize his frailty
he hobbles sometimes he has to lean on his staff said papal spokesman joaquin navarro-valls adding that john paul has walked with difficulty since undergoing hip replacement surgery after a fall in his bathroom in 1994
the historic trip to cuba _ the pope's first _ carries much weight for john paul offering him a chance to enhance the roman catholic church's profile there after nearly four decades under communism
he faces a taxing schedule
in addition to the transatlantic flights he will travel by air to the cuban interior on three consecutive days returning to havana each evening he will deliver about two speeches a day meet with his clergy and try to mingle with the faithful if recent trips are any guide
a native of poland the pontiff has never fared well in tropical heat during a 1995 visit to sri lanka the pope made an unscheduled stop to change clothes when he became bathed in sweat in a non-air conditioned car
john paul has a long history of medical problems dating to 1981 when a would-be assassin shot him in the stomach
in 1992 doctors removed what the vatican said was a benign colon tumor the pope was last hospitalized in 1996 for an operation to remove an inflamed appendix
in addition slurred speech and a tremble in john paul's left hand are possible symptoms of parkinson's disease
although the vatican has never confirmed the pope suffers from that ailment it has acknowledged that the pope may have an extra pyramidal syndrome _ which could be one of many problems including parkinson's extra pyramidal refers to the part of the motor system that controls non-voluntary movement
still john paul keeps bouncing back
during a jan 3 visit to italian earthquake victims in assisi franciscan monks said the pope running late skipped the rest period set aside for him he then ate a hearty lunch of cured beef and parmesan cheese pasta and braised veal washed down with umbrian wine
as often happens when he is outside the vatican the much-traveled pope appeared in high spirits turning down a limousine ride to walk through the crowds
and he recovered quickly after sunday's spell appearing strong as he led the nearly two-hour mass and service where he baptized 19 babies
michelle kwan tara lipinski and todd eldredge flashed what looked like olympic medal-winning form at the us championships now the top europeans get their chance to impress
philippe candeloro viacheslav zagorodniuk irina slutskaya and others are looking to the european figure skating championships for the kind of boost their american rivals picked up last week
competition opens tuesday with the ice dancing compulsories in the morning and the pairs short program at night the men's short program is wednesday while the women get underway friday
kwan and co sparkled at last week's us nationals bringing predictions of a big medal haul for the americans at next month's winter olympics in nagano japan kwan was especially impressive receiving a record eight perfect 60s in her long program
the spotlight now falls on the europeans
while some nations have already selected their teams _ notably france with candeloro a legitimate medal contender _ many will do so based on results this week
there's hot competition among the powerful russian men where alexei urmanov may be forced to abdicate his 1994 olympic title urmanov who is also the defending european champion has been out since the world championships in march with a nagging groin injury
because he pulled out after the short program at the worlds russia gets just two olympic spots instead of three
urmanov must be considered a real longshot for nagano leaving three countrymen in the running ilia kulik 1995 world junior champion alexei yagudin and yevgeny plushenko
kulik served notice he's one to watch by upsetting world champion elvis stojko of canada and eldredge at the champions series final in munich germany last month
but the russian the 1995 european champion withdrew last week citing a nagging back injury while if fit he could still get picked for nagano kulik's absence gives the others particularly yagudin an edge
candeloro second to urmanov last year and ukraine's zagorodniuk the 1996 champion and third in 1997 figure to battle the russians for medals here

the federal government should be completely open about the risks of shipping nuclear waste across the country cleveland mayor michael r white said thursday
the us department of energy has a hearing scheduled friday in cleveland to hear from residents concerned about a proposal that could mean the shipment of waste from nuclear power plants through the cleveland area toward a proposed dump in nevada
i urge the department of energy to do everything in its power to ensure that clevelanders receive accurate and complete information white said at a news conference
the government has proposed storing waste from the nation's nuclear power plants at an underground dump at yucca mountain nev about 100 miles northwest of las vegas
gayle fisher spokeswoman for the department of energy's yucca mountain project office said friday's hearing will be the 19th of 20 scheduled during a six-month comment period ten hearings have been held in nevada
we're still studying the site and the routes even if everything were approved we would not be starting until 2010 ms fisher said
the latest round of public hearings began monday in lincoln neb and another hearing is scheduled tuesday in chicago
like cleveland lincoln and chicago sit along the main rail and highway routes connecting the east coast to nevada
the nevada destination makes ohio an obvious transit point because of its location between the east coast and midwest highway connections to nevada said robert j halstead of the nevada agency for nuclear projects cleveland's position at the juncture of rail routes from buffalo ny and harrisburg pa makes it a similar focal point for rail shipments he said
steve lesser an official at the public utilities commission of ohio who helped prepare testimony for the hearing said it is too early to tell how much waste would move through ohio and for how long
president clinton urged states thursday to issue photo id licenses for handgun purchases much like licenses for driving or hunting
the proposal was the last from clinton's state of the union agenda that was not revealed in advance of thursday's speech
under clinton's plan anyone who wants to buy a handgun would be required to first obtain a license showing he has passed a background check and a gun safety requirement such as a training course or an exam
states could choose not to participate in the program according to a white house official who discussed the proposal on condition of anonymity in states that decline to set up the licensing system a federally approved gun dealer or a federal entity would issue the license the official said
we are not mandating this the official said
tighter gun control already has emerged as an issue in the presidential campaign
vice president al gore has called for mandatory photo id licenses for handgun buyers he would require manufacturers and federally licensed sellers to report gun sales to state authority further gore would ban so-called saturday night specials and expand background checks and mandate child-safety locks
former sen bill bradley gore's rival for the democratic presidential nomination has urged mandatory licenses for handgun buyers and gun registration he also would raise license fees on dealers and ban saturday night specials
on the republican side texas gov george w bush has called for raising the age for handgun purchases to 21 he also supports instant background checks at gun shows bush opposes universal gun registration
steve forbes says he would let states set firearm standards
could an experimental hypertension drug keep senior citizens with a common but rarely treated type of borderline high blood pressure from dying or having a heart attack stroke or heart failure
scientists in 16 countries led by a cardiologist at the university of medicine and dentistry of new jersey have begun a mammoth five-year study to find the answer they are hoping the medication will prevent patients' arteries from stiffening further and thus pushing their blood pressure dangerously high
the study begun last fall will include about 12600 patients at about 900 sites around the world according to the lead researcher dr john d kostis a cardiology professor and chairman of the department of medicine at umdnj-robert wood johnson medical school in new brunswick
it is a history-making clinical trial kostis said thursday
the study will test a bristol-myers squibb co drug called omapatrilat on patients who have an early stage of what's called isolated systolic hypertension because only their systolic blood pressure is above normal
systolic pressure the top number in a blood pressure reading occurs when the heart contracts forcing blood into the arteries diastolic pressure the lower number in a blood pressure reading occurs when the heart relaxes between beats usually if one pressure is elevated the other is high as well
from the 1950s until the 1990s cardiologists and researchers focused on patients' diastolic pressure partly because the heart is at rest two-thirds of the time efforts to control hypertension concentrated on bringing down patients' diastolic pressure until studies by kostis and other researchers in the late 1990s showed that using diuretics prevented cardiac events such as heart attacks in many patients
kostis said those studies showed that the level of a patient's systolic pressure was a better predictor than diastolic pressure of whether their heart condition would worsen or kill them
there is no proof that treating the mildest forms of this isolated systolic hypertension benefits the patient but this study could prove just that said kostis who spent a decade trying to organize and get funding for it
bristol-myers squibb which has its research headquarters in princeton is funding the study it is hoping the federal food and drug administration which earlier this month said it would expedite its evaluation of the drug will approve it for sale by june
half the patients will take a 20 mg or 40 mg dose of omapatrilat each day and half will take a sugar pill neither the patients nor their doctors will know who got what until the study ends patients must be 65 or older and have a systolic blood pressure of 141 to 159 and a diastolic pressure below 90
i think they're doing a great thing for whoever might need it said alfred feld 72 of old bridge one of the first patients recruited
feld a retired salesman and manager in the textile industry has had borderline high blood pressure for years but is always on the go with errands and civic activities he doesn't want his heart condition to worsen and force him to slow down
i'm thrilled to be getting it he said while feld doesn't know if he's actually taking the drug he said his blood pressure was fine at his annual physical last week
dr jeffrey cutler head of clinical hypertension trials at the national heart lung and blood institute said given that several million elderly americans have isolated systolic hypertension and there have been no large studies of whether cutting their blood pressure is beneficial it's an important thing to nail down
worldwide 15 percent to 20 percent of people over age 60 have the condition
a positive result from such a trial could have important influences on practice patterns cutler said adding that he would have preferred to see the study also compare omapatrilat to the most commonly used heart drugs
omapatrilat which has the brand name vanlev belongs to a new class of cardiovascular drugs known as vasopeptidase inhibitors and could become the first in that class to go on sale
like other cardiac drugs called ace inhibitors vasopeptidase inhibitors block the effects of certain enzymes that constrict arteries and thicken the walls of arteries and the heart itself pushing up blood pressure kostis said the drug also blocks effects of another type of enzyme that also narrows blood vessels while at the same time increasing levels of a chemical that dilates those vessels and flushing excess pressure-raising fluids from the bloodstream
it's uniquely suited for this kind of blood pressure because it appears to lower systolic blood pressure more than other drugs he said
editor's note patients interested in participating in the study should call 732-235-6546 or 732-235-7871
republicans responding to president clinton's state of the union address thursday argued they have proposed bigger tax cuts and better approaches to improving health care and education
like the president first-term sens susan collins of maine and bill frist of tennessee said their party stands for protecting social security extending health insurance to more americans eliminating the national debt and ensuring that medicare beneficiaries have access to prescription drugs
but these goals must be accomplished without an explosion of federal spending and new bureaucracies they said mr president please no more red tape frist said
collins and frist two 47-year-old pragmatists known for working well with democrats both cited personal experiences in promoting the gop way
frist a heart-lung transplant surgeon recalled working in england for the british national health service and seeing firsthand the rationing the lack of choice the long waits and the denial of care for seniors
he said clinton's health care proposals including his ambitious plan to extend coverage to the parents of children protected by the children's health insurance program were just as bad as his 1993 attempt to create a universal health care program
the children's program lets states offer medicaid or other insurance to children in low-income working families who are not poor enough to qualify for traditional medicaid
republicans frist said would work to reform medicare pass a patients' rights bill that makes lawsuits against hmos a last resort and ensure that americans have choice and security in their health care alternatives
collins a former college administrator repeated the republican principle that better education must come through more local control the debate in washington is not about money it's about who makes the decisions she said
collins said republicans will continue to increase federal funds for elementary and secondary education but local schools and communities should decide how to spend the money she said republicans also will increase federal grants for use in teacher recruiting and training and will promote education savings accounts so parents better can save money for their children's education
collins touched briefly on other republican goals - cutting taxes such as the estate death tax eliminating the $36 trillion public debt in the next 15 years and building a national missile defense system
other republicans were more blunt in their criticism of clinton's proposed new spending part of bill clinton's legacy will be the notion that santa claus comes to town at the end of january instead of december said florida rep tillie fowler a member of the house gop leadership he has presented his list of goodies aimed at pleasing every constituency
as washington digs out of the latest winter blizzard the congress will dig out of an avalanche of presidential spending initiatives said house speaker dennis hastert r-ill
hastert earlier thursday also spoke of a republican plan to improve prescription drug coverage for the elderly
unlike clinton who has proposed creating a new medicare prescription drug plan open to all hastert said the gop would focus on helping the one-third of senior citizens who now lack access to or cannot afford private options tax credits and block grants to states were among the options he said
smoking among high schoolers dropped in 1999 for the first time since the government began keeping track at the start of the decade but nearly one in 10 children have already smoked cigarettes by middle school
a nationwide survey of 7529 high schoolers in september and october found that 284 percent reported using tobacco products in the preceding month the centers for disease control and prevention said thursday
in 1997 the last time the cdc looked at high school smoking 364 percent of students said they had smoked in the preceding month at the time teen smoking was on the rise from 348 percent in 1995 and 275 percent in 1991 the first year the cdc started keeping track
the cdc said it expected teen smoking rates to drop - just not by so much the agency said differences between the 1999 survey and earlier studies may have exaggerated the decline
we may have peaked in terms of smoking rates among high school students said michael eriksen director of the cdc's office on smoking and health
the drop in smoking rates had been expected because tobacco companies raised cigarette prices about 45 cents a pack last year to help pay for the $206 billion national settlement
as part of the settlement billboard ads for cigarettes were banned and the tobacco industry was barred from running advertisements with cartoon characters such as joe camel that anti-smoking activists say are aimed at youngsters in many places cigarette billboards have been replaced by signs with anti-smoking messages
for the first time ever the cdc also surveyed middle school students about smoking questioning about as many middle-schoolers as high school students
nine percent of the students in grades six through eight said they had smoked cigarettes nearly 13 percent said they had used some tobacco product - including chewing tobacco pipes and cigars
i don't think it was that surprising because we see such high rates in high school that we know it begins in middle school we just didn't know at what level eriksen said
ron todd director of tobacco control for the american cancer society agreed that higher cigarette prices should result in fewer smokers of high school age but he said the cdc's numbers surprised him
i wouldn't expect a decline that dramatic todd said we'll have to continually monitor it to get a better picture of what's really going on
the questions used in the surveys and the one in 1997 were the same said wick warren a cdc statistician but response rates varied about 90 percent of schools responded to the 1999 tobacco survey the earlier surveys which also included questions about sex got responses from about 75 percent of schools
the study also found that the wide gap in smoking rates between white and black high school students does not exist among middle-schoolers
the proportion of blacks smoking in high school was nearly 16 percent - half the percentage of white smokers but in middle school both racial groups were about 9 percent
though it is too soon to tell this could signal the end of a 25-year trend in which blacks started smoking later than whites
two trendy types of imported cigarettes - bidis and kreteks - are being smoked by about 5 percent of high schoolers and 2 percent of middle-schoolers that makes them almost as popular as chewing tobacco
bidis are skinny unfiltered indian cigarettes that come in flavors such as vanilla kreteks are a kind of clove cigarette
a former rwandan tea factory manager was convicted thursday by a un tribunal for three genocide-related charges including raping a tutsi woman and encouraging four of his employees to rape her as well
alfred musema was the second defendant to come before the international criminal tribunal for rwanda to be convicted of rape
his was the seventh verdict handed down by the tribunal which was created in 1994 to prosecute chief architects and perpetrators of the 1994 genocide of more than 500000 minority tutsis and politically moderate hutus
musema is the first private citizen tried and convicted by the tribunal the others were soldiers or government officials he was sentenced to life in prison
the 50-year-old musema looked down when the judges announced his sentence the maximum allowed under court rules
musema personally led attackers to attack large numbers of tutsi refugees and raped a young tutsi woman he knowingly and consciously participated in the commission of crimes and never showed remorse for his personal role in the commission of the atrocities said presiding judge lennart aspegren of sweden
the three-judge panel found musema guilty on one count each of rape genocide and crimes against humanity it acquitted him on six other genocide-related counts
his attorney steven kay of britain said afterward he would appeal
the court said musema former director of the state-owned tea factory in gisovu in western rwanda's kibuye province was guilty of raping the woman and encouraging his employees to as well another witness at the trial testified that musema had disemboweled a pregnant woman saying he wanted to find out what the inside of a tutsi woman looks like
the rwandan genocide was unleashed by an extremist hutu government bent on exterminating rwanda's minority tutsis the slaughter was led by rwanda's then-hutu army and hutu militiamen
musema's rape conviction goes to show the resolve of the judges of the tribunal to address the issue of rape said tribunal spokesman kingsley moghalu rape was pervasive during the genocide in 1994
in a precedent-setting ruling the court ruled in 1998 that prosecutors could issue indictments for rape because sexual assault was aimed at exterminating tutsis
musema also was convicted of crimes against humanity for allowing workers at the tea factory to participate in massacres and use the factory grounds for the task the ruling said
during the trial musema denied charges he had led massacres of tutsis who were attempting to defend themselves at bisesero hill in kibuye during the genocide but the judges dismissed most alibis offered by witnesses called to testify on his behalf
the trial was the swiftest since formal court proceedings got under way at the international court in january 1997 amendments to court procedures last year have sped up the trials
the tribunal which has 39 people in custody in the northern tanzanian town of arusha handed down its first convictions in september 1999 musema was arrested in switzerland on feb 11 1995 and was later transferred to the tribunal
john wayne bobbitt who made national headlines after his then-wife lorena bobbitt cut off his penis in 1993 was found guilty of harassment wednesday
bobbitt 32 was sentenced to time served for the nov 2 altercation with a former girlfriend adult film star desiree a luz he was jailed 17 days before posting the $50000 bond the court also ordered him to not contact or communicate with ms luz
i was innocent said bobbitt outside the courthouse i wasn't prepared for the defense and i was innocent
bobbitt's ex-wife was found innocent by reason of insanity after she argued she cut off her husband's penis because he was abusive
after surgery reattached his penis bobbitt made a number of adult films and worked in a nevada brothel in north tonawanda he had worked as a bartender and tow truck operator
the florida supreme court struck down part of a state law that gives grandparents the right to seek court-ordered time with their grandchildren the third time the court has said the state cannot overrule a parent in the matter
the ruling concerned a provision that gave grandparents greater rights of visitation if the child is born out of wedlock
as with two other provisions of the law it has struck down the court ruled the out of wedlock condition unconstitutionally violates the right of the parents to raise their children as they see fit without interference
the only two remaining provisions of the law allow grandparents to seek court-ordered visitation when the parents of their grandchildren have divorced or deserted the child
thursday's unanimous decision stemmed from a palm beach county dispute involving the 5-year-old son of dominick brunetti and beth saul their son tyler lived with his mother and her parents until she was killed in a car accident when tyler then moved in with his father the mother's parents sought the right to see him and a judge awarded them weekly visits
all 50 states have laws allowing grandparents and others to seek visitation after divorces or under other circumstances the us supreme court in a challenge to a washington state law is looking at the conflict between a state's desire to promote children's best interests and parents' right to raise their children free from government interference
visitation laws have been struck down or sharply narrowed in a few other states including georgia and tennessee but generally have survived court challenges
elian gonzalez's father told us immigration officials that his miami relatives offered him millions of dollars a house and a car to join the 6-year-old boy in the united states according to court papers filed thursday
i could go there with all my family and would be taken care and could have a job if i wanted to work but with the money offered i would not need to do so the father said that's when i hung up the telephone
the us government filed the papers in response to a lawsuit filed by the boy's miami relatives who are challenging an order that elian be sent back to live with his father in cuba
in its 400-page response the government argued that the federal courts have no right to intervene and that allowing elian to stay could seriously prejudice the ability of the us government to help parents in the united states recover their children taken to foreign countries
the motion quoted a statement by a state department official who said people who abduct their children to islamic countries often argue that the social environment in the united states is unsuitable for children failing to send elian back to cuba could make those arguments more acceptable to foreign authorities the government said
the next hearing in the case is set for the week of march 6 although the judge in the case could issue a ruling sooner
the dispute over elian's fate began two months ago after he was found clinging to an inner tube in the atlantic his mother and 10 other people fleeing cuba for florida died after their boat capsized
the boy's cuban grandmothers have been in the united states for the past week to appeal for his return they had a tearful tense reunion with the boy in florida on wednesday and on thursday they renewed their efforts on capitol hill
the court papers reflect some of the dominant themes of the debate the families in cuba and florida each say the other side is lying and being manipulated by political forces
lazaro gonzalez a great-uncle who has temporary custody of the boy in miami told immigration officials that he spoke to elian's father by telephone two or three days before the boy was even found lazaro gonzalez said elian's father asked him to protect elian by whatever means available but eventually changed his tune and asked for elian to come back
we all think he's under pressure from the government because of his change in sentiment and i'm amazed about this lazaro gonzalez said
elian's father juan miguel gonzalez was interviewed by immigration and naturalization service officials in havana on dec 13 and 31
in those interviews the boy's father said his relatives in miami offered him $2 million a house and a car if he would join his son in the united states he also said a church had offered $4 million to elian so he would be set for life he did not specify which church made the offer
elian's cousin marisleysis gonzalez denied the accusations
never did we offer him money she said we would never buy our family we would never buy anybody because we are the type of family that believes money can't buy people
silma dimmel the ins official who conducted the interview said in a statement that elian's father did not appear at all nervous or intimidated and based on his demeanor i had no reason to believe he was being coerced
elian's father checked no on a questionnaire asking him whether he wanted the boy to stay in the united states whether he was being coerced and whether he had ever requested a visa to travel to the united states
according to the court papers ins officials asked these questions in written form in case the room was bugged
in his account elian's father claims that his ex-wife elisabeth brotons took the boy out of cuba without telling him after the boy turned up in the united states at all times i asked that elian be returned to me his father said
elian's father also complained that the relatives in miami had interfered with his attempts to speak with his son on the phone
when we call and elian starts saying grandma i want to be with you' or daddy i want to go with you' they immediately make him cry or give him a candy or start tapping on the lines saying that the lines are getting bad and hang up the phone he said
marisleysis gonzalez told the ins that the boy's father was being pressured by the communist government
his tone of voice is different like people telling him what to say she said the phone sounds like it's being tapped
the father told reporters in cuba on thursday that he was furious with the way the grandmothers were treated during their reunion with the child gonzalez complained that the grandmothers' cellular phones were confiscated making it impossible for him to speak with his boy out of the presence of the miami relatives
i felt very indignant gonzalez said they just ruined everything

house speaker dennis hastert invited an illinois-area cardinal to the address as his guest amid a controversy over the rejection of a roman catholic priest to be the house's new chaplain
hastert denied to reporters earlier thursday that cardinal francis george of chicago was in attendance to quell criticism from catholics cardinal george is a friend of mine he said
the speaker said he was not sure if the cardinal was invited before or after a brouhaha erupted last month over the rejection of the rev timothy o'brien a catholic priest from wisconsin as the house chaplain
catholics and democrats have charged that hastert r-ill and majority leader dick armey r-texas chose the rev charles parker wright a presbyterian minister despite the preference of a bipartisan selection committee for o'brien the house has never had a catholic chaplain a post that pays $132100 a year
a key witness in a 1973 murder trial testified thursday that a police detective terrorized him into lying on the stand at one point spinning the barrel of his gun as they sat in a jail cell
wayne wright was one of two teen-age runaways whose testimony helped convict two prostitutes for the murder of timothy haworth 52 a philadelphia businessman who was battered and strangled in a rochester alley in 1973
at the retrial of john duval whose conviction was overturned last spring after he'd spent 25 years in prison wright maintained that chief detective william mahoney had beaten him in custody and threatened to charge him with murder if he didn't testify against duval
a day before he was to appear in court wright who was held in jail as a material witness said the detective nudged him awake in a jail cell and pulled out his revolver
he was just sitting there spinning the barrel of his revolver and asking if you know what you're going to say on the stand wright said
i got up on the stand and regurgitated what they fed into me he added
he retracted his testimony in 1997
the convictions were overturned a few months later after prosecutors came upon a buried synopsis of a police interview with the other teen jon jackson in which he denied seeing duval or tyson with the victim - contrary to what the teens had testified at trial wright also says he never saw them together
duval and fellow prostitute betty tyson got 25 years to life imprisonment in the absence of physical evidence they were convicted of murder on the basis of confessions they insist were beaten out of them by mahoney and on the testimony of the two teens
prosecutors decided not to retry tyson - the city gave her $12 million in compensation - but went after duval again while tyson had steadfastly maintained her innocence duval had twice admitted his guilt before a parole board he says he lied because he didn't think he would be freed until he admitted guilt
mahoney who was investigated at least 10 times for allegedly abusing suspects resigned in 1980 after he was convicted of fabricating evidence in an unrelated case he died in 1981
washington ap president clinton proposed a $350 billion tax cut big spending increases for schools and health care and photo id licenses for handgun purchases thursday as he offered the final agenda of his presidency the state of our union is the strongest it has ever been he declared
clinton issued a stinging rebuke to an election-year congress as he delivered his last state of the union address for too long this congress has been standing still on some of our most pressing national priorities he chided
the president noted that next month the united states will achieve the longest period of economic growth in the nation's history and called on americans to set great goals
the president offered a long litany of initiatives many of them sure to be rewritten or ignored by congress his tax cut proposals were intended primarily to promote educational opportunities and expand health insurance and child care for lower- and middle-income americans the initiatives included relief from the marriage penalty - an idea first championed by republicans - and a new program of retirement savings accounts
most of the proposals were released in advance but the white house withheld clinton's gun licensing measure until the last minute to build suspense similar to a plan offered by vice president al gore it would require handgun purchasers to first obtain a state license showing they have passed a background check and a gun safety requirement such as a training course or an exam
states could choose not to participate in the program the national rifle association condemned the plan as pointless and unworkable
clinton was greeted by applause and handshakes by republicans and democrats alike he called for passage of a patients' bill of rights to strengthen consumer protection gun-safety legislation campaign finance reform an increase in the minimum wage and votes on long-stalled judicial nominations
republicans ridiculed clinton's proposals but did not rule out working with him on such issues as education and health care if we enacted all the new programs the president has talked about we'd spend just about the entire surplus on bigger and more expensive government said house speaker dennis hastert r-ill
five days before the new hampshire primary clinton seized the chance to boost gore in his race for the democratic presidential nomination in his prepared text there were six references to the vice president clinton also recognized another candidate his wife hillary rodham clinton running for the us senate seat in new york
many of clinton's proposals were repackaged from earlier years and in some cases resubmitted with spending figures double or triple the original amount
clinton boasted that the nation has been lifted from economic distress social decline and political gridlock
we begin the new century with over 20 million new jobs the fastest economic growth in more than 30 years the lowest unemployment rates in 30 years the lowest poverty rates in 20 years the lowest african-american and hispanic unemployment rates on record the first back-to-back surpluses in 42 years
in offering his gun licensing plan clinton said we've all seen what happens when guns fall into the wrong hands the president said his words recalled the tragedy of the massacre at columbine high school tom mauser the father of slain student daniel mauser was among those invited to listen to clinton's speech in a vip box with the first lady
the president boasted of the nation's upbeat times
never before has our nation enjoyed at once so much prosperity and social progress with so little internal crisis or so few external threats the president said never before have we had such a blessed opportunity - and therefore such a profound obligation - to build the more perfect union of our founders' dreams
clinton's tax program includes marriage penalty relief tax deductions of up to $2800 annually per family for college tuition and fees and retirement savings accounts for low- and moderate-income families he also proposed steps to encourage charitable giving
the president's tax package joined a mix of proposals urged by republicans and democrats as both sides battle for control of congress and the white house smarting from clinton's veto of their $792 billion tax-cut package last year house republicans are drafting their own version of educational tax breaks and marriage penalty relief this year presidential candidates have their own proposals too
rep bill archer r-texas chairman of the ways and means committee called clinton's tax cuts too limited we think all americans deserve tax relief not just the handful the president picks archer said
the president's tax package would cost $350 billion over 10 years however his plan envisions cutting that price tag by $100 billion by closing tax havens shelters and loopholes congress has previously rejected many of those ideas on grounds they are tax increases
there were no major foreign policy announcements although clinton urged congress to give china permanent normal trading relations with the united states he also asked for $16 billion for colombia to fight narco-traffickers
while urging higher spending and targeted tax cuts clinton said we must not forsake the path of fiscal discipline that got us here we must make these investments and tax cuts only in the context of a balanced budget that strengthens and extends the life of social security and pays down the national debt
the booming economy and swelling tax revenues give clinton and republicans a big purse for any tax reductions or spending increases both sides claim they are dedicated to protecting social security and eliminating the national debt
clinton also
called anew for medicare to include a prescription drug benefit and to let people as young as 55 buy medicare coverage - this time with a 25 percent tax credit
proposed $1 billion in tax incentives for drug makers to develop vaccines for malaria tuberculosis and hiv/aids
called for doubling spending for after-school and summer school programs and to expand the head start program for needy children to cover 950000 kids
offered tax breaks for college costing $30 billion over 10 years
expanded the earned income tax credit for the working poor by $21 billion and offered a tax credit for long-term care costing $27 billion
proposed a 10-year $110 billion proposal to provide health coverage to the parents of children protected by the state children's health insurance program if approved it would be the largest increase in health coverage in 35 years
much of the nation saw snow - and braced for even more - while still digging out and trying to return to normal thursday after the wintry punch that caught so many people flat-footed earlier this week
a strong disturbance caused snow from the texas panhandle and oklahoma into louisiana arkansas and mississippi
in oklahoma schools were closed statewide meetings postponed and state employees excused from work some courts also shut down so workers could stay safe at home
forecasters called for more snow in central oklahoma - as much as 10 to 14 inches - and said some roads could become nearly impassable
slipping and sliding arkansas residents abandoned their jobs by the thousands and tried to make it home as up to 15 inches of snow fell
at one time it was coming so thick it looked like the world ended 200 yards from the windows said pati brown the manager of the mountain harbor resort in mount ida ark
many schools and businesses were closed and tens of thousands remained without electricity thursday throughout the carolinas texas and florida
alabama residents stripped store shelves bare closed schools and generally hunkered down while freezing rain sleet and snow interrupted hundreds of airline flights snarled highway traffic and cut power to thousands of homes across north and central texas
baltimore announced that it already had exhausted its annual snow removal budget as of thursday half of the maryland's school districts remained closed and commuters cursed snow-narrowed streets as traffic crawled
georgia residents as far south as albany and columbus were nervously awaiting more snow sleet and freezing rain that were predicted - with images of last week's ice-covered roads and darkened houses in the atlanta area still fresh on their minds
last weekend's storm in north georgia left 500000 customers without electricity and caused an estimated $44 million in damage the coming storm is expected to cover a much greater area and dump even more precipitation
emboldened by sunshine and improving roads north carolinians dug out their cars and began replenishing empty pantries still amazed by the 2-foot snowstorm
making her first grocery shopping foray since monday night's storm ann long recalled how the falling snow looked beautiful at first
but then it started to look a little like a monster and i thought it's amazing how fast something that is so pretty can turn into something so ugly
the mississippi emergency management agency on standdown since the y2k threat fizzled was up and running to respond to emergencies the rest of the state was shutting down including schools and colleges local governments and businesses
even in florida winter's reach matched its grasp
the chilly weather kept beachgoers out of the surf at daytona beach and the volusia county beach patrol sent home its part-time lifeguards because there weren't enough swimmers
a judge has ordered attorneys not to comment on any aspect of the case of a 13-year-old boy accused of shooting four students outside his middle school
associate district judge tom alford put a gag order on the attorneys during a closed hearing thursday that was called to determine whether there is enough evidence to prosecute the boy
the boy has pleaded innocent in an attempt to avoid being prosecuted as an adult attorney jim wilcoxen has said
he has been held since dec 6 when four students were wounded outside fort gibson middle school in eastern oklahoma a fifth student was injured by a bullet that ricocheted
vice president al gore has closed the gap against george w bush in a potential presidential matchup says a national poll released thursday - 10 months ahead of the november election
the nbc-wall street journal poll also found a majority of americans happy with the direction of the country and two-thirds gave president clinton high job approval marks said the poll made public on the day of clinton's final state of the union address
the national poll showed republican front-runner bush at 47 percent and democratic front-runner gore at 44 percent gore had trailed the republican in head-to-head matchups throughout 1999 the poll of 1010 american adults taken jan 25-26 had a 3 percentage point error margin larger for subgroups
when reform party candidate pat buchanan was included in the general election matchup both gore and bush were at 43 percent and buchanan was at 5 percent
in december bush led by 50 percent to 39 percent and has maintained an average double-digit lead over gore in the poll throughout 1999
bush had an 8-point lead over former sen bill bradley gore's rival in a head-to-head matchup in the latest poll in polls late last year bradley usually performed better against bush than gore did largely because of bradley's appeal to independents
gore's problem in 1999 was consolidating democrats said fred yang a partner in one of the firms that conducted the poll peter d hart research associates as a result of iowa he has quickly been able to consolidate his democratic support
gore leads bradley in polling for the new hampshire primary next tuesday sen john mccain and bush are locked in a tough battle there with mccain leading in some polls and tied with bush in others
the differences since december in the poll by democratic pollster hart and republican pollster bob teeter were likely the result of gore's performance in the weeks leading up to his victory in the iowa caucuses monday night yang said citing other polling data on gore in the last couple of weeks
this is clearly a good poll for gore but it's not a bad poll for bush his numbers still hold up very well said yang noting the public still has a positive view of bush
teeter said the poll indicated you've got a country that is happy affluent and thinks things are going pretty well
he said bush remains very popular with the public and he saw the closing of the gap as natural as the race takes shape
we can't tell if gore is getting a blip because he's been in the public a lot and beaten bradley and we'll see that go back down teeter said noting that bush still had a 14-point lead among independent voters
gore led bradley 64 percent to 22 percent compared with a 54 percent-to-32 percent gore lead in the december poll bush led mccain nationally 63 percent to 15 percent in the new poll about the same margin as in december
when americans were asked whether they wanted a presidential candidate whose views were more liberal more conservative or the same as clinton's 50 percent said about the same 37 percent said more conservative and 8 percent said more liberal
the united states has balked at a un plan to dramatically speed up the delivery of humanitarian supplies to iraq - despite having pledged to try to get more goods to iraqis in a resolution last month diplomats said thursday
the united states voted for the dec 17 resolution which not only created a new un weapons inspection agency for iraq but also outlined ways to improve the un humanitarian program in the country
iraq has been unable to sell its oil on the open market since sanctions were imposed after its 1990 invasion of kuwait the security council launched the un oil-for-food program in 1996 to allow iraq to export limited amounts of oil to buy humanitarian goods for its people
food and medicine funded through the program are already approved within two working days but large contracts for other items considered to be of a humanitarian nature including goods to improve iraq's agriculture electric and public works sectors take as long as a week to process
in the dec 17 resolution the security council said it would act on contracts for humanitarian and other essential civilian goods within a target of two working days
but washington balked wednesday when the head of the iraq program benon sevan announced at a sanctions committee meeting that his office would start submitting contracts for approval within two days beginning feb 1 diplomats said
us officials said they needed more than two days to review the contracts to prevent items with a potential military use from slipping through the multibillion dollar program
a state department official speaking thursday on condition of anonymity said the united states would start putting humanitarian contracts on hold if the two-day rule is applied
if you make it every case has to be dealt with in two working days then you'll find that we're putting 95 percent of all cases on hold said the official and they'll stay on hold until we finish
diplomats said the issue concerned different interpretations of what within a target of two working days actually meant with the united states saying that language in the resolution may be the goal for approval but not necessarily the deadline
the united states leads all 15 nations on the security council in placing contracts for supplies on hold currently blocking $13 billion worth of contracts

house speaker dennis hastert invited an illinois-area cardinal to the address as his guest amid a controversy over the rejection of a roman catholic priest to be the house's new chaplain

human rights groups are protesting the appointment of a general they say oversaw the slaying of a french nurse and four others during el salvador's civil war
the national center for the promotion of human rights has continually asserted that on april 15 1989 gustavo adolfo perdomo ordered his men to execute madeleine lagadec and four other people at a rural hospital in el salvador's tortugal region of the central san vicente province
perdomo a lifelong military bureaucrat directed a special governmental battalion during the 12-year civil war during which government forces battled leftist insurgents
president francisco flores who recently promoted perdomo to general responded to the charges thursday saying that the french government has cleared the general of any wrongdoing and has not objected to his appointment
in 1994 a french judge requested that salvadoran authorities look into perdomo's involvement and that of another general in lagadec's death but the request was denied because the officers were protected by an amnesty that was part of the peace agreement signed in january 1992
flores did admit however that an unidentified french judge recently had contacted the salvadoran supreme court in hopes of having the court review the case but such a request violates international convention and can't be honored flores said
in france officials in the office of french judge renaud van ruymbecke said this week that the judge was ready to deploy a team of french investigators to el salvador to aid the supreme court in its review of the case
flores defended perdomo's record as a military leader saying there was never any credible evidence that he was responsible for the crime
but a 1989 report produced by the salvadoran truth commission implicates perdomo in the killings it details a military offensive known as operation lightning in which salvadoran soldiers followed up the bombing of the tortugal region by deploying specialized groups of troops including the one led by perdomo with orders to kill any wounded people they encountered
a group of foreign workers is suing three giant timber companies alleging they were underpaid after being recruited to come to the united states to plant trees
two of the suits were filed thursday and one wednesday in federal court
the workers mostly mexicans claim international paper georgia-pacific and champion international corp broke the rules of the federal program that allows them to use foreign labor by not paying the prevailing wage for the work
the plaintiffs also claim they haven't been paid overtime as required by federal law for the seasonal work they do mostly re-planting trees on the companies' lands in the southeastern united states
james knoepp an attorney with the migrant farmworker justice project in belle glade estimated as many as 6000 workers may be eligible to join the suit and said they would be seeking several million dollars in back pay
spokesmen for two of the companies said they hadn't seen the lawsuits and couldn't comment
of course we follow all regulations relative to labor practices said ken haldin a spokesman for atlanta-based georgia pacific
gov mike leavitt announced thursday he will run for a third term saying he wants to lead utah through the 2002 winter olympic games
the governor has spent much of the past year dealing with accusations that people who worked to bring the olympics to salt lake city had given gifts cash and scholarships to international olympic committee members and their families
on thursday he defended himself again against charges that his top aides knew about the scandal
the record is clear every time i had any credible evidence i acted to straighten it out said leavitt 48
if re-elected in november the republican governor would be only the second utah governor to serve a third term it would be his last four-year term under state term limits approved in 1995
no candidates have announced plans to challenge him
the state of the union and the state of al gore's campaign are so intertwined that the vice president has made sure one man has his fingerprints on both efforts
bob shrum who is traveling with gore in the final days of the new hampshire campaign helped write the address that dovetailed with gore's campaign proposals and gave him credit for administration achievements
so it was no surprise that the speech was peppered with half a dozen laudatory references to gore as in with the help of the vice president and i propose we follow vice president gore's suggestion clinton even borrowed from the vice president's campaign platform proposing photo ids for handgun purchases
if gore has his way he will benefit as much as clinton from the nationally televised address
i have fought alongside this president for the economy and for the other important things we have seen from the clinton-gore administration the vice president told new hampshire public radio hours later gore flew to washington to take his traditional state of the union perch behind clinton - looking down on congress applauding his boss and basking in the president's praise
shrum said that scene will help gore in his campaign against bill bradley the former new jersey senator rocked in the vice president's 2-to-1 victory in the iowa caucuses is struggling to stay close to the front-running gore in state polls
the vice president's there at the address he's doing his job people believe he has the experience and skills to keep the prosperity and the economy in good shape shrum said between campaign stops with the vice president any kind of visual confirmation will be very helpful
so helpful indeed that bradley's campaign has accused the white house of purposely scheduling the address five days before tuesday's election
al gore has been a loyal vice president but his loyalty hasn't translated into a bold vision for where we need to go into the next decade bradley spokesman eric hauser said as clinton delivered the address
shrum is a full-time campaign adviser and a part-time white house consultant putting him at the intersection of clinton's policies and gore's politics
the washington operative played down his role saying he hadn't been involved in the address in several days even then i didn't see my role as a representative of the vice president i was helping the president shrum said
still advisers say shrum and the vice president's west wing staff left their mark on the speech gore's chief of staff charles burson reviewed early drafts and attended rehearsals with the president and his staff
the address included new children's health care and technology programs that fit gore's campaign themes
in the runup to the speech clinton announced emergency subsidies for low-income families to pay heating bills in about a dozen states including $54 million for this state alone shortly before the iowa caucuses clinton gave his vice president credit for a new health care initiative
al gore is a big part of this presidency said clinton's chief of staff john podesta next week we'll have the biggest economic expansion in the nation's history al gore is a big part of that
this is the latest evolution of what gore himself called a complex relationship with clinton just as polls show most americans are torn between their approval of clinton's performance and their disappointment with his personal behavior gore seems to have wavered between embracing his boss and pushing him away
but the vice president says people oversimplify their relationship it's not true that i'm either distancing myself from him or that i'm trying to run as a derivative candidate gore told new hampshire public radio
analysts said gore can link himself to clinton this week because eight out of 10 new hampshire democrats approve of clinton's job performance even if his personal approval rating is much lower gore also stands to benefit from dramatic improvements in new hampshire's economy since the 1992 presidential campaign
i think as far as the primaries are concerned this is good for gore as long as the focus is on clinton's programs and not him personally said david rhode political science professor at michigan state university
other analysts said gore has already rounded up the pro-clinton vote thus the address won't pad his margin over bradley
everybody knows he's clinton's vice president so i don't think it adds much said democratic consultant jim duffy of washington but then again the timing can't hurt duffy added
the turkish military on thursday took delivery of two rebuilt f-4 warplanes part of an ambitious multi-billion dollar modernization program that foresees the country as a major regional power
the commander of the turkish military gen huseyin kivrikoglu pointed to instability in the nearby balkans and caucasus saying that such uncertainties require the turkish armed forces to be more powerful
the fighters were upgraded in israel and also highlight the growing military relationship between the two countries
turkey and israel aircraft industries are working together to upgrade 54 f-4es adding advanced radar and electronic warfare capabilities and strengthening the structures of the aircraft the project is expected to cost $700 million
twenty-six of the aircraft will be upgraded in israel the other 28 planes will be reworked in turkey by turkish workers using israeli technology
the new electronics are expected to extend the life of the aircraft which first entered service in the united states in the late 1960s and saw combat in vietnam until the year 2020
turkey is dramatically expanding the capabilities of its armed forces and is expected to spend some dlrs 150 billion over the next 25 years purchasing new tanks and helicopters and expanding its air force
although turkish relations with greece have improved in recent months turkey is wary of the growing iranian military and fears that syria and iraq could become threats in the future
the military expansion also comes as turkey embarks on a more outward looking foreign policy sending peacekeepers to the balkans and courting former soviet republics
turkey the former ottoman empire regards the balkans and the caucasus as its traditional sphere of influence
george w bush gained the endorsement of jack kemp a favorite of conservatives on thursday and said the republican party needs a presidential nominee who can debate the democrats not mimic them
he suggested that sen john mccain's tax proposals are too like president clinton's
mccain meanwhile said he'd devote a projected $1 trillion 10-year budget surplus bonus to paying off the national debt by 2013 instead of adding it to the proposed tax cut that bush says would be too little to protect against the spending habits of washington politicians
the arizona senator also said he'd be a better debater against vice president al gore because bush stands mute on campaign finance reform
it's much easier for me to attack clinton and gore because i have the high ground said mccain who is a strong advocate of campaign finance changes
he holds the edge over bush in polls of likely voters in the new hampshire presidential primary next tuesday but the texas governor said he has a good chance of winning and can withstand losing anyhow campaigning in nashua bush said he hopes new hampshire republicans will choose him as a candidate who can win who can unify the party
i think when the republicans go into the booths in new hampshire and around the country it's important to nominate somebody who will be able to debate the democratic nominee on key issues not mimic them bush said
in jaffrey bush stood in the front hall of a white brick colonial home built in 1830 and told townspeople he is a man on a mission to lift the spirit of america and to cut its taxes he said so that surplus funds won't be spent on a bigger more intrusive federal government
bush said a mccain remark in the wednesday night debate made his point when he said his tax plan was similar to president clinton's tax plan it made it real clear the difference of opinion on taxes bush said
what mccain said was that clinton had moved toward a plan like his not the other way around
bush aides said they were considering producing an ad off that exchange
campaigning thursday in hampton beach and newington mccain rolled his eyes when told of bush's comments
he's spinning like bill clinton mccain said
bush got a boost during the day when kemp the republicans' 1996 vice presidential nominee endorsed him at a campaign event at a nashua defense technology plant
governor bush is the one who can inspire the congress who can inspire the nation said kemp who endorsed forbes in 1996 before the publisher dropped out he called forbes a good friend and suggested that perhaps bush should name him treasury secretary
kemp a former new york congressman is also a former presidential contender as well as bob dole's running mate in the last election
forbes campaigning at the puritan backroom restaurant in manchester said he was not surprised at the endorsement even though he and kemp have worked together to promote a flat income tax and bush has failed to endorse one
jack's a very nice fellow he said but he is part of the establishment and it's no surprise the establishment would rally around its own especially when they realize they've met their match
as for mccain the arizona senator gives few signs that he is very encouraged by the polls in new hampshire he leads bush narrowly in tracking polls in the state ahead 40 percent to 35 percent in the cnn-usa today-gallup poll and 41 percent to 33 percent in a fox-wmur-university of new hampshire tracking poll
the error margin for the two tracking polls taken through wednesday night was plus or minus 4 percentage points
but wednesday night full of energy after the debate mccain appeared for a moment to be looking beyond the republican race we're going to beat gore like a drum he declared at a post-debate party in manchester
mccain's town hall meeting thursday at yoken's restaurant was packed the crowd spilled out into the halls and people in the back of the stifling room stood on chairs to see the candidate
meanwhile mccain released a new television ad that will air in new hampshire through the primary in it mccain promises to return government to whom it belongs the people the words character courage and ready to lead fade in over footage of mccain at town hall meetings
there was more talk about abortion thursday
good people can disagree on that issue bush said the night before he had said in the debate that if he could write a constitutional amendment on abortion it would say that the rights of the unborn are protected by law
alan keyes who finished third to bush and forbes in iowa challenged mccain in the debate for saying earlier in the day that it would be a family decision should his teen-age daughter become pregnant and want an abortion
keyes campaigning at a school in bedford on thursday said no pro-life republican can support mccain with any kind of confidence i'll tell you right now pro-life people who support mccain are throwing away their votes on someone who will betray us he does not have this conviction in his heart
mccain said thursday it's a little painful when your family is brought up but he said a candidate can't get angry about it
some reaction to president clinton's state of the union address
the president's agenda will help sustain record economic growth by paying down the national debt by 2013 it will make prudent use of the surplus to extend the life of social security and medicare and to provide a fiscally responsible middle-class tax cut unfortunately republicans have no plans to use one penny of the surplus to strengthen social security or medicare - house minority leader richard gephardt
without the republican congress to block big government programs and higher taxes proposed by the clinton-gore administration we wouldn't have a balanced budget much less the surplus we have now - jim nicholson republican national committee chairman

fortunately because of our founding fathers' foresight in creating a balance of power in our democracy congress will once again serve as the reality check for the president's kid in the candy store spending spree - rep steve largent r-okla
in medicare we are pleased that the president's proposal recognizes that it should be modernized with a prescription drug benefit that takes advantage of the advances in medicine likewise we welcome the proposal to expand health insurance coverage for working families and although the administration's proposal for a long-term care tax credit doesn't address every need it would certainly help many families - horace deets aarp executive director

tonight president bill clinton gave the nation his wish list for this session of congress there are many things we can accomplish if the president decides to work with us but if the president is forced by house democrats to cast aside bipartisan cooperation in favor of election-year politics the result will be gridlock and a failed agenda - house speaker dennis hastert r-ill
the speech tonight was a distortion of the seriousness of this country's fiscal crisis we need to sober up and realize that there are no surpluses and won't be unless we get serious about controlling runaway spending and tax cuts the country can't afford - sen fritz hollings d-sc
the president appears to be on the verge of taking our hard-fought fiscal prosperity and throwing it away with both hands the president is proposing to spend budget surpluses which may or may not materialize faster than they can be counted - us chamber of commerce

the us is the richest country in the history of the world in the midst of an unprecedented economic boom - of course we should increase spending on education - bob peterson fifth grade teacher in milwaukee
seeking to boost his standing among an increasingly politically active constituency vice president al gore boasted thursday of having more openly gay potential convention delegates in new york than bill bradley
the gore camp said that while its slate of delegates for the state's march 7 presidential primary included 11 openly gay candidates slates for the former senator from new jersey had just five openly gay people
the gore campaign later ended up wearing some egg when state party officials said bradley's campaign had reported having seven openly gay prospective delegates - not five as gore had claimed
bradley's campaign pounced
the al gore campaign continues to distort the facts in an attempt to win the democratic primary against senator bill bradley at any cost - even the cost of the truth bradley's campaign said in a statement accusing gore campaign of lies and distortions
peter ragon a spokesman for gore's new york campaign team conceded the mistake but said the error was the result of incorrection information given the campaign by the state party
grand rapids mich ap - elizabeth dole told students and teachers at an urban elementary school thursday that her former rival republican presidential candidate george w bush has the character and experience to help michigan families

mrs dole wife of the 1996 gop presidential nominee said she believes bush will win the new hampshire republican primary on tuesday

a teacher's comment shifted the spotlight back to mrs dole a former cabinet secretary who quit the gop presidential contest last year
some of us sure would have liked to have voted for you jana black a reading teacher told mrs dole
albany ny ap - squabbling over new york's presidential primary ballot continued thursday developer donald trump won the right to compete for independence party backing and steve forbes lost his spot on the republican ballot in three long island congressional districts
trump who is not an announced presidential candidate is considering running for the reform party's presidential nomination and his new york supporters are seeking to run delegate slates for him in the march 7 primary
but a coalition within the independence party new york's version of the reform party has been trying to have trump's delegates thrown off the ballot the democracy coalition supports trump nemesis and reform presidential candidate pat buchanan
in retaliation for the long island challenge to his petitions forbes has gone into state court in an attempt to get rival texas gov george w bush removed from the gop ballot in six districts in new york city
columbia sc ap - a south carolina democratic party member said thursday he has asked a federal judge to block the feb 19 republican presidential primary
a lawyer representing state rep todd rutherford of columbia asked the judge to block the primary unless the gop opens balloting at all precincts and conforms to federal voting rights laws
state gop chairman henry mcmaster said republicans plan to open all precincts and that the complaint won't hold up in court because the party primaries don't have to abide by federal election laws
there is no merit to those contentions mcmaster said
he would not say how many precincts already had arrangements to be staffed but said the party would try to open them all
a similar complaint is pending with the us justice department rutherford has accused the gop of deliberately trying to keep blacks from voting in the primary by keeping precincts closed
topeka kan ap - cancellation of the state's april 4 presidential primary could make it difficult for kansas republicans to get their delegation seated at the party's national convention this summer
state gop chairman mark parkinson worried wednesday that the 35 delegates may not receive credentials because the party had to change its plans for choosing them
without credentials they won't be able to vote on the party's national platform or its presidential nominee at the august convention in philadelphia
parkinson said he is working with the republican national committee and conceded that kansas would have a problem getting its delegates recognized only if the contest for the presidential nomination remained in doubt
but he also said we're scrambling
gov bill graves and other prominent republicans were not aware that canceling the election could cause such a problem graves plans to sign a bill that cuts the current state budget which includes a provision canceling the election
kansas democrats are not in the same situation
montevallo ala ap - reform party presidential candidate pat buchanan said no one should be offended to see the confederate battle flag flying over a public building
this flag flew over the battlefields it never flew over the slave fields buchanan said this week on a fund-raising swing through alabama
he said many great men fought and died for the flag which critics view as a symbol of slavery defenders see it as a symbol of southern heritage
buchanan said one of his great-grandfathers died at vicksburg miss fighting for the confederacy and another was captured outside of atlanta
the confederate battle flag was removed from the pole atop the alabama capitol dome in montgomery in 1993 after a lawsuit contended that state law provides only for the state and national flags to fly atop the capitol

president clinton urged states thursday to issue photo id licenses for handgun purchases much like licenses for driving or hunting
the proposal was the last from clinton's state of the union agenda that was not revealed in advance of thursday's speech the white house said it would go beyond the gun legislation clinton proposed last year which is stalled in committee
every state in this country already requires hunters and automobile drivers to have a license i think they ought to do the same thing for handgun purchases clinton said i hope you'll help me pass that in this congress
the national rifle association dismissed the licensing proposal as unworkable
what's it going to solve the criminals could care less said nra executive vice president wayne lapierre they're not going to stand in line they won't comply with it
under clinton's plan anyone who wants to buy a handgun would be required to first obtain a license showing he has passed a background check and a gun safety requirement such as a training course or an exam
states could choose not to participate in the program according to a white house official who discussed the proposal on condition of anonymity in states that decline to set up the licensing system a federally approved gun dealer or a federal entity would issue the license the official said
we are not mandating this the official said
tighter gun control already has emerged as an issue in the presidential campaign in fact clinton's licensing plan is very similar to one already offered by vice president al gore
gore's program calls for making gun license mandatory and requiring manufacturers and federally licensed sellers to report gun sales to state authority further gore would ban so-called saturday night specials and expand background checks and mandate child-safety locks
former sen bill bradley gore's rival for the democratic presidential nomination has urged mandatory licenses for handgun buyers and gun registration he also would raise license fees on dealers and ban saturday night specials
on the republican side texas gov george w bush has called for raising the age for handgun purchases to 21 he also supports instant background checks at gun shows bush opposes universal gun registration
steve forbes says he would let states set firearm standards
the proposal unveiled by clinton was part of an overall strategy seeking to tighten gun regulations and increase gun safety the president previously revealed he would seek $280 million in the fiscal 2001 budget for hiring more firearms agents and prosecutors at federal state and local levels tracing guns used in crimes increasing funding for ballistics tests
a judge on thursday threw sen john mccain out of the republican presidential primary in eight of new york's congressional districts one day after two democratic election officials helped him stay on those ballots
supreme court justice joseph cannizzaro overturned the state board of elections' decision to allow mccain to compete in the districts despite challenges from state republicans most of whom support gop presidential front-runner george w bush
in the challenged districts the arizona senator did not have the number of signatures on his presidential petitions that state law requires in order to qualify for the primary however mccain supporters argued that the signature requirement should not apply to him since he is a valid presidential candidate
new york election laws are generally considered the nation's most arcane but cannizzaro disagreed calling the signature requirements reasonable
gop candidates must get a certain number of signatures from party members to qualify for separate convention delegate slates in each of the state's 31 congressional districts in which they wish to compete in effect there are 31 separate gop primaries in new york
bush supporters had challenged mccain in 16 districts cannizzaro's decision leaves mccain off the ballot in a fourth of the state's districts
jeff buley a state republican committee lawyer working in support of bush cheered the decision we're pleased and think it was the proper decision he said
mccain's campaign lawyer henry berger said they had not yet decided whether to appeal mccain on friday planned to ask a federal judge to place him on the ballot in all 31 of new york's congressional districts
we are disappointed berger said but i'm going to see what happens in federal court and then make a decision whether to appeal
mccain said it was disturbing that such a thing would happen in the freest nation in the world he said bush should telephone gov george pataki and tell him to let john mccain on the ballot pataki supports bush
we all know that i'm a qualified candidate mccain told reporters after a town hall meeting at nashua high school in new hampshire
he said he would take the issue to the floor of the republican national convention in philadelphia this summer if the courts fail to satisfy him
with polls showing mccain running ahead of bush in new hampshire the battle over the new york primary ballot has taken on extra significance
in an ironic twist it was democrats who helped mccain stay on the ballot in those eight districts the two republican members of the state elections board had voted wednesday to uphold the challenges to mccain's petitions but the board's two democrats abstained thus depriving the bush camp of the third vote it needed to have the petitions invalidated
the state board had hoped to finalize the ballot by jan 31

mrs clinton with daughter chelsea by her side smiled at her husband and mouthed thank you' as she stood to acknowledge applause from her front-row seat in the visitors gallery the president applauded with the crowd for his wife
he also called on the entertainment industry to accept the first lady's challenge and to develop a single voluntary rating system for all children's entertainment that would be less confusing to parents
mrs clinton is drawing heavily from hollywood and the entertainment industry in her fund raising
the president focused his speech on broad issues such as ambitious plans to spend more to improve health care and education - some of the same issues mrs clinton will make key in her senate campaign
one of the specific initiatives the president mentioned - making college tuition tax deductible - first was advanced by democratic rep charles schumer of new york in his successful bid to oust gop sen alfonse damato in 1998
mrs clinton too is expected to campaign on that issue as she tries to appeal to some of the same middle-class suburban voters who helped schumer get elected
if she is successful in her bid for office the first lady will trade in her coveted seat in the gallery for a spot on the crowded house floor she now overlooks there she will be elbow-to-elbow with some of the same lawmakers who voted to impeach her husband

he said he would take the issue to the floor of the republican national convention in philadelphia this summer if the courts fail to satisfy him
new york election laws are generally considered the nation's most arcane but cannizzaro disagreed calling the signature requirements reasonable
it is not the prerogative of any single candidate to interpose his or her own judgment in place of that of the state legislature in this regard the judge said
gop candidates must get a certain number of signatures from party members to qualify for separate convention delegate slates in each of the state's 31 congressional districts in which they wish to compete in effect there are 31 separate gop primaries in new york

but the board's two democrats abstained thus depriving the bush camp of the third vote it needed to have the petitions invalidated for a lack of signatures
there was no clear indication thursday when the ballot for new york's march 7 primary would be finalized the state board had hoped to finalize the ballot by jan 31
cannizzaro's decision is merely the latest salvo in the ongoing battle over new york's march 7 presidential primary
mega-developer donald trump has won a battle to compete for independence party backing and steve forbes has lost his spot on the gop ballot in three long island congressional districts
but the battles now head to the courts
in retaliation for the long island challenges to his petitions forbes has gone into state court in an attempt to get bush knocked off the gop ballot in six new york city districts
anti-trump forces trying to grab control of new york's arm of the reform party known as the independence party have sued to get him off their ballot completely
trump is not an announced presidential candidate nonetheless he is considering running for the reform party's presidential nomination and his new york supporters are seeking to run delegate slates for him in the march 7 primary	 but the independence party's democracy coalition led by leftist activist lenora fulani have been trying to have trump's delegate slates thrown off the ballot claiming insufficient signatures from party members on his petitions
while fulani is backing conservative pat buchanan's bid for the reform party's nomination her faction is running delegate slates for the new york primary that are uncommitted to any candidate
the state chairman of the independence party jack essenberg is backing trump fulani is attempting to have essenberg removed as state party chairman
the state board of elections refused to throw trump off the ballot and an appeal of decision by the fulani forces is to be heard friday in a state court in albany
the ariens co a wisconsin-based snowblower manufacturer is recalling 27000 of its snowblowers because of reported fuel leaks the us consumer product safety commission said thursday
the company is recalling its ariens and lesco models because fuel can leak from a fuel-line connection
the recall includes five models of the ss332 and ss522 orange ariens units manufactured in 1997 and 1999 and the lss522 green lesco model the commission said
the recalled snowblowers were sold in retail outlets including home depot from july 1997 to january 2000 for $450 to $560 the commission said
people should stop using the blowers immediately and return the unit to a local dealer for free repair the commission said
president clinton has never had an easy time dealing with congress - even when democrats ran it - and he's gotten no signs from republican leaders that things are about to change this year
yet the fact that everybody but clinton is a candidate in 2000 is feeding a strange hope at the white house of actually getting something done before he leaves office the president even figures the agenda he articulated thursday night stands a better than 50-50 chance of passage
of course once he took the podium clinton tried to temper expectations about his legislative goals we will not reach them all this year not even in this decade but we will reach them
gop leaders politely accepted clinton's appeals for side-by-side action on issues like social security but they made it clear that they would simply ignore clinton if he is not open to their ideas
there are a number of priorities that are non-negotiable for republicans said rep jc watts r-okla chairman of the house republican conference he can either work with republicans or side with those in his party who block progress at every turn
to some clinton's prediction of last-minute legislative magic seems rather bold they say clinton should stick to bite-sized initiatives if having a legacy is important to him
there won't be anything that will be written about in the history books said marshall whitman director of congressional relations for the heritage foundation this president has the worst relationship with a congress since nixon left the white house grounds on the helicopter
but others say clinton's lame-duck status frees him to be an agent provocateur for vice president al gore using legislative proposals to try to force republicans into taking positions they must then defend before the voters
the truth is he has a lot of cards to play said al from president of the democratic leadership council the republicans have interests too they can't go to the voters having just blocked everything clinton's done
it is an added twist in the saga of clinton vs congress a story line that over seven years has hit upon nearly every type of conflict available to the executive and legislative branches of government
consider 1993 when a congress full of his fellow democrats sent clinton's ambitious health care reform package to a watery grave or 1994 when a restive electorate gave clinton a republican majority to contend with in congress forcing him to scrap his liberal-sounding agenda and start over from the middle
a great marching speech it went left-right left-right left-right rep jack kingston r-ga said of the 1995 state of the union address - which drew slow begrudging applause and was interrupted by shouts from the audience
later that same year though clinton emerged victorious from an epic struggle over balancing the budget that shut down the federal government the following year 1996 clinton and gop leaders regarded each other with studied cool uncertain of whose programs would play well on the campaign trail
more than clinton's legislative agenda hung in the balance when he went before congress in january 1998 the president had been accused of having an affair with former white house intern monica lewinsky which he denied
gop lawmakers seized upon the lewinsky matter as grounds for removing clinton from office the president struggled to secure passage of an asian financial bailout and failed to get approval for fast track trade negotiating authority before year's end clinton admitted to the affair and the house voted to impeach him
the impeachment was still playing out last january when clinton delivered his seventh state of the union address house members debated whether he should even be invited to give the speech since the senate had yet to vote on impeachment
clinton gave the speech anyway and republicans responded with distant unenthusiastic reactions majority leader dick armey r-texas and rep tom delay r-texas remained seated and gave him no applause at all
this year clinton is back as an impeachment survivor and gop leaders are speaking to him in terms that sound friendly - and ominous
in a letter wednesday house ways and means chairman bill archer r-texas sought cooperation on a social security initiative as we both know the news will soon focus on what you have and have not accomplished during your presidency archer said
editor's note - sonya ross has covered the clinton white house for the associated press since 1995
the law enforcement team investigating the death of jonbenet ramsey still has much information to review and has not given up trying to catch her killer boulder officials said thursday
district attorney alex hunter met with forensic and legal advisers to learn if any progress has been made since a grand jury ended its work on the case three months ago said hunter's spokeswoman suzanne laurion
she declined to give details of what was discussed
jonbenet was found beaten and strangled in the basement of her family's home dec 26 1996 the grand jury reviewing the 6-year-old's murder was dismissed oct 13 without filing any charges
it's not over for those of us that are working this case that care about jonbenet and do not want to give up on her hunter told reporters before the meeting
the honduran government announced thursday that it was investigating four generals for allegedly diverting $100 million from military budgets during a 14-year period
the investigation involves gens humberto regalado hernandez anulfo cantarero lopez luis alonso discua elvir and mario hung pacheco each of whom acted as commander-in-chief of the armed forces at different times between 1985 and 1999
honduran controller general vera rubi said in a news conference that the results of the investigation should be released soon
the annual budget for the honduran military is about $55 million between 1980 and 1989 however the armed forces received more than $1 billion from the united states to arm and finance the activities of about 14000 nicaraguan contra rebels and their families who established camps on the honduran side of the border
the contras were demobilized and repatriated in april 1990
a preliminary investigation has revealed that about $100 million cannot be accounted for during the 14-year period from 1985-99 rubi said
regalado hernandez was chief of the armed forces from 1986 to 1990 he was replaced by cantarero lopez who was in power for only 11 months before being overthrown discua elvir was in charge from 1990 to 1995 when he became an alternate ambassador at the united nations pacheco was the last commander-in-chief serving from 1995 to 1999 when control of the army was turned over to a civilian president
in january 1999 the honduran government ended decades of military dominance by ratifying constitutional reforms that eliminate the position of commander-in-chief of the army and disbanded the superior council the top military body
the current role of the armed forces is to fight drug and arms trafficking terrorism illiteracy and destruction of the environment
what a difference a year makes
last january the monica lewinsky scandal still swirled as hillary rodham clinton watched her husband's state of the union speech seated next to her was slugger sammy sosa of the chicago cubs for whom the first lady rooted while growing up in suburban chicago
this year she is an ardent new york yankee fan and owner of a $17 million home north of new york city that will serve as a base for her senate campaign
mrs clinton is raising millions of dollars to take on new york city mayor rudolph giuliani in what is shaping up as one of the nation's top political contests this year
as her husband delivers his last state of the union mrs clinton's political career is just beginning
she has moved out of the white house and into the home in chappaqua ny in a sign of just how much things have changed she commuted to washington for her husband's address from fund-raisers for her own campaign in south florida
president clinton paid tribute to his wife in his speech praising her work to streamline adoption and foster care programs
of course i am forever grateful to the person who has led our efforts from the beginning and who has worked so tirelessly for children and families for 30 years now my wife hillary he said
mrs clinton smiled at her husband and mouthed thank you as she stood to acknowledge applause from her front-row seat in the visitors gallery the president applauded with the crowd for his wife who sat between daughter chelsea and baseball hall-of-famer hank aaron
he also called on the entertainment industry to accept the first lady's challenge and to develop a single voluntary rating system for all children's entertainment that would be less confusing to parents
mrs clinton is drawing heavily from hollywood and the entertainment industry in her fund raising
the president focused his speech on broad issues such as ambitious plans to spend more to improve health care and education - some of the same issues mrs clinton will make key in her senate campaign
one of the specific initiatives the president mentioned - making college tuition tax deductible - first was advanced by democratic rep charles schumer of new york in his successful bid to oust gop sen alfonse damato in 1998
mrs clinton too is expected to campaign on that issue as she tries to appeal to some of the same middle-class suburban voters who helped schumer get elected
if she is successful in her bid for office the first lady will trade in her coveted seat in the gallery for a spot on the crowded house floor she now overlooks there she will be elbow-to-elbow with some of the same lawmakers who voted to impeach her husband
the state of the union and the state of al gore's campaign are so intertwined that the vice president made sure one man has his fingerprints on both efforts
bob shrum who is traveling with gore in the final days of the new hampshire campaign helped write the address that president clinton delivered thursday night in washington dovetailing with gore's campaign proposals and giving him credit for administration achievements
so it was no surprise that the speech was peppered with laudatory references to gore as in with the help of the vice president and i propose we follow vice president gore's suggestion clinton even borrowed from the vice president's campaign platform proposing photo ids for handgun purchases
he flubbed one attempt to praise gore saying his vice president helped make communities more liberal gore laughed as clinton corrected himself more livable
if gore has his way he will benefit as much as clinton from the nationally televised address
i have fought alongside this president for the economy and for the other important things we have seen from the clinton-gore administration the vice president told new hampshire public radio hours later gore flew to washington to take his traditional state of the union perch behind clinton - looking down on congress applauding his boss and basking in the president's praise
shrum said that scene will help gore in his campaign against bill bradley the former new jersey senator rocked in the vice president's 2-to-1 victory in the iowa caucuses is struggling to stay close to the front-running gore in state polls
the vice president's there at the address he's doing his job people believe he has the experience and skills to keep the prosperity and the economy in good shape shrum said between campaign stops with the vice president any kind of visual confirmation will be very helpful
so helpful indeed that bradley's campaign has accused the white house of purposely scheduling the address five days before tuesday's election
al gore has been a loyal vice president but his loyalty hasn't translated into a bold vision for where we need to go into the next decade bradley spokesman eric hauser said as clinton delivered the address
shrum is a full-time campaign adviser and a part-time white house consultant putting him at the intersection of clinton's policies and gore's politics
the washington operative played down his role saying he hadn't been involved in the address in several days even then i didn't see my role as a representative of the vice president i was helping the president shrum said
still advisers say shrum and the vice president's west wing staff left their mark on the speech gore's chief of staff charles burson reviewed early drafts and attended rehearsals with the president and his staff
the address included new children's health care environment and technology programs that fit gore's campaign themes
in the runup to the speech clinton announced emergency subsidies for low-income families to pay heating bills in about a dozen states including $54 million for this state alone shortly before the iowa caucuses clinton gave his vice president credit for a new health care initiative
this is the latest evolution of what gore himself called a complex relationship with clinton just as polls show most americans are torn between their approval of clinton's performance and their disappointment with his personal behavior gore seems to have wavered between embracing his boss and pushing him away
but the vice president says people oversimplify their relationship it's not true that i'm either distancing myself from him or that i'm trying to run as a derivative candidate gore told new hampshire public radio
analysts said gore can link himself to clinton this week because eight out of 10 new hampshire democrats approve of clinton's job performance even if his personal approval rating is much lower gore also stands to benefit from dramatic improvements in new hampshire's economy since the 1992 presidential campaign
i think as far as the primaries are concerned this is good for gore as long as the focus is on clinton's programs and not him personally said david rhode political science professor at michigan state university
other analysts said gore has already rounded up the pro-clinton vote thus the address won't pad his margin over bradley
everybody knows he's clinton's vice president so i don't think it adds much said democratic consultant jim duffy of washington but then again the timing can't hurt duffy added
washington ap president clinton proposed a $350 billion tax cut big spending increases for schools and health care and photo id licenses for handgun purchases thursday as he offered the final agenda of his presidency the state of our union is the strongest it has ever been he said
at the start of an election-year clinton issued a stinging rebuke in his last state of the union address for too long this congress has been standing still on some of our most pressing national priorities he chided
the president noted that next month the united states will achieve the longest period of economic growth in the nation's history and called on americans to set great goals
the president offered a long litany of initiatives many of them sure to be rewritten or ignored by congress his tax cut proposals were intended primarily to promote educational opportunities and expand health insurance and child care for lower- and middle-income americans the initiatives included relief from the marriage penalty - an idea first championed by republicans - and a new program of retirement savings accounts
most of the proposals were released in advance but the white house withheld clinton's gun licensing measure until the last minute to build suspense similar to a plan offered by vice president al gore it would require handgun purchasers to first obtain a state license showing they have passed a background check and a gun safety requirement such as a training course or an exam
states could choose not to participate in the program the national rifle association condemned the plan as pointless and unworkable
every state in this country already requires hunters and automobile drivers to have a license i think they ought to do the same thing for handgun purchases clinton said i hope you'll help me pass that in this congress
clinton called for passage of a patients' bill of rights to strengthen consumer protection gun-safety legislation campaign finance reform an increase in the minimum wage and votes on long-stalled judicial nominations
republicans ridiculed clinton's proposals but did not rule out working with him on such issues as education and health care if we enacted all the new programs the president has talked about we'd spend just about the entire surplus on bigger and more expensive government said house speaker dennis hastert r-ill
clinton was greeted by applause and handshakes by republicans and democrats alike his wife hillary and daughter chelsea home from college were in the audience his speech will go into the record books as his longest state of the union address 89 minutes besting his 1995 record of 81 minutes
more than an hour into his speech clinton flubbed a line meant to credit gore with helping making communities more livable instead clinton said liberal - not once but twice the audience - gore included - guffawed
five days before the new hampshire primary clinton seized the chance to boost gore in his race for the democratic presidential nomination in his speech there were six references to the vice president clinton also recognized another candidate the first lady running for the us senate seat in new york
many of clinton's proposals were repackaged from earlier years and in some cases resubmitted with spending figures double or triple the original amount
clinton boasted that the nation has been lifted from economic distress social decline and political gridlock
we begin the new century with over 20 million new jobs the fastest economic growth in more than 30 years the lowest unemployment rates in 30 years the lowest poverty rates in 20 years the lowest african-american and hispanic unemployment rates on record the first back-to-back surpluses in 42 years
in offering his gun licensing plan clinton said we've all seen what happens when guns fall into the wrong hands the president said his words recalled the tragedy of the massacre at columbine high school tom mauser the father of slain student daniel mauser was among those invited to listen to clinton's speech in a vip box with the first lady
the president boasted of the nation's upbeat times
never before has our nation enjoyed at once so much prosperity and social progress with so little internal crisis or so few external threats the president said never before have we had such a blessed opportunity - and therefore such a profound obligation - to build the more perfect union of our founders' dreams
clinton's tax program includes marriage penalty relief tax deductions of up to $2800 annually per family for college tuition and fees and retirement savings accounts for low- and moderate-income families he also proposed steps to encourage charitable giving
the president's tax package joined a mix of proposals urged by republicans and democrats as both sides battle for control of congress and the white house smarting from clinton's veto of their $792 billion tax-cut package last year house republicans are drafting their own version of educational tax breaks and marriage penalty relief this year presidential candidates have their own proposals too
rep bill archer r-texas chairman of the ways and means committee called clinton's tax cuts too limited we think all americans deserve tax relief not just the handful the president picks archer said
the president's tax package would cost $350 billion over 10 years however his plan envisions cutting that price tag by $100 billion by closing tax havens shelters and loopholes congress has previously rejected many of those ideas on grounds they are tax increases
there were no major foreign policy announcements although clinton urged congress to give china permanent normal trading relations with the united states he also asked for $16 billion for colombia to fight narco-traffickers
clinton said the united states must help russia and china become strong prosperous democratic nations both are behind held back from reaching their full potential - russia by the legacy of communism economic turmoil a cruel and self-defeating war in chechnya china by the illusion that it can buy stability at the expense of freedom
the booming economy and swelling tax revenues give clinton and republicans a big purse for any tax reductions or spending increases both sides claim they are dedicated to protecting social security and eliminating the national debt
clinton also
called anew for medicare to include a prescription drug benefit and to let people as young as 55 buy medicare coverage - this time with a 25 percent tax credit

excerpts from president clinton's state of the union address education
because education is more than ever the key to our children's future we must make sure all our children have that key that means quality preschool and afterschool the best trained teachers in every classroom and college opportunities for all our children
all successful schools have followed the same proven formula higher standards more accountability so all children can reach those standards i have sent congress a reform plan based on that formula each year the national government invests more than $15 billion in our schools it's time to support what works and stop supporting what doesn't prescription drug coverage
in good conscience we cannot let another year pass without extending to all seniors the lifeline of affordable prescription drugs record numbers of americans are providing for aging or ailing loved ones at home last year i proposed a $1000 tax credit for long-term care frankly that wasn't enough this year let's triple it to $3000 - and this year let's pass it crime &amp gun control
crime in america has dropped for the past seven years - the longest decline on record thanks to a national consensus we helped to forge on community police sensible gun safety laws and effective prevention but nobody believes america is safe enough so let's set a higher goal let's make america the safest big country in the world
we must strengthen gun laws and better enforce laws already on the books federal gun crime prosecutions are up 16 percent since i took office but again we must do more i propose to hire more federal and local gun prosecutors and more atf agents to crack down on illegal gun traffickers and bad-apple dealers and we must give law enforcement the tools to trace every gun - and every bullet - used in a crime in america globalization
to keep our historic economic expansion going we need a 21st century revolution to open new markets start new businesses and hire new workers right here in america - in our inner cities poor rural areas and on indian reservations our nation's prosperity has not yet reached these places everywhere i've gone i've met talented people eager for opportunity and able to work let's put them to work
for business it's the smart thing to do for america it's the right thing to do and if we don't do it now when will we ever get around to it foreign policy
america cannot prevent every conflict or stop every outrage but where our interests are at stake and we can make a difference we must be peacemakers
the same advances that have shrunk cell phones to fit in the palms of our hands can also make weapons of terror easier to conceal and easier to use
in a world where 12 billion people live on less than a dollar a day we must do our part in the global endeavor to reduce the debts of the poorest countries so they can invest in education health and economic growth - as the pope and other religious leaders have urged last year congress made a down payment on america's share and i ask for your continued support environment
the greatest environmental challenge of the new century is global warming many people in the united states and around the world still believe we can't cut greenhouse gas pollution without slowing economic growth in the industrial age that may have been true in the digital economy it isn't diversity
in a little more than 50 years there will be no majority race in america in a more interconnected world this diversity can be our greatest strength america is stronger for it but as we have seen these differences all too often spark hatred and division even here at home no american should be subjected to discrimination in finding a home getting a job going to school or securing a loan

tony amonte had two goals and two assists thursday night as the chicago blackhawks ended a three-game losing streak with a 6-4 victory over the colorado avalanche
amonte who hadn't scored in six games and doug gilmour connected 337 apart late in the second period to snap a 2-2 tie after the avalanche had rebounded from a 2-0 deficit
jean-yves leroux eric daze and dean mcammond also had goals for the blackhawks who handed colorado only its third loss in 15 games
peter forsberg chris drury aaron miller and sandis ozolinsh scored for the avalanche who were outshot 10-0 by chicago in the opening seven minutes
leroux strarted the scoring 57 seconds into the game when his shot off a centering pass from josef marha beat goalie marc denis daze made it 2-0 at 522
forsberg cut it to 2-1 with 26 seconds left in the first with a power-play goal drury tied it at 2-all at 1022 of the second period but goals by amonte and gilmour late in the period restored chicago's lead to 4-2
on a 2-on-1 break with martin skoula drury faked a pass and then fooled jocelyn thibault with a low shot just inside the goalpost
amonte's deflection however completed a give-and-go with gilmour to make it 3-2 with 446 left in the second gilmour then redirected boris mironov's feed with 109 remaining in the period to stretch it to 4-2
mcammond was credited with making it 5-2 at 654 of the third however it appeared amonte's centering pass went in off a colorado defender

the cavs playing their second home game following a rough trip to the west made 32 free throws to snap orlando's three-game winning streak
cedric henderson added 16 points in his fourth straight double-digit game for the cavs who are hoping to put together a win streak before the all-star break to position themselves for a playoff push in the second half
darrell armstrong had 21 points and tariq abdul-wahad 17 for the magic who didn't score for two extended stretches in the third quarter when the cavs built a 12-point lead
and for one of the few times this season cleveland was able to open a big lead and finish off the job
kemp who had fouled out of four of his previous six games got the magic in foul trouble instead
he consistently drove the lane on orlando's frontline defenders and was able to pick up touch fouls on charles outlaw chris gatling and ben wallace kemp finished 12-of-15 from the line
the cavs opened the second half with an 8-0 run as the magic went the first 527 without scoring but just when cleveland looked like it might take control the cavs went cold from the floor and didn't score for a 411 span as orlando pullled to 63-59 on corey maggette's jumper
but orlando went into another offensive funk failing to score for another 417 as the cavs opened a 76-64 lead after three
good thing the lawmakers and guests kept standing up to clap during president clinton's state of the union speech on thursday night sitting for 89 minutes straight might have been a little uncomfortable
clinton's final state of the union address was also his longest - beating by eight minutes the record he set in 1995
on paper the speech to a joint session of congress was 200 words shorter than last year's speech clinton said afterward
i thought it would be five minutes shorter than last year's speech which ran 77 minutes he said
clinton blamed the overrun on 128 rounds of applause although his own ad libs added several dozen words
since taking office in 1993 clinton's shortest state of the union speech was in 1997 at 60 minutes last year the president spoke for 77 minutes
the shortest state of the union ever was an 833-word written statement from george washington clinton's text this year ran more than 8000 words
clinton is well-known for lingering at the lectern
in 1988 clinton ignored flashing red lights and other attempts to cut him off during a presidential nominating speech for massachusetts gov michael dukakis allotted 15 minutes clinton spoke for 32 minutes the democratic national convention audience applauded when clinton began a sentence i want to say in closing 
the white house warned ahead of time that clinton might take his time thursday
rumors of a halftime show are greatly exaggerated press secretary joe lockhart said before the speech
the president's guests for thursday's state of the union address included a decorated air force pilot a member of the world cup-winning women's soccer team and the father of a teen-ager killed in the shootings at columbine high school
most of the guests were being seated alongside first lady hillary rodham clinton one guest former treasury secretary lloyd bentsen was to take a seat on the house floor the president was expected to refer to some of his guests in the speech his eighth and final state of the union address
the guests were
pat brown of johnson city tenn a retiree who spends $4000 of her savings each year on prescription drugs for heart and thyroid ailments
ruth summerlin an elementary school principal in beaufort sc who improved her students' reading and math test scores so dramatically that the school went from one of south carolina's 200 worst to a blue-ribbon citation from the education department in five years

house speaker dennis hastert invited an illinois-area cardinal to the address as his guest amid a controversy over the rejection of a roman catholic priest to be the house's new chaplain
hastert denied to reporters earlier thursday that cardinal francis george of chicago was in attendance to quell criticism from catholics cardinal george is a friend of mine he said
the speaker said he was not sure if the cardinal was invited before or after a brouhaha erupted last month over the rejection of the rev timothy o'brien a catholic priest from wisconsin as the house chaplain
catholics and democrats have charged that hastert r-ill and majority leader dick armey r-texas chose the rev charles parker wright a presbyterian minister despite the preference of a bipartisan selection committee for o'brien the house has never had a catholic chaplain a post that pays $132100 a year
at the dawn of the nation benjamin franklin looked at a painting of a sun low on the horizon and decided it must be rising president clinton told congress on thursday night
in his final state of the union speech he made no reference to the fact that his own presidency was slowly sinking in the sky
smooth as ever - except when he talked about encouraging liberal communities instead if livable ones - clinton told lawmakers there was so much to do left unstated was that he won't be around to do all or even much of it with less than a year before he's gone
let's was his favorite exhortation i ask you he said i implore you
we must
longwinded he outlasted many in his audience
more than 50 seats on the republican side and at least 15 on the democratic side emptied before the 89-minute address was done
behind clinton as president of the senate sat al gore who by this time next year wants to be president of the united states in the gallery sat hillary rodham clinton who hopes to win a senate seat from new york
they were silent witnesses to clinton's valedictory to congress but since they came in first they got ovations of their own and clinton plugged each of them in his remarks
not since 1988 had congress sat for a state of the union speech from a president certain to be gone in a year
back then it was ronald reagan in front of a congress controlled by democrats many of whom had had their fill of the man and his boundless optimism
the feel-good slogans have gone flat with time west virginia sen robert byrd then majority leader said that night he spoke of the reagan administration in the past tense even though it had almost a year to go
mindful that it's just one small step from legacy to lame duck as he recently joked clinton tried to make sure he continues to be reckoned with
republican sen phil gramm of texas for one wasn't buying it
president clinton apparently intends these final months in office to be spent buffing his image for history he said but the torch is about to be passed to a new leader and i believe that most of the old administration's spending proposals should be and will be discreetly discarded
clinton spoke in circumstances far less perilous than his last state of the union speech that came a month after he was impeached by the house three weeks before his acquittal by the senate
then republican leaders who were either feigning or feeling boredom and whose hostility was ill concealed whispered to each other through the speech and ignored most ovation lines
this year they were lighter on their feet and quicker to clap and clinton made a point of giving them something to applaud for
after urging stiffer restrictions on guns opposed by many republicans in congress he threw them a bone he said existing gun laws must be better enforced - precisely what the republicans have been saying to his administration
that brought them to their feet
outside the capitol dome glowed in the biting cold from spotlights that fell too on a hilly expanse of snow
inside a little of the usual luster was missing with all supreme court justices begging off in a brief note from the court citing travel plans and minor illnesses but thanking the sergeant of arms for the invitations
so no judicial robes but there was brass
the nation's high military leaders listened with their shining shoulder stars as is their custom they applauded tributes from their commander to the men and women in uniform and sat impassively through his oratory on domestic policy

unprecedented levels of margin debt the amount of money borrowed by individual investors to purchase stocks has some analysts concerned with potential fallout in the event of a market downturn
it's a serious subject and it's creating concern because it's really a measure of investor confidence said alan skrainka chief market strategist at edward jones a st louis brokerage firm
when you see masses of people doing it at once it says the crowd thinks there's very little chance that stocks are going to go down but we know from history that stock markets aren't a one-way street he said thursday
even federal reserve chairman alan greenspan is expressing concern about the level of margin debt saying wednesday during testimony before the senate that the central bank is studying the matter
americans had borrowed $2285 billion to buy stock as of dec 31 1999 up from $141 billion a year earlier - a 62 percent jump according to ned davis research a venice fla market data firm in 1990 the figure stood at around $35 billion
borrowing accelerated rapidly in the last months of 1999 when the technology-heavy nasdaq stock market was surging upward at an unprecedented rate said sam burns a research analyst at ned davis
concerns have surfaced over the buying on margin because a significant market downturn could wipe out hundreds of thousands of debt-ridden investors and exacerbate a widespread selling panic
here's how the scenario could unfold burns said
investors borrow money to buy stock in the hope that the stock will increase in value
the stock purchased on margin is used as collateral against the value of the loan
if the stock goes up everyone's happy because the investor can use the profits to pay back the borrowed money plus interest charged by the lender - usually the investor's broker
but if the stock price falls thus lowering the value of the lender's collateral the lender can make what's known as a margin call which requires the borrower to put up more cash to ensure that the loan is repaid in full
margin calls are usually covered by selling the stock purchased on margin and that's where things get sticky according to burns
should us stock markets stumble at some point hundreds of thousands of margin investors would likely sell stock into an already falling market to pay back their margin loans
those margin-related sales would only contribute to a selling panic burns explained
many historians blame the 1929 stock market crash on widespread margin buying among investors who were then forced to sell stock to pay back their loans when the market tanked
the federal reserve board which regulates margin borrowing currently requires investors to have at least $2000 in a trading account to buy on margin in addition investors are limited to purchasing $2 of stock for every $1 in their account
on wednesday greenspan said the federal reserve was reluctant to exercise its authority to tighten limits on such borrowing saying that studies have suggested that a rising level of stock prices is unrelated to liberal margin requirements
the new york stock exchange and the national association of securities dealers which oversees the nasdaq stock market are seeking changes that would increase to $25000 the minimum amount some active traders need to keep in their accounts
the move is designed to ensure that investors who want to borrow money to buy stocks have plenty of collateral to pay back their debts
the securities and exchange commissions is also discussing the issue with the fed the nyse and the nasd said spokesman chris ullman to get their perspectives on what is the actual margin situation
but not everyone supports the changes
jeff tappan the co-founder of mtradercom an educational online site for active traders said margin borrowing has traditionally allowed small investors an opportunity to take a larger stake in the markets
it's a very valuable tool because it provides leverage tappan said without it you're playing against a stacked deck
small investor advocates frequently complain that the markets are biased in favor of large institutional investors such as pension and mutual funds
yet tappan acknowledged that certain investors such as day traders accept tremendous risks when they borrow money to speculate on the markets day traders buy and sell thousands of shares betting on the movement of the stock to make money
the practice of borrowing money to day trade came under scrutiny last july when debt-ridden trader mark barton killed nine people at two atlanta brokerage firms
ronald greenburg bought 100 shares of the coca-cola co in 1988 because he heard investor warren buffett was buying $1 billion worth
greenburg a 50-year-old from steubenville ohio who works in the diamond business continued to buy shares of coca-cola over the next 12 years and now even after the worst 18 months in company history greenburg's faith in big red is unshaken
you can't judge a good company by a few awkward quarters greenburg said i feel that way so much
investor uncertainty has hit coke's stock hard recently but some analysts say the company remains a good choice for people who invest for the long term
coke has suffered through three tough years and wednesday said it was eliminating 6000 jobs - more than one-fifth of its work force
coke shares have since fallen nearly 10 percent trading thursday at $5950 on the new york stock exchange
but douglas lane an analyst at merrill lynch &amp co in new york calls the market response an overreaction
in fact lane said he is encouraging investors to buy coke stock now - not only for its long-term potential but because he expects coke to bounce back soon
lane said the job cuts put coca-cola back on course after nearly two years of falling profits and image problems he expects a more efficient coca-cola to resume its strong growth toward the end of this year and into 2001
this is not the time to be looking in the rear-view mirror at coke he said
phil larkins who manages money for wealthy clients at atlanta-based legacy south said none of his clients have called him about getting rid of their coke holdings
given the premier global distribution network they have and given the fact that it's the no 1 recognized brand name in the world it still has a certain comfort level for long-term investors larkins said thursday
but there is still some uncertainty incoming ceo doug daft indicated that long-term growth goals have been too ambitious and the company will not give details on its new strategic plan for another six months
without some further clarity from the company short-term investors are likely to stay away analysts said that could come as early as today when coke executives travel to new york for a briefing for analysts
the company suffered a string of setbacks during the last 18 months including a severe economic downturn in asian markets a discrimination lawsuit filed by a group of minority employees and a costly product recall and two failed takeover bids in europe
the largest job cutback in coke's 113-year-history announced wednesday will affect 2500 positions at the company's atlanta headquarters 800 elsewhere in the united states and 2700 outside the country
the reorganization is aimed at reducing control from atlanta and giving more power to managers around the world some stock analysts said the job cuts were a tacit admission by coke that it had become bloated and overinvested in some markets
coke estimated that the job cuts will save $300 million a year but said earnings would be reduced by $800 million before taxes this year to the cover costs of the realignment
tim swanson an analyst for ag edwards in st louis said the job cuts will let the company react more efficiently to changes in the global economy he said its stock price will improve as the economy improves in other parts of the world
their bottom line performance is very tied to the global economy swanson said
the move may have been good for investors but it hit employees hard
there's very low morale and a lot of questions coke employee camille martin said thursday outside the company's gated compound there's a lot of fixing up this company has to do
ms martin voluntarily turned in her resignation notice two months ago but said her co-workers in the accounting department will not find out who loses their jobs for another two weeks
even though coca-cola is one of atlanta's most prominent companies the job cuts should not hurt the booming local economy said don ratajczak director of economic forecasting at georgia state university in atlanta
how significant is this layoff to atlanta's economy psychologically it's huge economically it's small ratajczak said
coca-cola barely sneaks into the top 20 employers in the city ratajczak said
in the last 12 months atlanta created 115000 jobs - more jobs than all of new england created in the same time period ratajczak said with an unemployment rate of only 26 percent the displaced workers from coke should have little trouble finding jobs
now that financial titan chase manhattan corp has agreed to ask account holders before selling their names to outside marketers will other banks offer similar privacy protections to lure customers
don't bank on it
most big banks aren't ready to do that and it might ultimately be up to states to compel them to tighten their privacy practices a consumer advocate said thursday
if chase can do it that means other banks can do it frank torres legislative counsel for consumers union said about the new settlement agreement between chase and new york state's attorney general
however he added most big banks remain strongly opposed to this type of privacy requirement under the agreement chase must have written consent from account holders before it can sell or share their data with outside marketers
at the same time financial institutions are concerned about recent privacy enforcement actions against banks by several states as well as an initiative by some states to enact new privacy laws that are stricter than federal requirements congress established in november
the states are fully engaged said john byrne senior counsel for the american bankers association banks around the country are taking stock of their privacy procedures he said some banks will decide on their own to go beyond the mandated procedures if that's what their customers want to see
under the settlement accord announced tuesday by attorney general eliot spitzer in albany ny chase agreed to stop providing outside marketers with the credit line and balance information of customers as many as 22 million consumers had been affected chase the nation's third-largest bank holding company has some $370 billion in assets
the case really demonstrates the need for legislation that protects consumers from having their personal sensitive financial information distributed outside of the bank said barry steinhardt associate director of the american civil liberties union i hope other banks follow chase but i'm not optimistic
manhattan-based chase agreed not to share any customer data with outside marketers such as telemarketers without customers' express written consent even in cases where customers do give their permission chase agreed to provide only their names addresses and telephone numbers to the marketing firms but not any financial data
this is stricter than the privacy provision in the new federal law which allows banks and other financial institutions to share customers' data with outside firms unless customers expressly ask them not to do so
the financial services industry had opposed even this more lenient requirement it won the right in the legislation for banks securities firms and insurance companies that are affiliated under the same corporate roof to share customers' data customers are unable to stop such sharing by affiliated financial companies
the case involving chase arose from an investigation by spitzer's office into allegations that the bank had provided customer information to marketers in violation of its own privacy policy as disclosed to consumers the data it shared was said to have included encrypted account numbers and loan data
the marketing firms used the information to phone chase customers to try selling them emergency road service plans discount shopping clubs legal services travel clubs garden supplies and magazine subscriptions chase received a commission on successful sales
while it agreed to the settlement chase denied any wrongdoing state officials said they hadn't accused the bank of anything illegal but they promised to pursue similar enforcement actions against other financial companies
robert schmermund a spokesman for america's community bankers suggested that privacy policies could be a very effective tool for banks to market themselves to consumers and retain customers
but byrne said his group would not want to see banks competing against one another on the basis of privacy protections
it would be self-defeating for banks to claim they had stricter privacy policies than rival institutions byrne maintained attractive prices and a variety of services should remain the basis for competition he said
defense industry analysts said they doubt the 2800 layoffs announced by lockheed martin will be enough to help the defense contractor's troubled aeronautics and space divisions
analyst joseph campbell of lehman brothers called lockheed's effort to downsize important steps in the right direction but lots more to go
this is part of a thousand little things they need to do campbell said
the plans for a 2 percent reduction in a work force of 140000 were announced thursday and follow a series of disappointments and losses the company said the cuts would generate $200 million in annual savings
the bethesda-based company was expected to release its fourth-quarter and year-end earnings today analysts surveyed by first call/thomson financial estimated the company would earn 59 cents a share for the quarter and $149 a share for the year
paul nisbet of jsa research inc said lockheed will have to do more than adjust the size of its work force but said that reducing some layers of management would allow better communication between workers and the front office
the majority of those savings will be achieved in the aeronautical systems business which would be consolidated into a single unit to be called lockheed martin aeronautics co headquartered in fort worth texas and headed by dain hancock a lockheed martin executive vice president
the 2500 job cuts in the aeronautics division will come in approximately equal measure from the company's three primary sites in georgia california and texas the company said additional personnel reductions of 2000 people previously announced for the marietta ga facility bring the total workforce reduction to 4500 in that sector
in addition the space systems business will establish a new lockheed martin space systems co in denver that will be led by albert smith another executive vice president
the palmdale calif site would continue advanced development initiatives the fort worth and marietta ga facilities will focus on aircraft production and assembly the company said
four sub-assembly plants in clarksburg west va johnstown pa meridian miss and pinellas fla will report to the new lockheed martin aeronautics company
these actions are the direct result of our continuing drive to improve our customer focus flatten our management structure and enhance our financial performance said vance coffman chairman and chief executive officer of lockheed martin they will result in real savings and ensure greater flexibility allowing us to successfully adapt to changing market conditions maintain the level of program execution our customers expect while improving our ability to react to new business opportunities
peter b teets lockheed's president and chief operating officer stepped down last year taking responsibility for disappointing financial results which led the defense contractor to slash its earnings estimates for this year by more than half
james mickey blackwell also left as head of aeronautical systems which makes the f-16 jet fighter and was the poorest performer last year among lockheed's four core businesses
canada's intelligence agency said thursday it had investigated a man now reportedly in custody in senegal for involvement in an alleged terrorist bombing plot in the united states
another man implicated in the alleged plot ahmed ressam pleaded innocent in federal court in seattle on thursday to charges of involvement in the alleged plot
ressam an algerian was arrested dec 14 for allegedly trying to smuggle bomb-making components from canada into the united states three other algerian nationals and a woman married to an algerian are in custody and police in the united states and canada are searching for another algerian
the new york times reported thursday that mohambedou ould slahi was arrested in senegal at the request of us authorities who suspect him of organizing the bomb plot it said no charges have been filed but that the united states would seek slahi's extradition
according to the times report slahi's brother-in-law is a top lieutenant of saudi millionaire osama bin laden bin laden is one of 18 people indicted in the united states on charges of conspiracy to attack americans in the 1998 bombings of us embassies in kenya and tanzania that killed 224 people including 12 americans bin laden is believed to be in afghanistan
in washington a law enforcement official who requested anonymity said investigators were not sure whether slahi was a major figure in the bomb plot or merely a messenger the official also said us investigators are unsure if slahi's brother-in-law is a key bin laden aide
no specific evidence has been released that shows bin laden was behind the alleged bombing plot and authorities have not said what the targets might have been
slahi was in canada before going to senegal said dan lambert spokesman for the canadian security intelligence service sometime after ressam's dec 14 arrest slahi left due in part to the investigation that was ongoing lambert said he declined to provide any details of the case
the secretary of a montreal mosque where slahi stayed described him as a devout muslim who led prayers every day bahaa elbatal said slahi moved into the assunna mosque early in the month and stayed until jan 21 when he presumably left the country
i never felt he was a dangerous person elbatal said
a senior government official in senegal and an officer at the central police station in dakar told the associated press friday they knew nothing of slahi's detention
a us official in senegal declined to comment another us official speaking on condition of anonymity said the situation was sensitive
little was revealed about slahi a citizen of mauritania but investigators told the times he was in constant contact with a construction company in sudan that was owned by bin laden and was a front for bin laden's international organization al qaeda
last fall slahi traveled to montreal where he worked closely with mokhtar haouri one of the algerians charged with helping ressam
american officials said there are other emerging links between the bomb plot and bin laden one involves hamid aich an algerian who lived for three years in a vancouver suburb where he shared an apartment with abdelmajid dahoumane the times said
dahoumane accused of being ressam's accomplice remains at large
irish police said they arrested aich on dec 21 and seized personal papers and computer records they released him the following day and gave the seized material to the fbi for analysis superintendent john farrelly said
in france judicial sources said thursday that a paris court had opened an inquiry last week against a person or persons for criminal association in relation to a terrorist operation they did not identify the target of the investigation but said it followed the ressam arrest in the united states
a french anti-terrorism judge went to the united states earlier this month to lead the inquiry the sources said
smoking among high schoolers dropped in 1999 for the first time since the government began keeping track at the start of the decade but nearly one in 10 children have already smoked cigarettes by middle school
a nationwide survey of 7529 high schoolers in september and october found that 284 percent reported smoking cigarettes in the preceding month the centers for disease control and prevention said thursday
in 1997 the last time the cdc looked at high school smoking 364 percent of students said they had smoked in the preceding month at the time teen smoking was on the rise from 348 percent in 1995 and 275 percent in 1991 the first year the cdc started keeping track
the cdc said it expected teen smoking rates to drop - just not by so much the agency said differences between the 1999 survey and earlier studies may have exaggerated the decline
we may have peaked in terms of smoking rates among high school students said michael eriksen director of the cdc's office on smoking and health
the drop in smoking rates had been expected because tobacco companies raised cigarette prices about 45 cents a pack last year to help pay for the $206 billion national settlement
as part of the settlement billboard ads for cigarettes were banned and the tobacco industry was barred from running advertisements with cartoon characters such as joe camel that anti-smoking activists say are aimed at youngsters in many places cigarette billboards have been replaced by signs with anti-smoking messages
for the first time ever the cdc also surveyed middle school students about smoking questioning about as many middle-schoolers as high school students
nine percent of the students in grades six through eight said they had smoked cigarettes nearly 13 percent said they had used some tobacco product - including chewing tobacco pipes and cigars
i don't think it was that surprising because we see such high rates in high school that we know it begins in middle school we just didn't know at what level eriksen said
ron todd director of tobacco control for the american cancer society agreed that higher cigarette prices should result in fewer smokers of high school age but he said the cdc's numbers surprised him
i wouldn't expect a decline that dramatic todd said we'll have to continually monitor it to get a better picture of what's really going on
the questions used in the surveys and the one in 1997 were the same said wick warren a cdc statistician but response rates varied about 90 percent of schools responded to the 1999 tobacco survey the earlier surveys which also included questions about sex got responses from about 75 percent of schools
the study also found that the wide gap in smoking rates between white and black high school students does not exist among middle-schoolers
the proportion of blacks smoking in high school was nearly 16 percent - half the percentage of white smokers but in middle school both racial groups were about 9 percent
though it is too soon to tell this could signal the end of a 25-year trend in which blacks started smoking later than whites
two trendy types of imported cigarettes - bidis and kreteks - are being smoked by about 5 percent of high schoolers and 2 percent of middle-schoolers that makes them almost as popular as chewing tobacco
bidis are skinny unfiltered indian cigarettes that come in flavors such as vanilla kreteks are a kind of clove cigarette
it has been a long time since janet kalven slept in a stall in a cow barn or pumped water for bathing grailville the women's spiritual and educational center that she helped establish and where she has lived for much of the last 55 years has grown a lot less primitive but its basic vision is unchanged she said
when we first settled on this farm we shared a vision of changing the world through spiritual renewal said ms kalven 86 grailville was to be a countercultural oasis where we integrated manual and intellectual work with spiritual deepening and that is still true today even though we've adapted to changing times
ms kalven was 31 years old when she and 13 other women settled on the 183-acre farm in the rural community of loveland in 1944 the women belonged to the grail an organization of roman catholic lay women founded in the netherlands in 1921 and dedicated to promoting religious and social change it spread to the united states with a temporary center set up in chicago in 1940
four years later a member's inheritance and a loan from the cincinnati archdiocese provided the $49250 to purchase the farm at loveland about 20 miles northeast of cincinnati the rolling acres of fields woods ponds and creeks surrounding a three-story victorian mansion and numerous outbuildings became the grail's national home
we moved the animals out of the barns and ourselves in i lived the first summer in a box stall 45 by 110 feet said ms kalven we all shared one shower in the main house which was the only building with plumbing and central heating
the group also used outdoor privies and fashioned orange crates into shelves and washstands over time the buildings were transformed into meeting rooms and living quarters
for years the private nonprofit center remained mostly self-sufficient with as many as 100 women in residence at times they raised dairy and beef cattle chickens corn and wheat and maintained vegetable gardens and an orchard
catholic rituals prayer meditation study and manual labor made up the daily routine but with the societal shifts brought by the 1960s some grailville women saw communal living as less attractive than other newly available opportunities for bringing social change
the growing interest in civil rights women's rights and the antiwar movement combined with major changes in the catholic church affected us greatly said ms kalven
it was difficult to see friends leave - that was very hard she added her voice catching with emotion but we survived
over the next three decades grail membership was opened up to women of other faiths and more married women and divorced women became involved the grail which now numbers about 1000 members in 21 countries also became more vocal on global issues such as peace social justice women's rights and ecology
grailville now consists of 300 acres and 18 buildings while only six women live at grailville 40 to 50 grail members living in the region take part in its programs
most of grailville's income comes from sales at its bookstore and gardens lease payments for the farmland and fees for conferences and retreats
grailville attracts groups and individuals from all over the world said director karen zerhusen i think they are drawn not only by the peace and tranquility of the surrounding nature but also by the energy that seems to flow throughout this place
one of many organizations that have held conferences at grailville is cincinnati-based procter &amp gamble co a group of p&ampg women sales executives who met there gave grailville high marks said chuck moore a company official
it allowed them to ratchet-down the adrenaline flow and get away from their cell phones and other distractions said moore at grailville they could get to know and support each other better while working and reflecting on bigger issues
the cream-colored victorian mansion with its high ceilings stained wood floors and glass-walled dining room still serves as the centerpiece grailville can accommodate about 70 people overnight and up to 150 for day meetings ms zerhusen said
the gardens are now completely chemical-free and grailville sells an increasing amount of its organic produce to area restaurants community-oriented programs such as the women's resource center which provides transportation clothing and other support services to lower-income women attempting to find jobs are also thriving
i have been a divorced single mom for 10 years and one of the things that drew me to the grail was the support i received said resource center director lynn louchart-kiefer the energy that flows when women come together here is great they encourage your dreams and aspirations
ms kalven agreed the utopian community may be gone she said but the intensity of spirit that has sustained us through the years is still here
the state legislature's top republican wants the state to pick up the extra costs facing counties from new york's expanded health plan for the poor approved in december
state senate majority leader joseph bruno said thursday that his plan would save the state's 57 counties and new york city $340 million over the next three years bruno called it a property taxpayer relief proposal
when the state adopted its family health plus program in december bruno and assembly speaker sheldon silver a democrat had lobbied for the state to pick up any extra cost that might be charged to the counties and new york city they were rebuffed by republican gov george pataki
under the state's medicaid rules the federal government picks up 50 percent of the cost of such programs while the state and its counties including new york city each cover 25 percent
pataki aides had argued in december that the counties could cover the extra costs by dipping into their share of the national tobacco settlement and from their savings under medicaid cost-containment provisions that were being extended as part of the health package the counties had argued they wanted to use the tobacco money for other purposes
bruno said thursday that he felt the extra costs for the state could be financed as part of the new state budget that is for the state fiscal year that begins april 1 the senate leader said his proposal would be part of the budget negotiations
pataki in florida on thursday for the start of a three-day fund-raising trip to benefit his campaign committee issued a statement that seemed to kick sand on bruno's proposal the governor reiterated the savings from medicaid cost-containment for the counties and the tobacco settlement money they would be getting
i will work to ensure the adopted budget continues to provide record tax relief for new yorkers while protecting the state's fiscal integrity pataki's statement said
for his part bruno repeatedly sidestepped questions about whether he and the governor usually political allies were at odds over the proposal
you're trying to get me to pick a fight with the governor bruno said the governor and i are buddies and partners and this is the year of love not war
bruno conceded that with all 211 legislative seats up for election this year a proposal like his might have extra appeal to lawmakers
certainly in an election year it's a hell of a lot nicer to be cutting taxes than the alternative the senate leader said
under the bruno plan new york city would save $200 million over the next three years while the state's remaining 57 counties would save $140 million the expanded health program expires after three years unless it is extended by the legislature and governor
a spokeswoman for silver said thursday that he still supported relieving counties of the extra costs
a federal judge might be sen john mccain's last hope to run in the new york republican presidential primary in most of the state
an albany county judge on thursday threw the arizona senator off the march 7 ballot in eight of the state's congressional districts saying mccain didn't get enough gop signatures to compete in those districts if the decision stands mccain's name will not be on the republican presidential ballot in a fourth of the state's districts
however mccain's lawyers planned today to ask a federal judge in brooklyn to put mccain on the ballot in all 31 of the state's districts
we all know that i'm a qualified candidate mccain told reporters after a town hall meeting at nashua high school in new hampshire
he said he would take the issue to the floor of the republican national convention in philadelphia this summer if the courts fail to satisfy him
new york election laws are generally considered the nation's most arcane but cannizzaro disagreed calling the signature requirements reasonable
supreme court justice joseph cannizzaro late thursday overturned the state board of elections' decision to allow mccain to compete in the challenged districts despite challenges from state republicans most of whom support gop front-runner george w bush
in the challenged districts the arizona senator did not have the number of signatures on his presidential petitions to qualify for the state primary however mccain supporters argued that since he was a valid national presidential primary contender the signature requirement should not apply to him
new york election laws are generally considered the nation's most arcane but cannizzaro disagreed calling the signature requirements reasonable
it is not the prerogative of any single candidate to interpose his or her own judgment in place of that of the state legislature in this regard the judge said
gop candidates must get a certain number of signatures from party members to qualify for separate convention delegate slates in each of the state's 31 congressional districts in effect there are 31 separate gop primaries in new york
bush supporters had challenged mccain in 16 of those districts cannizzaro's decision leaves mccain off the ballot in a fourth of the state's districts
jeff buley a state republican committee lawyer working in support of bush cheered the decision we're pleased and think it was the proper decision he said
mccain's campaign lawyer henry berger said they had not yet decided whether to appeal cannizzaro's decision
we are disappointed berger said thursday but i'm going to see what happens in federal court tomorrow and then make a decision whether to appeal
with polls showing mccain running ahead of bush in new hampshire the battle over the new york primary ballot has become even more important
democrats helped mccain stay on the ballot in those eight districts the two republican members of the state board of elections had voted on wednesday to uphold the challenges to mccain's petitions
but the board's two democrats abstained thus depriving the bush camp of the third vote it needed to have the petitions invalidated for a lack of signatures
there was no clear indication thursday when the ballot for new york's march 7 primary would be final the state board had hoped to complete the ballot by monday
cannizzaro's decision is part of the battle over new york's march 7 presidential primary
developer donald trump won the right to compete for independence party backing and steve forbes lost his spot on the republican ballot in three long island congressional districts
trump who is not an announced presidential candidate is considering running for the reform party's presidential nomination his new york supporters who operate as the independence party are seeking to run delegate slates for him in the march 7 primary
but a coalition within the independence party has been trying to have trump's delegates thrown off the ballot the democracy coalition supports trump's nemesis and reform presidential candidate pat buchanan
in retaliation for the long island challenge to his petitions forbes is seeking a court order to remove frontrunner george w bush from the gop ballot in six districts in new york city
al gore looking to bolster his standing with an increasingly politically active constituency is boasting of having more openly gay potential convention delegates in new york than bill bradley does
on thursday the gore camp said that its slate of delegates for the state's march 7 democratic presidential primary included 11 openly gay candidates while slates for the former senator from new jersey had just five openly gay people
but within a few hours the gore campaign was wiping egg off its face after state party officials said the bradley campaign had reported having seven openly gay prospective delegates not five as gore had claimed
the al gore campaign continues to distort the facts in an attempt to win the democratic primary against senator bill bradley at any cost - even the cost of the truth the bradley campaign said in a statement the staff accused the gore campaign of lies and distortions
the bradley camp noted that the former senator had proposed expanding the 1964 civil rights act to include protections for gays and lesbians a move gore has opposed
peter ragone a spokesman for gore's new york campaign team conceded the mistake in the number of openly gay delegates bradley had ragone said the error was the result of incorrect information given the gore campaign by the state party
meanwhile a new statewide poll showed gore ahead of bradley among likely democratic new york primary voters on the republican side texas gov george w bush had a 2-1 lead over his closest rival sen john mccain among likely gop primary voters
the gore forces staged a news conference on the steps of city hall in new york city to boast about the number of openly gay delegates the vice president was running in new york
vice president gore has shown a commitment to lesbian and gay equality that senator bradley's record does not reflect said thomas duane a manhattan democrat and the only openly gay member of the state senate
the gore camp continued to maintain that bradley's proposal to replace medicaid with subsidies that would allow people to buy health insurance could put millions of new yorkers especially those living with aids in jeopardy
the bradley camp reacted sharply saying the bradley health plan would provide continued benefits for aids sufferers
this is an outrageous and misleading attack from the gore campaign bradley delegate contender daniel o'donnell the openly gay brother of rosie o'donnell said
a breakdown of delegates by ethnicity supplied by the campaigns to the state party showed 25 percent of the vice president's proposed delegates were black compared to 23 percent for bradley hispanics were 11 percent of gore's delegate slates to 9 percent for bradley
manhattanville college's poll found gore leading bradley 48 percent to 34 percent among likely democratic primary voters among likely republican voters bush led mccain 53 percent to 27 percent with steve forbes trailing at 7 percent
a statewide poll out earlier this month from the quinnipiac college polling institute had gore at 44 percent to 39 percent for bradley a former star with the new york knicks basketball team in that poll bush led mccain 47 percent to 38 percent
in the manhattanville poll 43 percent of democratic voters said they felt gore would wind up as the next president while one in three of them said bush would be the next to occupy the white house among likely republican primary voters 68 percent said bush would be the next president while just 10 percent said gore would win the white house
manhattanville college's telephone poll of 507 democrats and 302 republicans was conducted jan 20-23 the margin of error for the democratic sample is plus or minus 45 percentage points and 6 percentage points for the republican sample
reserve david shelton scored 21 points thursday night and no 13 tulsa beat texas-el paso 89-71 to become the first division i team to win 20 games this season
tony heard added 16 points eric coley scored 14 and greg harrington had 12 for tulsa 20-1 5-0 western athletic conference which extended its winning streak to 13 shelton was 7-of-12 from the field 6-of-8 from the free throw line and pulled down eight rebounds
duke was last season's first 20-game winner reaching the figure on the same date as tulsa with an 89-77 victory over north carolina that gave the blue devils a 20-1 record
utep 10-8 1-4 got within 56-50 with 1052 left in the game but missed 11 free throws and committed 16 turnovers in the second half
jarvis mullahon had 18 points for utep which shot 524 percent from the field while brandon wolfram added 14 and william smith had 13
jose escobedo of utep went 1-for-6 from the line in the second half
tulsa finished with a 29-24 rebound advantage
for all its apparent precision spelled out across hundreds of pages of facts figures and legalese a state budget is a slippery document
appropriations are authorized but money unspent positions in the state workforce are created but not filled
and municipal governments around new york are due to get more than $303 billion in the 2000-01 budget through the state revenue-sharing aid program
that is another sort of fiscal fish tale spun by albany budgeteers the notion that the state will share 8 percent of its general fund revenues with municipalities with no strings attached
revenue-sharing is the aid of choice among local officials because they can use it for anything street sweeping street people street festivals it makes no difference just count heads locally and line up for the checks based on how many people live in a town village or city
but the 8 percent figure is a mirage gov george pataki actually wants state revenue-sharing aid to be $5505 million for the fiscal year which begins april 1 that is about 14 percent of the general fund
the state budget eventually enacted by the state legislature and the governor will contain language superseding the 8 percent-of-general-fund stipulation with the lump sum
the legislature for a time actually rescinded the 8 percent rule pending possible changes to the delivery of general aid to localities but those changes were not enacted and the stipulation has technically gone back into effect just to be ignored for another year
the whole exercise is a little dishonest rome mayor joseph griffo said
revenue-sharing is a matter of good faith he said there is a formula in place and the state has neglected it to keep it on the books and to neglect it is offensive to local leaders
the head of the state conference of mayors and municipal officials edward farrell said mayors see the state with billions of dollars in recent surplus reserves and find it appalling that local governments have not gotten more revenue-sharing money
the underfunding of revenue sharing - the state's original property tax relief program - is a primary factor in new york's dubious distinction as having the nation's highest property tax burden he told a legislative hearing in albany this week
proponents of revenue-sharing aid have drawn a link between the funds and easing the local property tax burden since the aid program first emerged in 1946 at that time it was called per capita aid former gov nelson rockefeller noted in a budget address two decades later that the feeling was widespread in albany when per capita aid was created that local officials needed the flexibility offered by revenue sharing to cope with widely varying challenges be they the delivery of services in booming suburban areas or stemming the deterioration of urban centers
so sacrosanct was revenue-sharing that in perhaps the tightest budget of the last half of the 20th century in new york - for fiscal 1975-76 with possible bankruptcy hanging over both new york city and the state - former gov hugh carey still boosted revenue-sharing aid by $87 million
the high-water mark for the program came in the late 1980s when nearly $1 billion a year went to localities under revenue sharing - though by that time the governor and legislature were routinely ignoring the 8 percent stipulation
faced with closing a budget gap of some $7 billion however former gov mario cuomo dealt a thunderbolt to local leaders by championing a revenue-sharing reduction in fiscal 1991-92 of $410 million officials in that administration were surprised to find few state legislators willing to fiercely oppose the cut to the revenue-sharing program amid all of the other layoffs and cost-saving moves advocated by cuomo
pataki has sweetened revenue-sharing a bit from $529 million in 1995-96 when he ignored a promise cuomo made to raise revenue-sharing by 10 percent to the proposed $5505 million this year
to be fair griffo said pataki and the legislature have developed other general-purpose aid programs to municipalities such as the supplemental municipal aid program as well as more targeted programs for the most distressed cities last year state leaders committed to accelerating the payment of about $150 million in revenue-sharing to cities and since pataki became governor his budget aides say local governments have enjoyed some $33 billion in cost containment measures
in all more than $700 million in general purpose aid will be available to localities if pataki's budget becomes law pataki aides say that is nearly 25 percent more than when he took office in 1995
finally the pataki administration argues it and the legislature have embarked on the kind of meaningful reductions in local property taxes through the star program that most local governments were not able to achieve when they were getting twice as much revenue-sharing aid
but the billions of dollars in lost aid during the last decade remains on the minds of many local officials
i think - i know - it is just frustration from urban leaders saying the problems are centered here and we still need to do more griffo said

the state legislature's top republican wants the state to pick up the extra costs facing counties from new york's expanded health plan for the poor approved in december
state senate majority leader joseph bruno said thursday that his plan would save the state's 57 counties and new york city $340 million over the next three years bruno called it a property taxpayer relief proposal
when the state adopted its family health plus program in december bruno and assembly speaker sheldon silver a democrat had lobbied for the state to pick up any extra cost that might be charged to the counties and new york city they were rebuffed by republican gov george pataki
under the state's medicaid rules the federal government picks up 50 percent of the cost of such programs while the state and its counties including new york city each cover 25 percent

a key witness in a 1973 murder trial says a police detective used various terror tactics to force him to lie on the stand once by spinning the barrel of his gun as they sat in a jail cell
wayne wright was one of two teen-age runaways whose testimony helped lead to the convictions of two prostitutes for the murder of timothy haworth 52 a philadelphia businessman who was battered and strangled in a rochester alley on may 25 1973
at the retrial of john duval whose conviction was overturned last spring after he'd spent 25 years in prison wright testified thursday that chief detective william mahoney beat him in custody and threatened to charge him with murder if he didn't testify against duval
on one occasion a day before he was to appear in court wright said the detective nudged him awake in a jail cell and pulled out his revolver
he was just sitting there spinning the barrel of his revolver and asking if you know what you're going to say on the stand wright recounted
i got up on the stand and regurgitated what they police fed into me he added during cross-examination
duval and fellow prostitute betty tyson got 25 years to life imprisonment in the absence of physical evidence they were convicted of murder on the basis of confessions they insist were beaten out of them by mahoney and on the testimony on the two teens
prosecutor joe curran pointed out that wright took an oath at trial in which he swore to tell the truth during his testimony in 1973 wright also denied that he'd been beaten or threatened by police curran noted
wright spent seven months in jail as a material witness after the trial he ran up a string of convictions for prostitution and robbery in california he began rebuilding his life here in the mid-1980s and retracted his testimony in late 1997
the convictions were overturned a few months later when prosecutors came upon a buried synopsis of a police interview with the other teen jon jackson in which he denied seeing duval or tyson with the victim - contrary to what the teens had testified at trial
mahoney investigated at least 10 times for allegedly abusing suspects resigned in 1980 after he was found guilty of fabricating evidence in an unrelated case he died of heart failure in 1981 at age 55
prosecutors decided not to retry tyson - the city gave her $12 million in compensation - but went after duval again while tyson had steadfastly maintained her innocence duval had twice admitted his guilt before a parole board he says he lied because he didn't think he would be freed until he admitted guilt

syracuse ny ap - a state attorney continued to raise questions about the accuracy of a federal appraiser's $335 million valuation in the cayuga indian nation land claim during a second-day of cross-examination
at one point assistant attorney general david roberts tried to suggest that federal appraiser arvel hale had breached accepted professional standards by allowing the federal government's attorneys to dictate how the appraisal would be conducted
isn't it misleading to give an opinion because a lawyer told you roberts said as the damages trial concluded its fourth day thursday
during his four days on the witness stand hale has testified that the 64015 acres new york illegally acquired from the cayugas two centuries ago has a present-day market value of $2647 million additionally the cayugas should receive $704 million for the use and occupancy of that land over 204 years hale has said
roberts has tried to show the nine-member jury that the appraisal was grossly inflated
focusing on the data hale collected from the late 1700s and early 1800s roberts questioned the sample sizes hale used to derive the land's current fair-market value and his use of property outside the claim area which is located around the northern shore of cayuga lake in seneca and cayuga counties
hale told jurors that more than 60 percent of the property he analyzed was inside the claim area although he admitted that some lots he looked at were as far as 50 miles away
roberts also said that hale's approach did not account for improvements made to the land to make it more cultivable or buildings or structures that would have increased property values
for the first hundred years i did not consider those things hale said
us district judge neal mccurn previously ruled that appraisers were not to consider any private improvements buildings or structures when determining the land's value although they could consider roads utilities and other public infrastructure
you don't know one way or the other if any of these properties had buildings roberts said
hale admitted he did not but added that his analysis used only parcels of 20 acres or more because any structures would have minimal impact on the value of a larger lot
roberts also tried to show that hale's appraisal was bloated because he added value for infrastructure without deducting acreage for the space the infrastructure took up
later roberts turned his questioning to electronic and written correspondences between hale and federal attorneys in those documents hale used the word summation and referred to appraising tracts and parcels of land mccurn also directed that the claim area be appraised as one single tract
so what you are doing in your analysis is not appraising a single tract but a summation of existing parcels correct roberts asked
no hale said repeating that he had appraised the claim area as one single tract even though the land is divided into nearly 5700 separate parcels
roberts said he expected to finish his cross-examination of hale friday once roberts is finished hale will be questioned again by federal lawyers and will then likely face another round of queries from roberts
after hale is finished the state will begin presenting its witnesses including its own appraiser who has said the cayugas should receive no more than $46 million as compensation

last january the monica lewinsky scandal still swirled as hillary rodham clinton watched her husband's state of the union speech seated next to her was slugger sammy sosa of the chicago cubs for whom the first lady rooted while growing up in suburban chicago
this year she is an ardent new york yankee fan and owner of a $17 million home north of new york city that will serve as a base for her senate campaign
mrs clinton is raising millions of dollars to take on new york city mayor rudolph giuliani in what is shaping up as one of the nation's top political contests this year
as her husband delivers his last state of the union mrs clinton's political career is just beginning
she has moved out of the white house and into the home in chappaqua ny in a sign of just how much things have changed she commuted to washington for her husband's address from fund-raisers for her own campaign in south florida
president clinton paid tribute to his wife in his speech praising her work to streamline adoption and foster care programs
of course i am forever grateful to the person who has led our efforts from the beginning and who has worked so tirelessly for children and families for 30 years now my wife hillary he said
mrs clinton smiled at her husband and mouthed thank you' as she stood to acknowledge applause from her front-row seat in the visitors gallery the president applauded with the crowd for his wife who sat between daughter chelsea and home run king hank aaron
he also called on the entertainment industry to accept the first lady's challenge and to develop a single voluntary rating system for all children's entertainment that would be less confusing to parents
mrs clinton is drawing heavily from hollywood and the entertainment industry in her fund raising
the president focused his speech on broad issues such as ambitious plans to spend more to improve health care and education - some of the same issues mrs clinton will make key in her senate campaign
one of the specific initiatives the president mentioned - making college tuition tax deductible - first was advanced by democratic rep charles schumer of new york in his successful bid to oust gop sen alfonse damato in 1998
mrs clinton too is expected to campaign on that issue as she tries to appeal to some of the same middle-class suburban voters who helped schumer get elected
if she is successful in her bid for office the first lady will trade in her coveted seat in the gallery for a spot on the crowded house floor she now overlooks there she will be elbow-to-elbow with some of the same lawmakers who voted to impeach her husband

the third race of the america's cup challenger finals was postponed friday because of light winds continuing the weather problems that have plagued the competition between americaone and prada of italy
the best-of-9 series tied 1-1 is scheduled to resume saturday
the race committee postponed friday's race 1 hour and 25 minutes after its scheduled start of 115 pm local time
for a race to begin a breeze of at least five knots over a 10-minute period must be measured and its direction must be relatively constant but during the 85-minute wait the wind on the hauraki gulf was stronger than five knots for just a few minutes and the direction shifted dramatically
the boats were already on the course when the race was postponed at 240 pm while their boats bobbed around in the placid waters crew members relaxed
americaone skipper paul cayard lay down on the deck his hands behind his head other sailors chatted and laughed waiting for the race committee's decision
america's cup sailors use some sophisticated technology to gauge the speed and pressure of the wind - anemometers barometers and birds
until 10 minutes before the race the yachts are allowed to receive data from their weather boats after that they're on their own instruments on the mast feed data into a laptop computer on board
sometimes though crew members use other sources
they'll watch the way birds are flying bob mcdavitt of the metropolitan weather service of auckland said friday they'll see what helicopters are doing in the sky because quite often the choppers need to face the wind to steady themselves so that tells you what the weather is like that high in the air
better sailing conditions were forecast for saturday a northerly breeze from 10 to 20 knots
the series had been scheduled to begin last tuesday but was delayed for 24 hours by heavy seas strong winds and a rainstorm that limited visibility
it did start wednesday when prada won by 24 seconds in moderate winds that ranged from 10 to 14 knots
the sailors awoke thursday to rain and lighter winds the rain stopped but the third race was delayed by 65 minutes until the breeze picked up prada appeared headed for another victory leading by 149 after the first of six legs
but americaone came back to win by 133 in a race in which the shifting winds caused problems for sailors and spectators
because three legs of the race must be sailed as directly upwind as possible and the other three directly downwind the committee had to change the course as the wind shifted after the race began
that meant boats in the spectator fleet which originally were outside the course ended up in the middle of it before being ushered away by boats assigned to that job
however skippers paul cayard of americaone and francesco de angelis of prada each steered their yachts into the spectator fleet once a move that may have hurt prada because of the wash kicked up by the wayward boats
barring further postponements races 4 and 5 will be held sunday and tuesday no racing is scheduled monday with the sixth race set for wednesday
if the series goes to nine races it would not end until next saturday feb 5
the best-of-9 america's cup finals against defending champion new zealand are scheduled to start feb 19
state gambling regulators have settled long-standing disputes with the owner of a bridgeport greyhound track in an agreement that keeps the track open but removes the owner's gaming license
the gaming policy board reached the negotiated agreement thursday with robert zeff it allows him to transfer ownership of the shoreline star greyhound park to wife susan zeff who can run the track under her license
zeff can reapply for a license in two years and will be required to undergo a background check as far back as the summer of 1999 the agreement states over the next two years zeff will be barred from the track property
zeff was accused of taking a former gambling regulator on a junket to las vegas and of interfering with state police on a raid at his westport home in 1996 the agreement does not require zeff to admit any wrongdoing but requires him to donate $75000 to bridgeport charities
throughout this process i have maintained that i engaged in no inappropriate behavior or violation of any state gaming rules or regulations zeff said in a written statement
he said that some of his actions may have created a contrary perception and it is for this reason that i accepted the settlement that has been reached
zeff's problems with gambling regulators began when he tried to avoid a new background check when he wanted to convert his jai alai fronton into a greyhound track state law requires applicants to pay for the background checks and zeff said he wanted to avoid that expense
just after the gaming policy board voted against requiring a new background check zeff and former board chairman francis muska boarded a plane together for las vegas - a violation of rules that bar contact between regulators and the people they regulate
the state ethics commission fined muska $2000 for accepting a limousine ride and a hotel room from zeff the commission fined zeff $15000 for the muska incident and for faulty record-keeping of his lobbying activities
state police arrested zeff after he threw about 100 audio tapes over a fence when police arrived with a warrant to search his home the tapes had been secretly made using a hidden tape recorder in his briefcase
charges of interfering with police and destroying evidence were dropped after zeff completed probation requirements
a 20-year-old man has been convicted of manslaughter with a firearm in the 1998 shooting death of a teen-ager outside a house party in plainfield
ryan thompson had been charged with murder but was convicted of manslaughter thursday after deliberations that began two weeks ago but had been interrupted three times by weather and illness
the jury found thompson acted with extreme indifference but did not find an intent to kill which is required for a murder conviction
thompson could have been sentenced to up to 60 years in prison if convicted of murder in the april 18 1998 death of rob mccaffery he rejected a plea bargain that would have allowed him to plead guilty to manslaughter in return for a 17-year sentence
he now faces up to 40 years in prison when he is sentenced march 23
prosecutors say thompson was not invited to the party and became involved in a fight with several guests before the shooting occurred mccaffery 17 was shot while sitting on the roof of a garage watching the altercation authorities say
the five-week trial was marked by questions over the tactics of state police detectives who interviewed thompson and key witnesses several of whom said they were prevented from recanting statements implicating thompson
state police admitted that even after thompson's trial had started they were investigating whether another person fired the fatal shot
prosecutor mark solak defended the state police saying the verdict validates their investigation
the state police as always conducted a superb investigation which resulted in justice being done he said
as the verdict was read thompson 20 stood straight-backed his parents scott and jane thompson fought back tears as they huddled on a bench behind him the two have stood behind their son vocally maintaining his innocence and writing letters to high-ranking officials - even to the governor - citing what they see as the biased nature of the investigation
scott thompson said later that he planned to visit his son thursday night in corrigan correctional institution
what do you say to an innocent person who's just been voted guilty by a jury he asked

with a cautious tone the government announced that smoking among high schoolers has dropped for the first time since it began tracking the age group in 1991
a nationwide survey of 7529 high schoolers in september and october found that 284 percent said they had smoked in the last month 8 percent fewer than the last survey in 1997 the us centers for disease control and prevention said thursday
however the report also showed that nearly one in 10 children have smoked cigarettes by the time they reach middle school
nine percent of students in grades six through eight said they had smoked cigarettes and nearly 13 percent - one in every eight students - said they had used some sort of tobacco product including chewing tobacco pipes and cigars
the survey was the first in which the cdc surveyed an equal number of middle school students and high schoolers
i don't think it was that surprising because we see such high rates in high school that we know it begins in middle school we just didn't know at what level said michael eriksen director of the cdc's office on smoking and health
in 1997 the last time the cdc looked at high school smoking 364 percent of students said they had smoked in the preceding month at the time teen smoking was on the rise from 348 percent in 1995 and 275 percent in 1991 the first year the cdc started keeping track
the cdc said it expected teen smoking rates to drop - just not by so much the agency said differences between the 1999 survey and earlier studies may have exaggerated the decline
we may have peaked in terms of smoking rates among high school students eriksen said
the drop in smoking rates had been expected because tobacco companies raised cigarette prices about 45 cents per pack last year to help pay for a $206 billion settlement with 46 states over lawsuits filed by attorneys general the industry previously settled for $40 billion with the other states
as part of the larger settlement billboard ads for cigarettes were banned and the tobacco industry was barred from running advertisements with cartoon characters such as joe camel that anti-smoking activists say are aimed at youngsters in many places cigarette billboards have been replaced by signs with anti-smoking messages
ron todd director of tobacco control for the american cancer society agreed that higher cigarette prices should result in fewer smokers of high school age
although he said the cdc's numbers surprised him it still says more than one-in-four children in high school are smoking cigarettes and that's not good enough todd said while the news is encouraging we want it to be better
the questions used in the surveys and the one in 1997 were the same said wick warren a cdc statistician but response rates varied about 90 percent of schools responded to the 1999 tobacco survey the earlier surveys which also included questions about sex got responses from about 75 percent of schools
the study also found that the wide gap in smoking rates between white and black high school students does not exist among middle-schoolers
the proportion of blacks smoking in high school was nearly 16 percent - half the percentage of white smokers but in middle school both racial groups were about 9 percent
though it is too soon to tell this could signal the end of a 25-year trend in which blacks started smoking later than whites
two trendy types of imported cigarettes - bidis and kreteks - are being smoked by about 5 percent of high schoolers and 2 percent of middle-schoolers that makes them almost as popular as chewing tobacco
bidis are skinny unfiltered indian cigarettes that come in flavors such as vanilla kreteks are a kind of clove cigarette
burger king plans to run national ads next week publicizing a second recall of its pokemon toy balls after a 4-month-old indianapolis boy suffocated in his crib on one of the toys
the miami-based restaurant chain's announcement came thursday hours after the consumer product safety commission issued its second nationwide alert in a month about the dangers posed by poke balls
more than 25 million of the toys were handed out with burger king children's meals late last year the packaging contained no warnings and described them as safety tested and recommended for all ages
zachary jones was the second infant to suffocate when half of the hollow ball about the size of a tennis ball covered his mouth and nose he died tuesday
another plastic ball was blamed for the suffocation death of a 13-month-old california girl in december
burger king said it will start running 15-second television advertisements on tuesday warning parents about the toys the ads will run for one week on all major networks and more than 20 cable outlets spokeswoman kim miller said
the consumer alert says parents should immediately take the balls away from children under the age of 3 they should discard the ball or return both halves of the ball and the clip to a burger king restaurant for a free order of fries
the pokemon toys were safety tested only for choking not for suffocation burger king spokesman charles nicolas said it's not an industry practice to test for suffocation
when the recall was first announced dec 27 burger king placed an ad in usa today posted signs in its restaurants and sent out notices to 56000 pediatricians it had also put the recall announcement on its tray liners and carryout bags
gov george ryan says he has learned a lesson watching federal prosecutors chalk up convictions in a bribes-for-licenses scandal during his time as secretary of state
ryan apologized thursday for corruption in the secretary of state's office which he headed before becoming governor a year ago
workers in the office have admitted taking bribes in exchange for granting drivers licenses to unqualified people the workers donated some of the bribe money to ryan's campaigns
a federal grand jury investigation has led to the indictments of 28 people seventeen have pleaded guilty
i'm angered because this corruption case has overshadowed the good things that we've done in the office the republican governor said at a news conference i'm angry at myself for not recognizing the problem a lot earlier
ryan has not been named as a target of the investigation and has repeatedly denied having any knowledge that his employees were collecting cash in exchange for fixing driver's license tests
the governor said he believes his campaigns were given around $150000 by bribe-takers he said he has donated about $90000 to charity to make up for the tainted donations and will be giving more
ryan said he now sees that it was a mistake to let his government employees contribute to his campaigns ryan stopped taking such contributions once he became governor and said he may pursue legislation to ban the practice throughout state government
this has been a very difficult lesson for me but i've learned it and i've learned it very well ryan said
attorneys for a former los alamos scientist accused of mishandling nuclear weapons secrets want to overturn a law that requires them to reveal details of their case to prosecutors before trial
attorneys for wen ho lee filed a motion wednesday to have parts of the classified information procedures act voided as unconstitutional
the law's interest in protecting national security cannot justify the burden on lee's rights his attorneys argued the defense team said the prosecution is under no obligation to disclose similar details of its case
criminal defendants generally do not have to reveal details of their defense to prosecutors before trial but the 1980 law demands such details it was passed to prevent someone accused of spying from disclosing so many secrets that prosecutors would find the case too damaging to the nation's security interests

speeders beware police are serious about the new reckless driving crackdown which can result in your car being seized
just ask peter ruggeri the brooklyn man was caught driving 117 miles per hour and was the first person to have his car seized under the new policy first deputy police commissioner patrick kelleher said thursday
ruggeri 38 was charged with reckless endangerment reckless driving and driving while intoxicated ruggeri faced a double whammy - under the city's dwi seizure policy any person charged with dwi automatically has their car seized if the vehicle belongs to him
the reckless driving crackdown which went into effect this month is similar to the dwi policy a motorist is slapped with reckless driving a misdemeanor charge when caught driving double the speed limit
also if a motorist is seen by an officer committing three hazardous driving violations - such as following too closely unsafe lane changing and driving in unauthorized lanes - he or she will be charged with reckless driving and other traffic violations
as with the dwi crackdown if the driver owns the car it will be seized and a person must be acquitted of the charges to get their car back however if someone other than the owner was driving the car it will be returned to the owner
ruggeri owns the blue 1988 buick lesabre he was driving kelleher said the reckless driving charge was for driving 117 mph in a 50 mph zone on the belt parkway police also felt ruggeri's actions were so indifferent to other motorists he was charged with reckless endangerment a felony punishable by up to seven years in prison
highway officers in a marked car spotted ruggeri at 240 am thursday as he was driving westbound on the highway the officers gave chase and ruggeri stopped soon after near an area where two people were killed earlier this month in a speeding accident kelleher said
ruggeri faces arraignment in brooklyn criminal court he has one previous speeding violation from 1997
inspector vincent kennedy head of the highway district said ruggeri's driving habits are not unique
it's a lot more common than i would like he said
kelleher added that taking away ruggeri's car was the right thing to do
this program is about getting people off the streets and taking their cars away from them if they don't show the responsibility to utilize them properly he said
henri matisse aging and infirm grips a struggling dove in one hand and sketches intensely with the other a shriveled old woman from cape cod celebrates the fourth of july with an american flag draped around her neck
familiar and still poignant decades after they were shot by henri cartier-bresson these images are among 90 black and white photographs on sale in what is being billed as the first ever commercial exhibit by france's most famous living photographer
widely credited with bringing the sensitive eye of a trained artist to photojournalism cartier-bresson 91 was on hand - somewhat reluctantly - for the vip opening at the claude bernard gallery in paris last week
the show which runs until feb 26 brings together cartier-bresson's most famous shots taken around the globe between 1932 and 1999
cartier-bresson turned his back on a lucrative family textile business to study art at the age of 20 he went on to found the legendary magnum photo agency in 1947 and became known for seemingly simple shots of ordinary people in ordinary situations
i never think about photography he told associated press television news in a rare interview
it's a way of recording what i see in an instant he said and he summed up his lifelong credo as gen charles de gaulle used to say aim well shoot fast and get the hell out'
the results are decisive moments - also the title of one of cartier-bresson's 12 books an elderly woman hand outstretched wears an american flag almost like an apron on july 4 1947 on cape cod an anonymous couple sunbathe their heads hidden behind a parasol on a rocky normandy beach
what's a picture cartier-bresson said clutching his cane what counts in photography is geometry a sense for form where everything is in place it's not trivial
the collection also features intimate portraits of some of the century's greatest intellectuals - samuel beckett jean-paul sartre alberto giacometti andre breton and albert camus among them
these photographs are little pieces of cartier-bresson's life said gallery owner claude bernard he was very close with these people
bernard said he and the photographer sorted through several thousand photographs before deciding on the final selection - and their price tags
he agreed to the sale because he wanted to share his work with the younger generation and for that reason he kept prices modest bernard said
prices range from $3000-$5700
among the highlights is behind the gare saint-lazare considered by many critics as his greatest photograph with its subtle contrast of geometrical forms and feeling of complete spontaneity
the photograph depicts a man leaping over a puddle and frozen in midair with his shadow forming a symmetrical v-shape contrasting to the circular forms in the water and the vertical fence above the railroad tracks
cartier-bresson has always shot with his trusty leica the quietest of cameras working only with black and white film and notably without a flash thrusting a subject in the limelight he said was a sure way to destroy it
he also opposes cropping pictures saying it dilutes their meaning
these days cartier-bresson spends his days either in his studio sketching live models or at his window capturing the street scenes he once photographed
drawing is meditation you can take your time he said you think with your fingers it's very dangerous to think with your brain that's rationalism when it comes to drawing sensuality is better it's sensitivity over sense
cartier-bresson however still keeps his camera handy two years ago at 89 he leaped out of a boat in venice to shoot a picture of a young woman drying her hair with a throng of young men around her
he was like a gazelle suddenly jumping off the boat and circling around the young woman until he could get exactly what he saw bernard recalled that's when i understood the magic of bresson
congo's rebels were not officially invited to this week's talks at the united nations on ending congo's 1 1/2-year war but they showed up anyway and the visit has revived hopes for a beleaguered peace deal
while african leaders such as congolese president laurent kabila stole the spotlight at the united nations leaders from two of the three rebel factions spent the week quietly meeting with african un and us officials in hotel suites around town trying to revive a cease-fire agreement signed last summer
those talks and public pledges by the half-dozen african leaders involved in the continent's most intractable dispute to recommit themselves to a cease-fire have left the rebels with a sense of hope that the agreement signed in lusaka zambia is still viable
without new york i think in some few months lusaka would be dead said bizima karaha intelligence chief for the main rebel faction the congolese rally for democracy new york has rescued the lusaka peace process
the rebels launched an insurrection in the eastern part of the vast central african country in august 1998 to oust kabila from power they signed the cease-fire accord with kabila and his allies - zimbabwe angola and namibia - in july but fighting has continued with both sides accusing each other of violations
in a bid to resurrect the failing peace process us ambassador richard holbrooke invited the key players to new york to recommit themselves to the cease-fire agreement so the united nations could move to deploy a mission of military observers to oversee implementation of the cease-fire
the rebels couldn't be invited officially to participate in the un talks because they don't represent a country but the united states let it be known that the rebels would be granted visas if they wanted to come
rebels and presidents alike praised the impetus given to the peace process by the new york talks - even though there were no concrete breakthroughs achieved
what we thought was very good was that there was some unity of viewpoints from the african leaders said ernest wamba dia wamba who leads a splinter faction of the main congolese rally for democracy
they made basically the same request on the un for rapid deployment for support and to give some push to the implementation of the lusaka agreement
the lusaka agreement calls for a cease-fire deployment of un peacekeepers and the withdrawal of all foreign forces from congo
the security council vowed wednesday to authorize deployment of the military observers quickly and to consider sending in a full-fledged peacekeeping force in the future
the united nations has recommended a core force of 500 observers be supplemented by 3400 security troops and other personnel for a total of 5500 people
karaha the rebel intelligence officer said he was optimistic that the security council would follow through and deploy and that kabila and his allies were being sincere when they recommitted themselves to the peace process
i am optimistic hopeful but careful karaha said because what happened here these are just good declarations of good intentions what determines the future in that country is what happens on the ground
kabila meanwhile managed to work in some business with all the talks on the lusaka accord chevron on thursday announced it would invest $75 million over three years in congo for a drilling program
the colonel's wife says she's a cocaine addict worse she admits smuggling drugs into the united states by mail from her husband's post in colombia
laurie anne hiett also claims col james hiett the former commander of the us army's anti-drug operation was in the dark about her bungled scheme
i never told him what i was doing hiett said thursday after pleading guilty to drug conspiracy charges in brooklyn federal court free on bond she faces up to 9 years in prison when she is sentenced on april 28
in a rambling interview with reporters hiett 36 clutched a copy of the self-help book emotional blackmail talked openly about battling a drug addiction and lamented making headlines while the united states is waging a costly war on drugs
there are people dying every day to fight this and then i did what i did she said i'm not proud of it i just truly apologize
hiett surrendered to federal authorities in august after they intercepted two 12-kilo packages of heroin that she mailed to queens and manhattan from a post office at the us embassy in bogota
the parcels had hiett's return address but she claimed she sent them for jorge ayala a civilian driver for us military commanders in colombia and that they contained books candy coffee and colombian artifacts
hiett pleaded innocent however in recent months hiett's miami attorney sought a plea bargain with prosecutors
a codefendant hernan arcila 54 pleaded guilty on jan 5 to drug conspiracy admitting that he accepted shipments from colombia at his queens address ayala who was also named in a 13-count indictment remains a fugitive
as part of her plea thursday hiett told magistrate marilyn go she shipped six packages from bogota to new york city believing they contained cocaine tests on the two seized shipments revealed they were heroin
the defendant admitted flying to new york city two times to collect drug proceeds in queens assistant us attorney lee dunst also said hiett once took another trip to miami carrying a half kilo of cocaine
an army investigation cleared col hiett saying he had no prior knowledge of the crimes the colonel has since been transferred to fort monroe va new york authorities are still investigating
hiett told reporters she purposely tried to keep her husband in the dark
at one point he may have asked me why i was going to new york said hiett who still lives with her husband and two young sons in virginia i just told him don't ask me
hiett told the judge she's battled a cocaine addiction for years but has been clean since her arrest she said her problem clouded her judgment
i have everything to lose she said when i look back i don't understand it myself it never occurred to me when i was doing it that my husband was in charge of all of that stuff i know it sounds crazy

scalabrine led the trojans with 18 points while bluthenthal added 17 points and nine rebounds and hair had 13 points nine on 3-pointers

tulsa was the preseason no 2 pick in the western athletic conference on thursday night the 13th-ranked golden hurricane became the first division i team to win 20 games ths season
we're on an emotional roller coaster ride right now and we feel we can compete with anyone in the country said reserve david shelton who scored 21 points in the 89-71 victory over texas-el paso
no one expected us to do this added tony heard who had 16 points we work very hard in practice and it's paying off during the games

with eric coley adding 14 points and greg harrington scoring 12 tulsa 20-1 5-0 extended its winning streak to 13 games shelton was 7-of-12 from the field 6-of-8 from the free throw line and pulled down eight rebounds as the golden hurricane won by 18 points just off their 205 average margin of victory which leads the country

the boom economy and last year's drought have combined to create a national shortage of ornamental trees and shrubs for home and commercial landscaping growers say
if i had 3000 trees i could sell them in one day said dan mooney a sales representative for robert w baker cos in west suffield conn he was among hundreds of participants at a nursery convention meeting in columbus this week
joe zampini of lake county nursery in northeast ohio said he had 15000 fewer trees to sell last summer after the drought pinched their growth
zampini said he has seen a lot of frustration over growers' inability to meet high demand after two consecutive years of drought in his part of the country
it may take anywhere from five to 10 years to recover to have enough product out there to recover for cities landscapers garden centers zampini said
powell dykes is a grower from mcminnville tenn which advertises itself as the nursery capital of the world boasting more than 400 nurseries in the town and surrounding warren county
the economy's been so good there's so much building going on people are buying everything they can get hold of dykes said
dozens of wholesale nursery growers from up and down the east coast and the midwest showed off their greenery at the three-day central environmental nursery trade show in columbus
many said they're still feeling the effects of last year's drought and won't know until summer - when trees have bloomed and put out leaves - the full extent of the damage
the most harm was to trees' growth trees that didn't grow enough weren't ready for sale worsening the shortage
but the economy is the real culprit they say
in the early 1990s a glut of ornamental trees pushed prices down from about $100 to $50 or $60 a tree said brian champion president of the ohio nursery and landscapers association
growers tired of giving the trees away or burning them cut back production now they can't provide enough said champion 35 of herman losely &amp sons inc in perry ohio
trees in especially high demand include shade trees such as maple oak and ash and several ornamental trees and shrubs including vibernums - a fragrant flowering shrub - crabapples and flowering trees such as service berry and magnolia
joel albizo spokesman for the washington dc-based american nursery &amp landscape association said the shortage has branched out to retailers as well
it's wonderful that people are coming into the garden center and buying that they have money to spend he said but it's not so wonderful if you don't have plants in the store
gretchen mallory a retail landscaper in columbus said dealing with the shortage means careful planning
you have to be more aware of what you can offer someone as a customer and what the cost is - you might be eating it because of the expense mallory said making the customer aware is half the battle be up front there is a shortage i think this would be the best for you but i'm going to have to find it'
meanwhile mallory has more to worry about than just the tree shortage
last year's drought has also caused a shortage of sod she said
republicans in congress cheered president clinton's proposal to cut taxes by $350 billion over the next decade but they said that should represent only the starting point given the enormous projected budget surplus
i think we can do more said senate finance committee chairman william roth r-del
clinton outlined a series of targeted tax proposals thursday night in his final state of the union address to congress but he cautioned that tax relief should occur without forsaking the path of fiscal discipline that led to the budget surplus the president also said lawmakers must not forget that social security and medicare face insolvency as baby boomers retire
indeed we must make these investments and tax cuts in the context of a balanced budget that strengthens and extends the life of social security and medicare and pays down the national debt clinton said
house speaker dennis hastert r-ill agreed with each of those points but added another we will not use the current surplus as an excuse to go on a government spending spree
tax cuts and how to use the huge projected budget surpluses are a hot political issue this year particularly for the republicans clinton's plan gives vice president al gore a tax cut to promote if he wins the democratic presidential nomination
texas gov george w bush the gop presidential frontrunner is pushing a five-year $483 billion tax cut while sen john mccain r-ariz proposes cutting taxes by $237 billion over five years
one gop priority embraced by clinton would partly fix a tax code glitch in which millions of two-income married couples pay more income taxes than if they were single clinton wants to gradually double the standard income tax deduction for married people cutting taxes for more than 9 million couples at a cost of $45 billion
republicans intend to move legislation dealing with the marriage penalty to the house floor by mid-february although it is likely to be broader in scope and also help married people who itemize their tax deductions
much of clinton's fiscal 2001 tax relief plan has been released over the past weeks including an expansion of the earned income tax credit for the working poor adjusting the minimum tax so it affects fewer middle-class people and credits or deductions for long-term health care college expenses and people who need health insurance
new items unveiled thursday include
retirement savings accounts for low-income families in which the government would provide a 2-for-1 match for the first $100 contributed by each person cost$54 billion
a package of tax breaks and incentives to encourage philanthropy including allowing non-itemizers to take a tax deduction for charitable giving another measure would be designed to make it easier to donate appreciated assets like stocks and real property cost$14 billion
increasing the dependent child care credit and extending it to parents who stay home with their children cost$30 billion
a tax credit for pharmaceutical companies that develop new vaccines against malaria tuberculosis and aids cost$1 billion
aides said the president will use some of the projected surplus to pay for the tax cuts but is also likely to advocate closing corporate tax loopholes and shelters - and possibly other tax increases - to foot roughly $100 billion of the cost similar proposals in the past have received a cool reception in congress
republicans said they also intend to push for abolition of inheritance taxes economic development credits in poor areas and savings accounts for college tuition among others they added that their tax cuts would be much larger than the president's
rep bill archer chairman of the house ways and means committee pointed out that clinton's proposals to ease the marriage penalty and to protect the middle class from the alternative minimum tax were similar to items in the $792 billion gop tax cut vetoed by the president last summer
congress fixed these problems last year and we will do so again this year and we hope the president won't veto tax relief again said archer r-texas
in their official reply to president clinton's state of the union address republicans joined the president in seeking improvements in health care and education while denying the need for further growth in government
the debate in washington is not about money it is about who makes the decisions we need a change of approach sen susan collins of maine said thursday night in arguing the gop approach to education reform
collins and fellow first-term sen bill frist of tennessee both known for working well with democrats generally took the high road in their 17-minute response to the president concentrating on the pluses of their proposals rather than the perceived minuses of the president's approach
other republicans were more direct in swiping at clinton's big-dollar solutions as washington digs out of the latest winter blizzard the congress will dig out of an avalanche of presidential spending initiatives said house speaker dennis hastert r-ill
five years ago we put the nation on a fiscal diet and he tried to put all its weight back on in one night said rep mark foley r-fla
collins enumerated several top gop priorities - protecting social security eliminating the $36 trillion public debt in 15 years significant tax relief and a national missile defense system
but the former college administrator focused on differences in education policy republicans too will spend more on elementary and secondary education she said but want control of that money shifted to the local communities she said republicans will also increase federal grants to local communities for use in recruiting and training good teachers and would increase the amount families can contribute to education savings accounts
frist a heart-lung transplant surgeon said clinton's proposal to extend health insurance to more americans makes government even bigger and more bloated because each new program we heard about tonight - and there were about 11 of them in health care alone - comes with its own massive bureaucracy
he suggested that clinton was again leading the nation toward the national health care plan that congress rejected in 1993 he recalled working as a surgical fellow in england and said he learned that socialized medicine - whether in england or in canada where patients are fleeing to the united states for treatment - just do not work
republicans frist said would work to overhaul medicare pass a patients' rights bill that makes lawsuits against hmos a last resort and ensure that americans have choice and security in their health care alternatives
hastert earlier thursday also spoke of a republican plan to improve prescription drug coverage for the elderly
unlike clinton who has proposed creating a new medicare prescription drug plan open to all hastert said the gop would focus on helping the one-third of senior citizens who now lack access to or cannot afford private options tax credits and block grants to states were among the options he said
hollywood won't be the only industry with star power over the next few months
an unusually high number of big-name literary authors have new novels coming out including nobel laureate saul bellow and pulitzer prize winners philip roth john updike jane smiley and carol shields books also are expected from el doctorow susan sontag michael ondaatje joyce carol oates and mary mcgarry morris
there was a dearth of literary-commercial novels last fall said laurie brown vice president of marketing for farrar straus &amp giroux which is releasing the sontag novel this year there are a lot of candidates for front-page book reviews
bellow's novel ravelstein is his first full-length work of fiction in more than a decade it's based on his friendship with the late allan bloom a fellow professor at the university of chicago and author of a widely read attack on modern culture the closing of the american mind
the 84-year-old bellow winner of the nobel prize in 1976 also recently became a father for the fourth time his fifth wife janis freedman gave birth to naomi rose in december
roth's new novel the human stain has a scenario bloom might well have thought of an aging classics professor is forced to resign after being accused of racism updike's gertrude and claudius imagines what happened before act i of hamlet sontag's latest in america is set in part on a farming commune in the 19th century
doctorow best known for such historical novels as ragtime and billy bathgate at least begins his new novel in contemporary times city of god opens in manhattan in 1999 where a cross has disappeared from a downtown church and mysteriously landed on the roof of an upper west side synagogue
like hollywood studios publishers try to time releases so high-profile titles don't end up competing but this year so many prominent writers had novels ready that putting them out at the same time proved unavoidable
when writers like those deliver a book you publish it brown said thursday
publishers also look at commercial novels differently than they do literary ones audiences for updike or bellow are considered smaller but more dependable than those for tom clancy or michael crichton
when thomas harris came out last summer with hannibal his sequel to the silence of the lambs publishers adjusted their schedules for commercial books but a fan of bellow is considered likely to buy ravelstein regardless of whether roth has a book out
we do try to give each other a little space for the megasellers brown said but none of us look at literary books in the same way those authors have a more dedicated readership
the seemingly permanent residence of the harry potter stories at the top of bestseller lists has made it hard for literary writers to break in but at least a couple should make it this year
ondaatje's anil's ghost is his first novel since the widely acclaimed the english patient and has a first printing of 200000 smiley author of such bestsellers as a thousand acres and moo has a printing of 150000 for her novel about horse racing horse heaven
fans of commercial novels will also have plenty to choose from including new books from clancy faye kellerman patricia cornwell mary higgins clark barbara taylor bradford and the late harold robbins
and at least one other major literary name will appear on an upcoming book mailer but not norman the debut novel of his wife norris church mailer is due in may
some reaction to president clinton's state of the union address
the president's agenda will help sustain record economic growth by paying down the national debt by 2013 it will make prudent use of the surplus to extend the life of social security and medicare and to provide a fiscally responsible middle-class tax cut unfortunately republicans have no plans to use one penny of the surplus to strengthen social security or medicare - house minority leader richard gephardt
without the republican congress to block big government programs and higher taxes proposed by the clinton-gore administration we wouldn't have a balanced budget much less the surplus we have now - jim nicholson republican national committee chairman
just as we plan ahead to safeguard medicare and social security we need to plan for our natural security - saving land always stands the test of time - william meadows president of the wilderness society
 waiting for clinton's so-called marriage tax relief would be like waiting for food in a russian bread line - janet parshall spokeswoman for the family research council
the national debt is a serious matter republicans have supported paying off the debt by 2015 the administration by 2013 with the new surplus this is not a game of one-upmanship it is imperative that we take politics out of this and do what is best for the future of this nation - rep steven kuykendall r-calif
fortunately because of our founding fathers' foresight in creating a balance of power in our democracy congress will once again serve as the reality check for the president's kid in the candy store spending spree - rep steve largent r-okla
in medicare we are pleased that the president's proposal recognizes that it should be modernized with a prescription drug benefit that takes advantage of the advances in medicine likewise we welcome the proposal to expand health insurance coverage for working families and although the administration's proposal for a long-term care tax credit doesn't address every need it would certainly help many families - horace deets aarp executive director
this is the most comprehensive and significant package i've seen for promoting charitable giving it means more private resources will go to improving america's schools hospitals libraries and the like - dorothy ridings council on foundations president
parents teachers and school board members should be wary of the president's proposal to help them build new schools as usual the democrats' promise of free help' from washington comes with plenty of strings attached - rep joseph pitts r-pa
president clinton is partially right congress must pass health care reform legislation this year however his proposals to dramatically expand government-run health care are wrong-headed - rep john shadegg r-ariz
tonight president bill clinton gave the nation his wish list for this session of congress there are many things we can accomplish if the president decides to work with us but if the president is forced by house democrats to cast aside bipartisan cooperation in favor of election-year politics the result will be gridlock and a failed agenda - house speaker dennis hastert r-ill
the speech tonight was a distortion of the seriousness of this country's fiscal crisis we need to sober up and realize that there are no surpluses and won't be unless we get serious about controlling runaway spending and tax cuts the country can't afford - sen fritz hollings d-sc
the president appears to be on the verge of taking our hard-fought fiscal prosperity and throwing it away with both hands the president is proposing to spend budget surpluses which may or may not materialize faster than they can be counted - us chamber of commerce
clinton's health plan would cover at best 5 million of the 45 million uninsured that's less than the 7 million who have lost their insurance since he took office many because of his welfare reform - ida hellander physicians for a national health program director
the us is the richest country in the history of the world in the midst of an unprecedented economic boom - of course we should increase spending on education - bob peterson fifth grade teacher in milwaukee
russia has escaped a council of europe suspension for its conduct in chechnya but international pressure is growing on moscow to settle the bloody conflict
the council of europe handed russia a three-month deadline thursday to start cease-fire talks and ease the suffering of chechen civilians or face suspension from the human rights organization a suspension would be a blow to moscow's efforts to link itself more closely with europe
un secretary general kofi annan added his voice to calls for a speedy end to the war during his visit to moscow
while we all support efforts to rout out terrorists we should take every step to protect the rights of the civilians and ensure that they don't suffer undue hardship annan said thursday at the start of a three-day visit
russia contends its 5-month-old campaign against chechnya is aimed at rebels it considers to be terrorists
the international red cross also appealed for protection of chechen civilians reminding russians of their obligations under international humanitarian law notably to spare civilians and their property
the red cross statement from geneva switzerland estimated 20000-40000 civilians remain trapped in grozny the chechen capital which is under near constant bombardment from besieging russian troops
the city's remaining inhabitants are facing perilous conditions and have extremely limited access to food water medical care electricity or gas the statement said
the red cross also complained that it had not been granted access to prisoners being held by russian forces contrary to international agreements
the european union has also repeatedly condemned the chechen war but stopped short of imposing trade sanctions the 15-nation group did agree monday to suspend some $90 million in aid or redirect the money to humanitarian projects
the 41-nation council of europe the continent's leading human rights body decided against imposing immediate sanctions on moscow underscoring western european fears of leaving russia isolated and prone to anti-western sentiment
analysts said the threat of suspension from the council was taken very seriously in moscow and impacts on russian aspirations for closer ties with western institutions russia gained entry in 1996
it is a real point of pressure said peter bouckaert chechen specialist with human rights watch a private monitoring group we hope the council of europe will stick to its word
moscow dispatched foreign minister igor ivanov to the council's meeting where he heard the russian military operation firmly condemned
in his speech to the council ivanov denied russian troops in chechnya were using excessive force and said they were defending europe's common borders against a barbarian invasion of international terrorism
the assembly approved a motion demanding russia stop all indiscriminate and disproportionate military action halt attacks on civilians start cease-fire talks and improve access for humanitarian agencies news media and international observers
failure to meet the demands by assembly's next meeting in april will inevitably necessitate a review of russia's membership in the council of europe the motion said
despite the tough words the european legislators disappointed those hoping for swifter action against russia an amendment calling for the expulsion of the assembly's 36 russian members was soundly defeated another proposing suspension of the russians' voting rights narrowly failed to pass
an ap news analysis by tom raum associated press writer
washington ap - president clinton's final state of the union address was a tour de force of unfulfilled legislative dreams and projects the chances of his getting favorable action on much of this fountain of legislation in the republican-controlled congress in a presidential election year may be slim
but in emphasizing a look ahead instead of a look back clinton sought to frame issues for the upcoming election - and to give a boost to his choice of a successor vice president al gore
this strategy of course was not lost on republicans
the debate in washington is not about money it is about who makes the decisions sen susan collins r-maine observed in the gop rebuttal
republicans weren't overly anxious to buy in on a clinton-gore wish-list agenda
but many of clinton's proposals are popular ones - a prescription drug benefit for the elderly big spending increases for schools a $10000 tax deduction for college tuition and republicans don't want to be viewed as naysayers either
gop leaders awkwardly paused - if only for a moment - before joining their democratic colleagues in rising to their feet to applaud clinton when he called for preserving two of the most important guarantees we make to every american - social security and medicare
gop criticism of clinton's 89-minute performance was cautious reflecting a desire not to get on the wrong side of an important issue in an election year
while i am in agreement with many of his goals generally it is important that we restrict increases in spending said sen william roth r-del chairman of the senate finance committee
clinton's array of proposals - some new some old many repackaged - included an expanded $350 billion tax cut a revised health-care plan and big spending increases for schools clinton also proposed a new handgun-licensing plan urging states to issue photo ids for purchasers and require gun-safety courses
he called for tax incentives for clean fuels an increase in the head start program and for paying off much of the $36 trillion national debt in 13 years he renewed a call for an overhaul of campaign finance laws a patient's bill of rights and an increase in the minimum wage
by the count of house budget committee chairman john kasich r-ohio clinton's program entails 132 new or increased government spending initiatives and tax preferences senate budget chairman pete domenici r-nm suggested clinton will be spending money faster than the government can print it
fortunately for clinton the state of the world - both his private one and the world at large - is far more serene than a year ago
not only did he deliver last year's state of the union address while facing a senate impeachment trial but the united states had just concluded an air war against iraq and was close to beginning one against yugoslavia and the asian financial crisis - now just a fading memory - was still roiling wall street
while republicans fumed about pricetags democrats were happy to embrace clinton's farewell agenda house democratic leader dick gephardt of missouri called it a starting point for our debate in congress this year about our nation's future
gephardt would become speaker if democrats reclaim the house in november
but gore seated beside house speaker dennis hastert - and looming behind clinton - was clearly the primary intended beneficiary of clinton's litany
clinton mentioned his vice president a half dozen times and even borrowed items from his platform - including the call for photo-ids for gun owners gore adviser bob shrum helped write the address
thus republicans registered open delight over a rare clinton slip of the tongue - when he praised gore for helping to make communities more liberal whoops make that more livable clinton corrected
if clinton was not above openly praising gore neither were republicans reluctant to get in their own plugs
i look forward to working with the president to achieve a commonsense agenda based on the sound principles of fiscal responsibility and compassionate conservatism hastert said
it was a not-very-subtle bow to gop front-runner george w bush's signature compassionate conservatism mantra
few could lose sight of the fact that it is after all an election year
editor's note - tom raum covers national and international affairs for the associated press
using new powers granted by congress the federal government found $1 billion in the accounts of parents who owe overdue child support payments states are seizing the accounts and getting parents to pay up
washington state officials have seized hundreds of accounts and collected $2 million from deadbeat parents florida has seized 232 accounts and collected $191706
in ohio one county child support office froze the accounts of 40 people who owed $90000 so far more than $40000 owed to children has been collected and paid back an additional 17 people have been notified their accounts could be seized
it's a very important tool for us said maricarol torsok director of a county child support office near toledo ohio
torsok received the names of parents with bank accounts from the department of health and human services which has been working with 2300 banks across the country since august to find the accounts of 3 million parents who owe child support
the department sends a computer tape with the names and social security numbers of delinquent parents to large multistate banks and brokerages which in turn search their records to find a match
so far 662000 accounts were matched with names states get the information within 48 hours of the match and move quickly to freeze the account and collect what's owed
the bank account match system is part of a tough law passed by congress in 1996 to track down parents who owe child support payments and tap their wages tax refunds and bank accounts
the law was revised in 1998 to give hhs the authority to do matches with large banks with branches in many states states have until october to work out agreements with local banks to conduct their own matches
we are working harder than ever to ensure children get the support from both parents they deserve and need hhs secretary donna shalala said
some 30 million children are owed $50 billion in child support and funds are being collected in only 23 percent of all cases according to the association for children for enforcement of support inc an advocacy group
one-third of all child support cases involve parents who live in a different state than the one that has ordered them to pay
state officials say the bank account matching system works best when the parent has an account at banks within the state
torsok said her office received over 5000 hits from hhs many involving parents whose accounts were at out-of-state banks seizing those accounts involves many steps so the state focused first on accounts at banks in ohio
account holders are sent a notice saying that the state can take a variety of steps to seize their assets including freezing bank accounts they can request a hearing but few do most deadbeats do not find out that their accounts have been seized until they try to access their account
the notice doesn't say in big bold letter that we're going to take your money so if they choose to ignore the letter they find out when they go to withdraw money torsok said
notification rules vary from state to state
in washington state parents already under notice that they owe money do not receive any warning that their bank accounts are in jeopardy
if the contents of the account holds less than what the parents owe the state can take everything
this is a last resort collection tool it's someone who owes arrears and is not cooperating said charles donnelly policy manager at the state's division of child support
many states have had serious problems delivering to families the fruits of collection efforts because of problems with new computer systems created to allow states to share information and track down deadbeats more easily
debbie kline project director at the association for enforcement of support applauded the bank match system but questioned how quickly money collected will get to the kids that need it
this whole thing would work a lot better if the state systems worked said kline
president clinton could be suspended or banned from practicing law in his home state depending on the results of an investigation ordered by the arkansas supreme court
the court on thursday ordered its professional conduct committee to investigate complaints that president clinton lied and obstructed justice in the paula jones sexual harassment case
we're not commenting on it white house spokesman jim kennedy said
lawyer l lynn hogue filed a complaint on behalf of the southeastern legal foundation of atlanta on sept 15 1998 days after clinton testified before then-independent counsel kenneth starr's grand jury
the court order was issued after hogue said he thought his complaint had been ignored for more than a year
a second complaint was filed by us district judge susan webber wright last april after she found clinton in contempt of court during the jones case wright said clinton testified falsely when asked about his relationship with former white house intern monica lewinsky
this is a victory not only for slf but also for the nation's legal community and the millions of americans who still believe that lawyers who lie under oath have forfeited their right to practice law foundation president matt glavin said
james neal director for the court's professional conduct committee did not return calls seeking comment in the court proceedings the committee argued that confidentiality prevented release of information about the case
according to committee guidelines if the committee finds sufficient evidence to support a complaint a docket number will be assigned and clinton notified
after clinton and the accusers respond the committee will consider the evidence and possible punishments the most serious would be to refer the case to circuit court for disbarment proceedings
sixteen years after his last campaign ronald reagan's presidential committee remains in operation with a half-million dollars in leftover donations and a treasurer paid several thousand dollars a year the treasurer longtime reagan loyalist bay buchanan has received more than $45000 from the fund this decade
buchanan is the sister of reform party presidential candidate and former reagan white house speechwriter pat buchanan
the reagans did not know about the leftover funds which as of september totaled $494230 until the account was brought to their attention by the associated press this month an aide to the former president said
naturally it would be wonderful to see that kind of contribution made to the reagan library reagan's chief of staff joanne drake said
one of the campaign committee's trustees former attorney general edwin meese iii said such a donation would have to wait until the campaign committee could redeem the long-term notes that it has invested its money in
at some point it will go to the reagan library meese said
for most of the 1990s the reagan-bush '84 committee has simply earned interest and dividend payments paid taxes and doled out a consulting fee to bay buchanan
federal election commission records show she has collected $45715 in consulting fees and expenses from the reagan fund this decade ranging from $869 in 1992 to as much as $7500 in 1997 she has filed quarterly reports with the fec and paid the necessary taxes on the fund's earnings
bay buchanan did not immediately return phone calls to her office seeking comment
campaign finance experts expressed surprise that the fund has been left open this many years
that's amazing election lawyer kenneth gross said in the modern era i can't think of a committee that would continue to exist and pay salary to somebody that is unprecedented
the average presidential campaign committee shuts down within five years of the election according to republican consultant stan huckaby who was treasurer of george bush's 1988 and 1992 campaign committees both have been closed as has president clinton's 1992 committee
gross said the only reason to keep a campaign committee around for more than a decade is to enable the candidate to raise money to pay off debts john glenn's 1984 presidential campaign - still $26 million in debt - continues to exist for that reason
but reagan's 1984 committee has no debts
between jan 1 1997 and sept 30 1999 the committee took in $42180 - all from dividends and interest it paid out $31942 with $17766 or 56 percent going to bay buchanan most of the rest went for taxes
meese said the campaign committee trustees decided to put the money in long-term investments until they could decide where the leftover funds should go
the money was invested pending a decision on what to do with it meese said
federal law would allow the money to be given to other federal candidates or political action committees to be refunded to contributors or to be donated to a charity or educational institution such as reagan's presidential library
for instance reagan's 1980 presidential committee donated its leftover money to republican candidates and the former president's leadership pac citizens for the republic
there could be tax consequences down the road if the committee does not eventually give away the money gross said the internal revenue service can declare the money personal income and require reagan to pay income taxes on it
the former president who lives in los angeles is in declining health due to alzheimer's disease he disclosed in 1994 that he had the incurable brain disorder
the grandmothers of elian gonzalez may have been frustrated in their attempt at bringing the 6-year-old home to cuba any time soon but they're apparently gaining ground in their effort to persuade congress to reject legislation granting the boy citizenship
having won at least a delay in congressional action on the proposed legislation the grandmothers were to return saturday to cuba without the child after more planned congressional visits today
they were also seeking a meeting with president clinton but white house aides suggested that seemed unlikely - despite clinton's support for their cause
raquel rodriquez the maternal grandmother and mariela quintana the paternal grandmother predicted they would eventually prevail - even if not on this trip
we will keep fighting said rodriquez we're going to bring him back right now we can't do it
elian has been the center of controversy since he was found clinging to an inner tube nov 25 off the florida coast his mother and others traveling with him in an effort to flee cuba had drowned
the immigration and naturalization service has ruled that the youngster should be returned to his father in cuba but relatives of the boy in this country are fighting to keep him here
congressional support for the citizenship bill seemed to be dwindling however
on some issues politicians just have to step aside said house speaker dennis hastert
after a meeting of gop house members hastert r-ill would only say there's a difference of opinion among republicans about how to proceed hastert has supported the legislation but declined to predict its fate
hastert said that the bill would not be rushed to the floor as its sponsors had hoped
instead he said it would be referred to the house judiciary committee's immigration subcommittee
samuel stratman a spokesman for judiciary committee chairman henry hyde r-ill said it was doubtful the panel would act until it received a report from the justice department on the boy's immigration case
that almost certainly guarantees there won't be action anytime soon the bill's opponents said
in the senate there was strong democratic opposition to the bill and republicans were divided sen chuck hagel r-neb a member of the foreign relations committee waged a strong battle to keep the measure off the senate floor
senate majority leader trent lott r-miss backed off his attempt to bring the bill up this week
now said spokesman john czwartacki it may - or may not - come up next week
late thursday rep charles rangel d-ny a leading congressional proponent of returning elian to cuba claimed the rounds made by the grandmothers both on thursday and earlier in the week had helped to build congressional opposition to the citizenship bill
he called the entire matter a tragic human experience and a tragic political experience
the grandmothers who met in miami beach on wednesday with their grandson claimed that he appeared withdrawn and fearful during the session
our grandson is a whole different boy he has changed completely we have to save this boy as soon as possible said quintana
according to court papers filed in miami the boy's father claims that relatives in florida offered to give him money a home and a car if he would join elian in the united states
meanwhile a delegation that included two of the boy's florida cousins also made the rounds on capitol hill urging support for the citizenship bill
he doesn't want to go back said marisleysis gonzalez a cousin of elian i saw him approach his grandmothers and had the opportunity to see his face and it was still the face of fear
the grandmothers disagreed we told him we wanted to bring him back to cuba he nodded his head yes quintana said
in miami us district judge william m hoeveler on thursday gave attorneys for the great-uncle of elian - who has temporary custody of him - the extra time they asked for to fight the us government's efforts to return the boy to his father in cuba
hoeveler gave the florida relatives until feb 24 to respond to the government's motion to dismiss their challenge and gave the government until march 2 to file their response the judge said he would begin hearing arguments on the motion to dismiss the week of march 6
director s lee taylor admits that social intercourse his independent film about a cybergeek looking for love has limited appeal
but there it is on video shelves alongside hollywood's top hits taylor couldn't be more thrilled
the film is one of the first 10 movies in hollywood video's first rites program an effort launched this month to showcase independent films that generally have only been seen on the festival circuit
hollywood video picks up the movies as exclusive rentals available only at its stores blockbuster the nation's largest video chain has been doing the same for the past year
in an indie world where only a fraction of films ever get seen outside festivals - and even those that make it to theaters rarely pack in big crowds - such direct-to-video deals offer filmmakers a new shot at reaching a wide audience
i'm assuming i won't garner a following from this i don't think anyone's going to be looking for the next steve taylor film taylor said but when you have someone really championing your film like this it makes a difference
blockbuster which bills itself as the biggest independent film distributor picked up seven films that played at last year's sundance film festival and expects to cut deals for 10 to 12 from this year's festival which ends sunday
hollywood video also expects to go home with new films from sundance and is sponsoring a contest during the festival asking filmmakers to drop off copies of their movies at least one of those films will be added to the retailer's independent movie catalog
both video chains have been trolling other film festivals looking for movies and they receive a steady stream of movie submissions by mail the companies say adding exclusive independent titles gives consumers a wider selection and exposure to quality films that otherwise might never have been seen
we want to make sure our customers are satisfied and keep coming back said dean wilson blockbuster executive vice president for merchandising
blockbuster offered 70 exclusive titles last year and plans on 120 more this year the deals range from outright purchase of movies to short-term contracts where filmmakers receive a percentage of rental fees in lieu of money upfront
hollywood video cuts six-month exclusive deals for its movies offering filmmakers a share of rental fees after the initial 10 titles the company plans to add six new movies each month
more customers are looking for independent films said jonae kurtenbach-woodruff hollywood video rental marketing director they don't just want to see big studio films people are interested in movies they can't see anywhere else
while independent filmmakers dream of wide theatrical releases landing their movies in video stores can bring them exposure and cash that helps get their next films going
this sounds really magnanimous but if i weren't to see a penny it wouldn't bother me taylor said my movie's gotten exposure and that's worth it all right there
becoming an independent businessman 10 years ago turned jerry moylan into an independent voter
once i became a businessperson i decided i couldn't align myself to a party said moylan a 36-year-old clothing and gift shop owner from tilton i have to look for the best person to do the job
but moylan like many voters unaffiliated with either of the two major parties had yet to find that best person just days before the new hampshire primary he was leaning toward vice president al gore a democrat but also was considering arizona sen john mccain a republican
between the democrats frankly the experience of gore is going to sway me more than bill bradley's proposals moylan said bradley seems a little far reaching i think i have more faith in the incremental steps gore is proposing on health care
moylan thinks mccain's military background would make him the most qualified on foreign policy but that's not the only reason he may vote for him
i'd just really like to not see george w bush get in he said
call it the new hampshire declaration of independents for a key group of new hampshire voters this week the pursuit of the perfect candidate - regardless of party - ranks right up there with life liberty and happiness
just under 275000 of the state's approximately 738000 registered voters are unaffiliated with either party they outnumber republicans or democrats for the first time and can vote in either primary tuesday making them a potentially powerful force
glenn martin of amherst also was still deciding whether to vote republican or democratic but his top choices were mccain and bradley
mccain's good with the military - he understands that said martin a business manager for a defense contractor
he just comes across as being a pretty square shooter he said likewise bradley also comes across as less political more for the people
but while polls continue to show mccain with strong support among independents a survey released thursday showed that bradley's lead among democratic-leaning independents has eroded or disappeared self-identified independents favored gore over bradley 50 percent to 40 percent in the franklin pierce college-wnds-tv poll the exact opposite of the same poll a few days earlier
robin marra director of franklin pierce's polling institute said 18 percent of independents have not committed to voting in either the republican or democratic primaries while the rest are split with 44 percent planning to vote republican and 36 percent voting democratic
i think some of the democrat-leaning independents are probably disappointed with bradley's performance in iowa and his seeming inability to catch fire here so they're probably reverting to their traditional party loyalties marra said
secretary of state bill gardner said thursday he expected only 81000 independents to vote which would be 23 percent of the 351000 votes he predicts will be cast
pollsters estimate that between 10 percent and 25 percent of independents actually switch parties from election to election the rest consistently support republicans or democrats
robert cousins another independent is sure he'll vote republican but continued to ponder his choices thursday while juggling cash and customers at his concord deli in contrast to the hectic pace at work he is taking his time deciding
steve forbes had been his favorite but wednesday night's debate made me look at alan keyes a little more he said
i think he'd be really good talking to foreign leaders he said forbes and keyes both seem like they would use us law instead of trying to change it or make new laws on the fly for their own personal agendas when dealing with foreign countries
asked when he planned to make up his mind cousins smiled
by tuesday he said
myanmar government forces have seized the base of the fringe rebel group god's army sending the rebels' leaders twin 12-year-old boys fleeing into the jungle
god's army's 100 guerrillas had split up into three separate bands headed by the boys johnny and luther htoo and a veteran adult guerrilla su bia a thai military intelligence officer said
they were apparently headed for karjom mountain near their fallen camp at ka mar pa law on the myanmar side of the thailand-myanmar border the officer said he asked not to be named
a local dissident radio station with good rebel contacts also reported the fall of god's army headquarters
god's army was one of the rebel groups involved in the siege of a thai hospital earlier this week on tuesday 10 gunmen from god's army and an allied group the vigorous burmese student warriors were killed by thai commandos who stormed the hospital and freed hundreds of people
thais were outraged by the seizure of the ratchaburi provincial hospital 60 miles west of bangkok fears have risen of a backlash against 100000 mostly karen ethnic minority refugees living in camps along the border
the karen national union the biggest rebel army still fighting myanmar's military regime has disavowed god's army but the group has operated on the edges of knu territory and received material support from it
saw ba thin the new knu leader said that the group considers ka mar pa law its territory he said knu guerrillas were fighting myanmar forces nearby
it's difficult to say if they will survive saw ba thin said of god's army it depends if they stand or regroup
like many karen god's army's soldiers are fundamentalist christians in a predominantly buddhist country the group was formed in 1997 when knu fighters abandoned the village where johnny and luther htoo lived leaving it unprotected against a myanmar offensive
according to legend the twins rallied some men and waged a successful counterattack their followers now believe they have magical powers that guarantee them victory and protect them from harm
the boys' word is obeyed without question they constantly smoke cigarettes and cheroot cigars but forbid drinking gambling and swearing
god's army was an insignificant group until october when it gave refuge to another fringe group - the vigorous burmese student warriors who had just seized myanmar's embassy in bangkok and then escaped
the myanmar army went into action once the rainy season ended
ka mar pa law came under sustained attack last week sending 1000 karen civilians over the border into thailand thailand then shelled rebel positions to keep the fighters from joining them
in reaction the 10 gunmen seized the hospital and demanded that thailand stop the shelling and give refuge to fighters and civilians
journalists from the democratic voice of burma a dissident radio station said their sources reported ka mar pa law fell thursday morning a spokesman for myanmar's government would not confirm the base had fallen but said skirmishes had gone on for days
the thai defense ministry said soldiers were reinforcing the border to keep armed intruders out the rebels were welcome to enter thailand but only if they laid down their arms officials said
a plan to move nuclear waste on ohio highways or rails is generating concern among elected officials and public interest organizations
the us department of energy is considering storing used nuclear waste from the nation's power plants at an underground dump about 100 miles from las vegas at yucca mountain
i urge the department of energy to do everything in its power to ensure that clevelanders receive accurate and complete information mayor michael r white said thursday at an outdoor news conference adjacent to a highway and rail corridor
the mayor appeared with a critic of the plan chris trepal executive director of the earth day coalition
the environmental group and others planned to ask the agency about potential risks and emergency planning at a hearing today in cleveland
trepal said her group wants the government to cease the historic plan to transport the most dangerous and radioactive waste through the heart of our community and the back yards of over 50 million people nationwide
the government's latest round of public hearings began monday in lincoln neb and will continue tuesday in chicago
like cleveland lincoln and chicago are along the main rail and highway routes heading from the east coast to nevada
gayle fisher spokeswoman for the energy department's yucca mountain project office said today's hearing will be the 19th of 20 scheduled during a six-month comment period ten hearings have been held in nevada
we're still studying the site and the routes she said even if everything were approved we would not be starting until 2010
she said as many as nine shipments a week could go through ohio involving mostly trucks if trains are primarily used there could be two train shipments each week and one truck shipment every five or six days
the department of energy has a very good track record for shipping nuclear materials fisher said there are very strict guidelines that must be followed
upending his campaign's core theme bill bradley has launched a frenetic assault on rival al gore's honesty and is arguing that the vice president cannot be trusted to tell the truth
some polls have suggested that gore is gaining days before the new hampshire primary and bradley abandoned his high-road tactic to directly confront his rival
gore and his aides said the move smacked of desperation while bradley said enough is enough and he would no longer tolerate distortions by gore
i won't be reinventing myself said bradley however i can tell you right now i am no longer going to accept misrepresentations of my positions by al gore
bradley said he has gotten a positive response to his more confrontational style unveiled in a debate wednesday in the attack the former new jersey senator all but called gore a liar though he didn't use that word
sometimes in politics people make misleading statements because they don't know any better said bradley i think he knows better but he continues to say what is untrue
that says volumes about what gore would do if elected bradley argued
how you run a campaign is how you govern that was the point i was making and i waited a long time to make it bradley said
gore addressing employees of a high-tech firm in manchester on thursday said anew that bradley was turning the campaign negative
i don't understand how someone can condemn negative attacks while in the same breath can make negative attacks said gore who cut his campaign day short to return to washington to attend president clinton's final state of the union address
one of bradley's contentions in the debate was that gore had been inconsistent on abortion rights including voting as a member of congress to restrict access to the procedure and the suggestion haunted gore on thursday
the vice president was a guest on a new hampshire public radio call-in show when a woman accused him of lying about his abortion record in the debate i don't know how i can support your candidacy if you're so dishonest on national tv she said
in response gore said i have always supported roe vs wade i have always supported keeping abortion legal and it's true early in my career i voted to restrict the use of federal funding in some circumstances but over the years i've come to the view that federal funding ought to be available
in addition to the tougher rhetoric bradley stepped up his schedule thursday - starting early on a frigid morning and stumping deep into the evening - and a new air of urgency surrounded his campaign entourage
along the way he engaged in chaotic handshaking at grocery and convenience stores even helping to bag groceries he also mingled with patrons at a portsmouth pub where politics wasn't on the forefront of everyone's mind
bradley's shift in approach had been under discussion since he was hammered in the leadoff iowa caucuses monday night supporters such as nebraska sen bob kerrey have been battering gore in public arguing that he's been distorting bradley's record and they have been pushing bradley in private to become more aggressive
the change risks bradley's core appeal as the nontraditional politician who is above attack politics
gore aides dismissed the new approach as the last gasp of a troubled campaign
he's clearly listening to his consultants said gore spokesman chris lehane his music wasn't playing this undermines the central presence of his campaign
numerous polls have shown gore with at least a slight lead in new hampshire
hoping to avoid the charge that he's turning the campaign negative bradley also is running a new batch of positive television commercials in the state
bradley said gore consistently misrepresents his health plan by arguing it would replace medicaid with $150-a-month vouchers bradley said he's told gore repeatedly that's not the case bradley said gore also argues - wrongly - that the health plan would fritter away the projected budget surplus
al gore turned a deficit in new hampshire polls into a lead during his aggressive campaign for the iowa caucuses but bill bradley is showing his feisty side in an effort to reverse that trend before the nation's first presidential primary
new hampshire tracking polls in recent days have suggested that vice president gore has a lead of anywhere from 7 points to 17 points depending on the poll
but the pollster for one of those surveys dick bennett of the american research group saw some tantalizing signs thursday night that bradley's newly aggressive approach may help reverse his slide as tuesday's primary nears
bennett noted that bradley picked up ground among undecided voters thursday night but stilled trailed gore 50 percent to 40 percent in the three-day poll he cautioned that it was too early to tell whether bradley's progress in the polls was significant
tomorrow night will show if this trend holds bennett said on his poll release tracking polls are rolling averages of several one-night polls and can be deceptive - sometimes showing quick evidence of change and sometimes showing variations that have more to do with the relatively small sample of people who are polled each night
but numerous tracking polls over a period of days can offer significant evidence of a candidate's movement over time and they all picked up gore's surge past bradley a former new jersey senator in the last few weeks
bradley had been relying on his strength with independents when he led many polls during the fall independents will play a key role in the new hampshire primary about one out of five say they haven't decided whether to vote in the democratic or republican primary said robin marra director of the polling institute at franklin pierce college
on the republican side sen john mccain and gov george w bush are in a very close race with mccain leading in several of the tracking polls by anywhere from a narrow edge to 12 points
the american research group poll released thursday had mccain at 36 percent and bush at 32 percent a slight improvement for bush in that poll and a difference within the poll's 4-point error margin
the top candidates' increasingly aggressive campaigning could play well with new hampshire voters a poll by fox-wmur-university of new hampshire said that many likely voters more than a third on the democratic and the republican sides choose one quality over the others when it comes to determining who they will support he stands up for what he believes
three days a week the associated press asks the presidential candidates a question on the issues today's question and the responses
labor standards
would you favor a system that would ban products made by child labor or under unsafe or unhealthy conditions from being sold in the united states
democrats
bill bradley i have called for the wto world trade organization to prohibit all trade in goods produced with forced child labor
al gore the united states currently supports initiatives that ban the importation of products produced by forced or indentured child labor i support these and other initiatives aimed at protecting children from exploitation just recently at the wto ministerial meeting in seattle the president signed the instrument of ratification of the international labor organization's convention on the elimination of the worst forms of child labor this document declared on behalf of the american people that we will not tolerate child slavery the sale or trafficking of children child prostitution or pornography forced or compulsory child labor and hazardous work that harms the health safety and morals of children through these and other initiatives we are reaffirming both at home and across the globe our fundamental belief in human dignity and our unchanging reverence for human rights
reform
pat buchanan the us should impose tariffs on countries that use child labor to deny these regimes any benefit from the exploitation of children and keep those tariffs on until the regimes take children out of their sweatshops
republicans
gary bauer yes the united states must not divorce its values from trade policy
george w bush no response
steve forbes it is immoral to force children to work particularly in unsafe and unhealthy conditions and we should oppose it one of the important issues i have raised in this campaign is stopping slave labor products from adults or children from being sold in the us communist china has a particularly loathsome record in this area as president i will work to stop this and will impose sanctions on companies that engage in such practices
alan keyes no response
john mccain i have supported legislation banning the importation of goods into the united states manufactured by child or slave labor defining unsafe or unhealthy labor conditions however lends itself far too much to subjective analysis by interested parties in both business and labor therefore i would ensure that cases are reviewed individually to ensure that health and safety standards were appropriate based on relevant standards
congressional republicans say president clinton's valedictory state of the union address offered some hope they can find common ground with him on debt reduction education and other issues
i think a lot of it is doable if the president will sit down and work with us said house speaker dennis hastert r-ill singling out health care education debt reduction tax cuts and anti-drug aid to colombia as areas of potential agreement
but following clinton's 89-minute speech to congress on thursday night the longest of his eight state of the union addresses many of the same old divisions remained republicans said he had proposed far too much new spending and not enough tax reduction which combined with their lingering distrust of him lays the groundwork for a contentious election year
the proof is not him saying it tonight to a national television audience said rep joe barton r-texas the proof is directing his minions to work with the republican congress to actually do it
the president used his address to senators and representatives gathered in the house chamber in part to recount the successes of his first seven years in office a near-record economic expansion federal deficits morphed into surpluses lower crime rates
in 1992 we just had a roadmap today we have results he said
he also laid out a wish list for his final year that ranged from sweeping ideas - $350 billion in tax cuts retirement savings accounts more spending for schools and health care photo id licenses for handguns - to narrower ones like encouraging the development of new vaccines and less-polluting cars
tonight is special because we stand on the mountaintop of a new millennium clinton said behind us we see the great expanse of american achievement before us even grander frontiers of possibility
some of his proposals have the potential for bipartisan compromise
he would spend more for teachers head start after-school and summer school programs and provide college tuition tax deductions of up to $2800 per family he wants to use parts of the huge projected federal surpluses to eliminate the $36 trillion publicly held portion of the national debt by 2013
the president's tax package joined a mix of proposals urged by republicans and democrats as both sides battle for control of congress and the white house house republicans are drafting their own version of educational tax breaks and relief from the so-called marriage penalty this year presidential candidates have their own proposals too
clinton would boost funds for scientific research raise military pay increase the $515 hourly minimum wage and create a new medicare prescription drug benefit and he would pare taxes for child care long-term care of ailing relatives charitable giving and companies investing in inner cities and rural areas
for too long this congress has been standing still on some of our most pressing national priorities he said in one of his few overt swipes at the republicans from whom democrats hope to win congressional control in november let's begin with them
but leavening such attacks were other gestures such as when he turned and shook hands with hastert after lauding him for supporting efforts to increase investments in urban areas and many republicans eager to at least appear cooperative in an election year returned the favor
he wants to have a legacy said rep thomas davis r-va chairman of the national republican congressional committee the house gop's campaign arm he has some reasonable proposals here and we want to deal with them it works for us if he does it right we like to show we're doing things too
even house majority whip tom delay r-texas one of clinton's most bitter foes joined many of the frequent rounds of applause and left the door open to accomplishment
everyone knows we have some very serious disagreements over some very important principles delay said but i am hopeful that the president will work with us and leave office with a record of achievement
with the new hampshire presidential primary just five days away clinton boosted his personal favorite vice president al gore by mentioning him six times he also recognized another candidate seated in the galleries above the house chamber first lady hillary rodham clinton running for the us senate seat in new york
but from the presidential campaign trail gop contender george w bush couldn't resist firing away at clinton's proposals
the litany of spending programs the president announced tonight proves my point that if you leave a large surplus in washington the money will be spent on bigger government the texas governor said
the politics was also evident in some of the proposals clinton made that have little or no chance of enactment this year those included his calls for campaign finance reform and licensing handgun owners
the american people will throw that right back into his face said sen larry craig r-idaho a member of the national rifle association
clinton renewed his push for new rights for patients of health maintenance organizations he would provide health insurance for millions of low-income parents - a $110 billion 10-year effort - and let people between 55 and 65 buy into the medicare medical insurance program to help them afford that he would provide them with a tax credit
american airlines recently adopted a policy allowing pilots who are too tired to fly to beg off a flight without penalty a top executive said thursday at a hearing into a crash that killed 11 people last year
the two pilots of the plane that crashed june 1 while trying to land in a storm in little rock had been on duty for more than 13 hours - just shy of american's maximum 14-hour day pilot richard buschmann was killed and co-pilot michael origel was injured
national transportation safety board investigator greg feith said the long day was not unusual for american pilots
we have received numerous people calling us or providing us letters that people are flying tired - that american airlines pilots are still on the edge of fatigue and management isn't listening feith said
robert baker vice chairman for american's parent company amr corp said we have said to our pilots in no uncertain terms if you feel you are unable to perform because of fatigue then you are off the trip at your request with no recourse from the company'
baker who was in charge of american's operations at the time of the crash was promoted three weeks ago to a new position created to oversee safety and security
he said the airline plans to revise its policies on approaches and landings and avoiding thunderstorms pilots will also be given more training on interpreting radar
the air transport association in washington said thursday it did not know of fatigue-related policies for individual airlines but did say that pilots in general have been able to beg off flights in case of illness
eleven people were killed and 110 injured when flight 1420 landed in high wind and heavy rain ran off the runway broke apart and caught fire
since then american has evaluated itself three times and come up with 85 recommendations for improvements baker said
we have learned some things we've got some work to do we will be a better airline for it he said
new york officials looking to the federal government for relief from soaring fuel prices say emergency grants the clinton administration announced this week are inadequate
new york has 14 million poor residents eligible for federal low income fuel assistance more than any other state and gov george pataki had sought between $35 and $40 million in the emergency aid yet new york received $26 million well below the amount awarded to other less-populated states
maine for instance received $103 million in aid with 83478 eligible low-income households
we are dumbfounded by this decision pataki spokesman michael mckeon said thursday it's hard to understand how the administration can say that this would be any significant help
heating oil prices have nearly doubled in some parts of the northeast recently
a typical new york state family's home heating oil bill was about $360 last january this month it is headed to $680 the price for home heating oil in new york state rose from an average of 90 cents a gallon to as much as $170 a gallon - mostly in the last two cold weeks according to government and business surveys
a variety of factors have been blamed for the increase ranging from a brutal european winter that has sapped us supplies to a frozen hudson river that has added time to oil tankers trips
michael kharfen a spokesman for the department of health and human services said the amounts of the emergency grants had been based on a formula taking into account the coldness of the state's temperature and the costliness of the heating costs he said while those factors were bad in new york they were not as bad as they were in other states
of the 11 states receiving the $44 million in total federal aid maine massachusetts new hampshire connecticut and new jersey each received more money than new york all had far fewer eligible households rhode island pennsylvania alaska vermont and delaware received less money than new york
kharfen also explained that new york already receives a hefty annual allocation of low income heating assistance program money known as liheap in the 2000 fiscal year new york received $1363 million he said
that's the largest of any state in the nation kharfen said
that failed to placate new york lawmakers who said they were being shortchanged
this administration has bungled the government's response to skyrocketing fuel oil prices rep john mchugh r-watertown said
mchugh and some other lawmakers including new york's democratic sen charles schumer are calling on the administration to dip into the nation's strategic oil reserves to help offset the skyrocketing fuel prices
us energy secretary bill richardson opposes that but said thursday he was delaying the delivery of 5 million barrels of oil to the 580 million barrel reserve in an attempt to stem oil price increases somewhat
richardson said he is perplexed by the sudden steep rise in oil prices and said the energy department has begun more closely monitoring the heating oil market
the united states consumes about 18 million barrels of oil a day according to the american petroleum institute
for sale by owner beautiful country home three bedroom two bath and high ceilings set amid 25 acres of secluded lakes and hills in the ozarks broken dreams not included
for nearly a year arlyne and darrell barnes tried to give their dream retirement home away in a contest anyone interested was to send $100 and an essay on why they wanted the home
the couple hoped to raise enough money to pay off their mortgage and set some money aside to pay for a private investigation into their son's unsolved death
but too few people entered the contest now with bills from lawyers and private investigators piling up the couple has dropped the contest and put the house up for sale
it's really a shame mrs barnes said thursday but the fact that we made so many new friends and received so many prayers made it all worth the effort
the house is being listed as $159900 well below its appraised price of $200000 we have so many bills and loans we are going to lose it if we don't sell it mrs barnes said
only 613 people entered the contest their money has been refunded
the couple had hoped to raise at least $50000 to pay for a private investigation into the death of mitchell krupp mrs barnes' 29-year-old son from a previous marriage
krupp's home near brentwood ark burned in july 1997 in a blaze authorities say was deliberately set investigators found krupp's remains between the springs of his bed mattress along with the remains of a shotgun a lead shot was found in his skull
investigators said the fire destroyed so much evidence they may never learn how he died the case remains open
mrs barnes says she believes her son was murdered and his death made to look like a suicide she has filed a wrongful death lawsuit against krupp's wife of six years pam worrell both mrs barnes and her lawyer charles kester declined comment on the pending lawsuit
having exhausted their life savings on investigators and lawyers the couple needed money the contest idea was inspired by the spitfire grill a 1996 movie in which an elderly woman makes her restaurant the prize in a similar giveaway
they had built the home nine years ago as a place to retire with a view of a private trout-stocked lake a separate workshop an indoor pool cathedral ceilings and a wraparound porch it seemed a sure bet that people would bid $100 for a chance
they announced the contest last february with a deadline of june 15 with entries lagging they extended the deadline to september 15
now having fallen short of their goal of 1800 entries mrs barnes said she doesn't know what's next for her and her husband
it's been 2 1/2 years since my son died she said we never planned on any of this
a nonprofit group called voices of victims has shown interest in turning the property into its national headquarters and a retreat for grieving families of murderer children but the organization doesn't have a lot of money and mrs barnes says she can't wait for members to raise it
wanting to create something positive from the contest mrs barnes said she may compile the essays she received into a book
she said several people wrote of loved ones who also had died under mysterious and unsolved circumstances
it really opened our eyes to the number of unsolved murders there are out there she said we were truly inspired to continue seeking the truth in my son's case
lawmakers are eyeing reforms for the internal revenue service's system of penalties and interest but a top treasury official says too many changes would confuse taxpayers
penalties and interest can be quite severe even debilitating rep amo houghton r-ny and chairman of the tax-writing house ways and means oversight subcommittee said thursday
we as representatives of the people must take pains to ensure that innocent taxpayers' lives are not ruined by a cascading imposition of penalties and interest due to honest mistakes houghton said at a hearing
but joseph mikrut tax legislative counsel for the treasury department told houghton's subcommittee that while some changes may be needed they should not be drastic
there is no perfect system of sanctions and striking the appropriate balance inherently involves tradeoffs among competing concerns mikrut said warning that changes could send mixed signals to taxpayers
the comments come as congress looks at ways to reform the penalty and interest system
in 1998 congress passed a series of bills to make the irs less heavy-handed and lawmakers have cited penalty and interest reform as an example that further change is needed in the agency
the treasury department is concerned that big changes in the law will confuse americans and cause more delinquent taxpayers mikrut said
although a penalty regime should not be overly harsh to noncompliant taxpayers the currently high compliance level should not be discouraged he said
houghton cited as an example a constituent who was notified two years ago that deductions claimed between 1981-1986 had been disallowed the interest clock was running all this time he said
other lawmakers had similar stories rep jerry weller r-ill said a physician in his district was notified that he owed the irs a penny and had been fined $100
some of the changes mikrut said treasury supports include eliminating the failure to file penalty and imposing a higher failure to pay penalty and elimination of interest in situations where the irs may be at fault or there are circumstances out of the taxpayer's control that cause payment delays
further changes may cause a blurring of the penalty and interest systems mikrut cautioned
america's cup sailors use sophisticated technology to gauge the speed and pressure of the wind - anemometers barometers and birds
on friday there wasn't enough wind to hold the third race of the challenger finals on saturday northerly breezes of 10 to 20 knots should allow americaone and prada of italy to continue their best-of-9 series tied at 1-1
the yachts are allowed to receive data from their weather boats until 10 minutes before the race after that they're on their own instruments on the mast feed data into a laptop computer on board
sometimes though crew members use other sources
they'll watch the way birds are flying bob mcdavitt of the metropolitan weather service of auckland said friday they'll see what helicopters are doing in the sky because quite often the choppers need to face the wind to steady themselves so that tells you what the weather is like that high in the air
mcdavitt is an america's cup veteran he was the weatherman for the new zealand teams that competed in fremantle australia in 1987 and san diego in 1992
wind conditions in both those areas are less shifty than those in the hauraki gulf off auckland which is surrounded by land on three sides only winds from the north and northeast travel almost entirely over water
under america's cup rules no race can start unless the wind is stronger than five knots for 10 consecutive minutes without major shifts in direction if that doesn't happen between 115 pm local time when the races are scheduled to start and 3 pm they're postponed
on friday the race was postponed at 240 pm because winds rarely surpassed five knots so while their boats bobbed around in the placid waters crew members relaxed
americaone skipper paul cayard lay down on the deck his hands behind his head other sailors chatted and laughed waiting for the race committee's decision
the sailors tend to be in modes of thought mcdavitt said you're either in race mode or relax mode you can flip from one to another pretty quickly
auckland was under a high pressure system which tends to keep winds down sunny days though can speed them up
it was too cloudy today for the sun to heat the land and the land to suck in the breeze mcdavitt said not enough sunshine sorry about that
more apologies may be in order sunday when the fourth race is scheduled the forecast was for rain and blustery winds in the morning and a wind shift from north to west which you don't like to have in the middle of the race since the course may have to be changed after it starts
barring further postponements races 4 and 5 will be held sunday and tuesday no racing is scheduled monday because of the auckland anniversary day holiday in which other races will be held in the gulf to mark the city's 160th anniversary
prada or america one will face defending champion new zealand in the best-of-9 america's cup finals scheduled to start feb 19
conditions on sunday could be similar to last tuesday's when rough seas strong winds and heavy rain delayed the first race by 24 hours
forecasts though aren't always reliable especially on the hauraki gulf where wind direction can change substantially over a short time
all weather mcdavitt said is a mixture of pattern and chaos
from san diego to auckland to milan and now back to auckland
it's been a scenic and successful journey for a middle-aged california boat designer who looks as if he might be comfortable on a surfboard and once had the beach boys singing group backing his ill-fated america's cup syndicate
sometimes doug peterson likes to shoot from the lip so don't accuse him of being a traitor to the united states
he says he designs boats for america's cup teams trying to beat the united states because he wants the best chance of winning he thinks through his options then decides who to bestow his brilliance on
there is plenty of substance to peterson who at age 54 still has thick reddish-brown hair with a beard to match and is trying to win his third straight america's cup
he's a great genius said bill koch head of the america3 syndicate that won the 1992 cup in san diego with peterson on the design team he has that little bit of anti-establishment thinker about him which is great
three years later peterson was a winner again this time as a key designer for new zealand's black magic which was much faster than young america in sweeping all five races in the finals off san diego
he's a highly intelligent human being said john bertrand the australian winner of the 1983 america's cup who used a peterson-designed boat as part of his preparations that year he has an opinion on everything and generally that opinion is very well worth listening to
the italians thought so they hired him to design prada for this year's races good choice
the silver-hulled speedster would reach the america's cup finals against new zealand if it beats americaone in the best-of-9 challenger finals now under way amid the shifty winds on hauraki gulf
there's nothing new about people working for different countries than their own peterson said nothing new at all
born in los angeles and raised in san diego peterson moved to auckland after the 1992 races to meet the requirement that he live in the country for which he's working for two years before the america's cup
that changed to three years after the 1995 event so he moved to milan for the past five months he's been in auckland during the trials
my kids love the mobility i take them everywhere with me said peterson a father of three daughters and one son my youngest daughter lived with me for a year in milan and she learned italian much better than me
he did explore working for other syndicates he talked with dennis conner about the stars and stripes campaign in the end as the three-year deadline approached no team in america or elsewhere other than the italians had the financial stability to assure it would be able to compete he said
i want to win said peterson who denied that a bigger paycheck was a factor we were fully funded from day one so that looked like a combination to me because we could start doing things right away
should prada defeat americaone peterson would have a chance to beat one of his former employers sir peter blake his syndicate is defending the cup it won in 1995 in a boat peterson designed
there was an element on the team that didn't want me there this time peterson said hopefully they'll wish that they didn't let me go
after the 1992 event peterson talked with all three american defense syndicates preparing for 1995 conner's was one of them
after conner fell behind new zealand 2-0 in the finals peterson was told that conner once said designers are just necessary evils
his response i wonder how necessary dennis is right now
still peterson says he gets along with conner
once peterson and two friends began their own syndicate beach boys usa for the 1992 cup but funding fell short so he took his innovative ideas to koch
like all geniuses he has weaknesses he gets interested in some of the more unusual and creative aspects and sometimes leaves details for other people koch said he likes to think out of the mainstream
he would say well everybody is going for a short fat boat let's go for a long narrow boat' and not even test it he'd just say well let's go for it design it tomorrow'
we'd say gosh that's a very good idea but how long how narrow' it was that kind of interaction you need
if peterson and his prada design team are successful against americaone he'll move closer to his third straight america's cup
nothing personal just a job
a lot of our group and their group sailed together and are friends peterson said and they will continue to be friends there is a life beyond the america's cup
overtime losses will count both as a loss and a regulation tie

officials have agreed to stop housing more than two children in each room at the state's juvenile detention centers in response to the rape of a 13-year-old boy
beginning next week juveniles will sleep on the floor in common areas at the three centers with staff watching over them throughout night rather than be placed in rooms with two others
a court-appointed monitor urged officials to restructure the system after a 13-year-old boy was raped while in a room at the new haven detention center with three other boys two boys were arrested in the november attack
we'll do whatever it takes to keep this from happening again said judge john j ronan deputy chief court administrator who agreed to the change during a meeting thursday with monitor donald devore
populations at the three centers are 20 to 50 percent higher than goals set by a 1997 federal consent decree to improve living conditions
there has been a 35 percent increase in admissions in the last five years at the centers which typically house youths between the ages of 11 and 16
failure by the state department of children and families to quickly find placements for children under its care also was cited as a cause of the overcrowding
devore appointed in 1997 after a federal class-action lawsuit was brought against the state urged judicial officials on thursday to take immediate action
as long as we continue to put too many kids in these rooms it will be almost impossible to ensure safety devore told members of a task force appointed to study the overcrowding problem
in a september 1998 report on conditions at the new haven center devore warned state officials that overcrowding breeds violence illness and other problems
judicial officials responded at the time by taking several steps such as moving forward with plans to build larger facilities in hartford and bridgeport and creating alternative detention programs that gave them another 100 beds
officials said it's too soon to say exactly how the new system of putting juveniles in common rooms will work or how much it will cost
it's going to require staff members to sit out in those rooms all night and stay awake and watch devore said they're going to have to beef up staffing
ronan also agreed to devore's suggestion that the monitor improve the method used to identify youths who might be sexual predators those children are put in single rooms
the state will oversee the day-to-day operations of the financially-strapped opsail2000ct the new london-based tall ships celebration planned for this summer
the budget for the project will be scaled back from $7 million to $62 million and the governor's office has pledged to fill any budget gaps that exist to ensure the success of the event said john johnson opsail connecticut's chairman
when all is said and done i think the state contribution will be somewhere between $2 million and $3 million including the $700000 we already have said johnson who also is chairman of the state republican party's finance committee
retired maj gen david w gay the former head of the state's army national guard will become president of opsail and direct the group's day-to-day operations johnson said
the announcements were made after a meeting thursday in the governor's office
johnson will remain as chairman while rowland's co-chiefs of staff peter w ellef and sidney j holbrook will monitor opsail from the governor's office said dean pagani the governor's spokesman
general gay oversaw the state's preparations for y2k for gov rowland pagani said he's a very good hands-on manager especially when there's a special project that has a defined role and limited amount of time and the governor has a very high level of confidence in his ability to make sure this thing comes off without a hitch
pagani said there have been concerns especially with opsail's fund-raising among corporate sponsors he said gay also will look into the possibility that opsail's administrative expenses have been excessive
to date cash donations to the project total $165000 - well short of a $21 million target
in response opsail has hired madison square garden to head-up fund-raising efforts msg will receive a commission for each donation it brings in
at least 30 tall ships are expected to take part in opsail2000ct july 12-15 it is part of operation sail a national celebration of the millennium and america's 224th anniversary
operation sail is competing for tall ships with sail boston 2000 which is scheduled to take place the week of july 10
a key house subcommittee chairman is accusing the clinton administration of sabotaging the war on drugs by sharply reducing the pentagon's ability to interdict us-bound shipments
rep john mica r-fla based his allegation on a report by congressional investigators that said the number of flight hours devoted to counterdrug missions declined 68 percent from 1992 though 1999
the report by the general accounting office last month also said the number of ship days involved for the same purpose fell 62 percent during that period
this report confirms that the war on drugs did not fail but rather was dismantled by the clinton administration mica told a hearing of his house government reform committee's panel on criminal justice drug policy and human resources on thursday
rep benjamin gilman r-ny chairman of the house international relations committee said he was appalled by the report's findings
mica reacted sharply when ana maria salazar a deputy assistant secretary of defense said the pentagon remains committed to the administration's counterdrug strategy
i find this hard to believe mica said i find the war on drugs has been sabotaged
salazar noted there have been budget cuts for defense in the post-cold war era and some had an impact on the drug war including a $200 million cutback in 1994
she also said the diversion of radar planes from counternarcotics activities was another contributing factor other drug war assets were redeployed to bosnia and the middle east to help meet priority military contingencies she said
in his opening statement mica said few wars in us history have taken a greater toll in lives or imposed greater destruction and casualties on our society than the drug menace since 1993 he said more than 100000 americans have died in drug-related incidents including 15973 in 1998
jess ford an analyst for the gao - congress' investigative branch - said the florida-based us southern command told the gao that the pentagon was unable to meet 57 percent of the command's requests for intelligence surveillance and reconnaissance flights during the last fiscal year
ford said the southern command believes that the lack of assets hurt its ability to respond quickly to changing drug-trafficking patterns
tennessee titans owner bud adams is sharing the joy of his first super bowl by bringing 40 teen-agers from nashville for the game
the teen-agers were picked from six united way agencies for the trip of a lifetime
they were scheduled to leave tennessee today by bus and stay at the titans' hotel in atlanta adams said he has tickets waiting for them on the 50-yard line at the georgia dome and they will fly back to nashville on the team charter monday

super bet in what has become a yearly tradition the governors of the two states involved in the super bowl made a friendly wager over the outcome of sunday's game
missouri gov mel carnahan is betting tennessee gov don sundquist a case of st louis' celebrated toasted ravioli that the rams beat the titans
sundquist wagered a basket of tennessee food products including succulent tennessee ham
there's also a side bet to please animal lovers st louis-based ralston purina co agreed to donate 1000 pounds of animal food to the humane society of the winning governor's choice
i think this is a pretty fair proposition carnahan said i will be happy to taste test the tennessee ham to see whether it matches up to our missouri hams
sundquist said he loves italian food and i look forward to receiving the ravioli from gov carnahan after the titans' big win in the super bowl
toasted ravioli is a crunchy specialty that originated on the hill st louis' italian neighborhood in 1947 a cook at angelo's restaurant accidentally dropped ravioli - which is usually boiled - into a deep fryer
got milk the winning super bowl quarterback will appear in an ad in usa today on monday with the familiar got milk mustache
either kurt warner or steve mcnair will join terrell davis brett favre steve young reggie white john elway and chris chandler as past super bowl players who appeared in the milk ad
the man behind the star san diego chargers safety rodney harrison whose hit led to rams qb trent green being lost for the season with a knee injury and opened the way for kurt warner's mvp season says he should be the most popular man in st louis
to the people of st louis i just want to ask them are they still mad at me they hated me at first they cussed me out for two weeks but i haven't heard anything now i should be the most famous man in st louis now besides kurt warner he should be sending me part of his signing bonus he's gone from making $5 bagging groceries to being a $5 million quarterback if that hadn't happened then he probably never would have gotten an opportunity'
too small london fletcher figured he wasn't small enough
while everyone else fudges on their exact height and weight the st louis rams linebacker wanted everyone to know exactly how tall - or short - he really was so his height on the official roster was downsized from 6-foot to 5-10
and to be perfectly honest he's not that tall fletcher conceded thursday that he's probably a bit under 5-10 and he doesn't mind if the world knows all about it
i want to be an inspiration fletcher said i want to show the kids that they can succeed in life even when people say they are too small or too short
anyway what's an inch here and there after following this path to the super bowl
growing up with tragedy fletcher watches his mother battle drug addition for much of the past decade and endures the loss of a sister who was killed in a rape and beating 12 years ago
after attending st francis pa on a basketball scholarship the stocky point guard hangs around less than two years before transferring to division iii john carroll in his hometown of cleveland so he could be closer to family and friends a two-sport season is followed by a full-time switch to football and small-college stardom
but john carroll isn't the nfl overlooked in the draft fletcher takes a job in corporate america keeps himself in shape and sends out tapes to several teams in hopes of earning a tryout
st louis was one of the few teams that even noticed
i may look at a thousand of these tapes every year during the draft said charley armey the rams' vice president of player personnel i found london fletcher and i started researching the first thing i thought looking at the tape was this guy would be a great special teams player
so armey offered a contract and hoped he had found one of those obscure players who manages to slip onto the 53-man roster fletcher had other ideas
i will be back next year as your starting middle linebacker he told armey
fletcher was true to his word in training camp this season winning a three-way battle with charlie clemons and lorenzo styles then proceeded to show that size isn't everything
london set the tone for our defense teammate mike jones said he's so fiery and mad all the time no matter if we're down by two or up by 30
barely visible over the top of an offensive line the 241-pound fletcher ranged all over the field during the rams' improbable run to the nfc championship he led the team with 138 tackles 22 more than anyone else he had three sacks and pressured the quarterback eight more times for good measure he forced a fumble and broke up five passes
fletcher's teammates are keenly aware of the hurdles he overcame to start in sunday's super bowl against the tennessee titans
london has been a tremendous inspiration defensive tackle d'marco farr said he hits and he talks with the best of them too whenever we need a lift or something to make you laugh he is there he is our quarterback on defense
fletcher chatters constantly on the field rises from each tackle like he's saved the season and clearly relishes the spotlight as evidenced by his bare-chested biceps-flexing photo in sports illustrated's nfl preview issue
i thought i was crazy and a lunatic in the huddle farr said but london tells me to shut up because i'm interfering with his monologue
fletcher knew he has something to prove from his very first day with the rams
they saw this short guy walk into the locker room and probably thought i was a running back he recalled when they saw me at middle linebacker i'm sure they didn't take me too seriously but once the ball was snapped it didn't take them long to realize i was here and here to stay
at just his second practice fletcher scuffled with a teammate who tried to take advantage of the rookie before long everyone realized this was someone not to be annoyed
he plays like there's a chip on his shoulder said defensive end kevin carter who led the nfl in sacks
off the field fletcher presents a gentler facade he graduated from john carroll with a degree in sociology and enjoys talking with kids about the trials and tribulations that never held him back
i figured that god wouldn't give me more than i could handle he said besides football isn't a life or death thing for me even if i couldn't play football i know i would be a success in life
pentagon officials told a visiting chinese military delegation this week that us sales of defensive arms to taiwan will continue and that the reason taiwan wants to acquire american anti-missile defenses is to counter a recent buildup of chinese missiles within range of the island
this was one of several contentious issues raised during two days of talks at the pentagon - the first high-level chinese military contacts with the united states since the mistaken us bombing of china's embassy in belgrade last may
walter slocombe the undersecretary of defense for policy headed the us side in the talks he told reporters thursday that the clinton administration has made no decisions on selling missile defenses to taiwan
but we also made clear that one of the reasons why this is an issue is the buildup of chinese missile capability and that since we're talking about what is a sufficient defense capability obviously the level of chinese deployments is a relevant factor slocombe said he said he made clear to the chinese officials that we will continue our sale of defensive arms to taiwan although he would not discuss specific sales
taiwan and communist china split amid civil war 50 years ago the taiwanese government says it is willing to unify when china is more democratic and economically developed china considers taiwan a breakaway province and says it must eventually return
defense secretary william cohen said this week's talks produced agreement to resume normal us-china military ties
i think we are on track to getting military-to-military relations back at a normal state of affairs cohen told reporters during a photo-taking session in his office with british defense minister geoffrey hoon
cohen said he had a very cordial meeting wednesday with people's liberation army lt gen xiong guangkai and that the chinese officer extended an invitation for cohen to go to beijing cohen had to cancel a visit last year after the outbreak of nato's air war against yugoslavia he last visited china in january 1998
i was in fact invited to return to china cohen said i indicated that i would do so at a mutually convenient time he was not more specific but aides have said they believe cohen might go to china this spring
a cohen trip would be preceded by a visit to beijing by adm dennis blair commander in chief of the us pacific command officials said it was likely blair would make the trip in the next couple of months
slocombe said the talks totaling 12 hours tuesday and wednesday changed neither side's views on topics of disagreement such as taiwan and the pentagon's effort to build a nationwide defense against long-range missile attack
there were clear statements of strongly different views on a number of subjects slocombe said adding that there also were areas of agreement such as the need to prevent north korea from building nuclear arms
a former head of military intelligence xiong is deputy chief of the general staff of the people's liberation army he is one of china's most politically influential generals and is known for hard-line views on the united states he is a member of the ruling communist party's committee that sets policy toward taiwan
china agreed to send xiong to washington after the clinton administration said in mid-december it would seek $28 million from congress for the extensive bomb damage to china's embassy in belgrade china agreed to pay $287 million for damage done in reprisal attacks on the us embassy and consular offices in china
blaine bishop is the tennessee titans' own tasmanian devil
the strong safety flies around the field - stopping runners at the line of scrimmage zipping from side to side covering receivers or slashing into the backfield for a sack
rookie jevon kearse got most of the publicity this season but bishop has held the titans' defense together in this super bowl season and he does everything at 110 mph
he's ferocious tackle jason fisk said he's got it on all the time it's something in his personality when he gets out there on the football field don't make him mad he'll go crazy
rams running back marshall faulk the nfl's offensive player of the year said a runner always must be on the lookout for the bow-legged bishop
blaine's a crafty safety he loves getting big shots on you and he's a guy who's smart he'll get the sure tackle you have to be careful when playing blaine bishop faulk said
not bad for a guy no one wanted when he came out of high school who had to walk on at ball state and then waited until the eighth round of the nfl draft in 1993 before hearing his telephone ring
he's probably my favorite guy i've ever coached titans defensive coordinator gregg williams said
people tell you all the things he can't do he can't backpedal he can't turn his hips but he really gets after it when i first saw him i wanted to know those same things but my opinion changed completely when we put him in a helmet and pads
bishop now has the respect of the nfl he has been to the pro bowl three times and the titans designated him their franchise player just before they left houston for tennessee in 1997 they re-signed him for six years and $18 million
but he still sees himself as a scrawny player trying to convince coaches that yes he can play football
they think i'm crazy i feel like not only myself but the team doesn't get a lot of respect bishop said
his teammates see bishop as a defensive coordinator on the field and a tireless defender who has led the team in tackles three of the last five seasons he's best when telling people what he thinks
he's not a guy who's worried about your feelings free safety anthony dorsett said if he doesn't think you're going to get the job done he will let you know
linebacker joe bowden has never seen someone as intense as bishop
he'll get in your face slap you around cuss and talk crazy bowden said
it's easy to be intense when no one ever gave you a chance to do what you love growing up in indiana bishop dreamed of playing for the fighting irish of notre dame or the blue and maize of michigan neither school called actually nobody offered the 5-foot-9 203-pound bishop a college scholarship
always the tweener a step too slow to play corner and too short to play safety bishop said
he worked his way into college by heading first to st joseph's in rensselaer ind for a year then he walked on at ball state where he was a team captain by the time he graduated
bishop thought he got the attention of nfl scouts at the blue-gray game a bruised shoulder limited his play at the senior bowl though and he went through nearly two days of the draft without hearing his name called
the sixth round passed and i turned it off and started doing my term paper he said
the then-oilers finally called in the eighth round and they chose bishop with the 214th pick overall - perhaps their best draft find in a decade when they got players like left tackle brad hopkins quarterback steve mcnair running back eddie george and kearse with no 1 picks
bishop has been a big key to the titans' playoff run he credits pittsburgh lineman shar pourdanesh with helping him crank up his intensity for the playoffs pourdanesh poked him in the eye in the titans' regular-season finale and bishop said he realized then he would have to play even harder
i didn't realize that i could take it up even higher from that point on i've been playing with a lot of intensity he said
taz himself would be proud
it's not likely dick vermeil will ever shed a tear for isaac bruce
but the st louis rams' often-emotional coach realizes he doesn't have to be on great terms with a player to recognize the greatness in the game
vermeil's so-called superstar barb directed at bruce three years ago has kept the relationship on a polite level even though bruce said he long ago put aside the slight vermeil had been responding to bruce's criticism of teammates accusing them of quitting after a game
i never had any hard feelings toward coach vermeil and the things that happened a couple years ago bruce said i immediately crushed them
it was telling though when vermeil who cried when he cut backup tight end aaron laing in 1998 training camp had a more or less matter-of-fact tone when discussing bruce's automobile accident in december bruce rolled his mercedes twice after blowing a tire and wasn't wearing a seat belt yet walked away without a scratch
fortunately he's ok vermeil said then he's bumped and bruised and ruined a nice car
for his part bruce has consistently hesitated to give vermeil the lion's share of the credit for the rams' startling turnaround
none of which has affected bruce's performance on the field he's had better years statistically speaking such as 1995 when he caught 119 passes second highest in nfl history his 77-catch output this year is third-best in his career also trailing his 84-reception season in 1996
but the super bowl season may represent the pinnacle for bruce even though he spent so much time watching from the bench unlike the previous two years when bruce was dogged by hamstring problems and missed a total of 15 games the problem this season was that the rams were simply too good
st louis' average winning margin of 18 points meant that to see perhaps the nfl's most elusive receiver famous for his on-a-dime cutbacks you had to get to the stadium early his numbers were down a bit mostly because he played in the fourth quarter only six times
his numbers would have been astronomical had we been in situations where we were going into the two-minute offense to win the game receivers coach al saunders said this may have been his best year although the numbers don't speak to that
quarterback kurt warner isn't bashful about sharing the glory from his 41-touchdown pass mvp season
i've often said that i think isaac is the best receiver out there or at least the best receiver that i've ever played with warner said you can't say enough about what he can do
for his part bruce again showed he doesn't matter who he works with five quarterbacks have thrown him the ball since the rams' move to st louis in 1995 and he and warner established a bond on the basis of one preseason game after trent green's knee injury
we had to do it quick bruce said he didn't get many reps in training camp but i've had a lot of quarterbacks since i've been here and i think i can play with a lot of people
after a quiet outing in the nfc championship game against tampa bay bruce is looking forward to more action he caught only three passes for 22 yards against the buccaneers' zone which double-teamed him all day and the titans likely will play man-to-man
titans cornerback denard walker is looking forward to the challenge
he's a guy who does like to talk a lot of noise and likes to get in your head walker said we can't bow down to playing isaac bruce's game if we get down to playing his game i think he's going to light us up
under the picturesque capitol dome fire hazards are so serious they violate federal law and are a potential threat to human life congressional investigators have concluded
the congressional office of compliance on thursday cited a lack of fire barriers inadequate exit signs and exit capacity deficient emergency lighting limited sprinkler coverage and dangerous storage of flammable and toxic materials in the capitol and surrounding office buildings
although all of the buildings do not have all of these problems there is a regrettable consistency throughout the complex in the lack of proper testing and maintenance of major electrical systems and of fire safety systems such as sprinklers suppression systems and emergency generators the report said
the study was the latest reproach against the architect of the capitol who maintains congressional buildings and grounds the architect's office let the level of fire safety in the complex slip far below that of most other american office buildings of similar size and age the congressional inspectors found
the hazards are not only a violation of federal law governing employee health and safety but also a potential threat to human life the compliance office reported
architect of the capitol alan m hantman responded to the findings by insisting the us capitol and its associated buildings are a safe work environment
it is true that life safety systems need improvement but capitol hill is a safer place today that it was three years ago it will be safer still in each successive year he said
hantman said improvements cannot be accomplished overnight because of many factors including inconveniencing congressional operations and appropriateness for these national treasures
the office of compliance enforces the congressional accountability act which forces congress to obey many of the health and safety laws enforced elsewhere in the country the office has issued numerous health and safety citations to the architect
in december 1998 the house inspector general reported the capitol and five house office buildings were firetraps that left visitors members of congress and employees with an undue risk of loss of life and property
the safety report released thursday found that fire barriers to prevent the spread of fire smoke and toxic gases were either totally absent or inadequate in capitol buildings
this danger is most severe in the main capitol building and the three oldest congressional office buildings the report said
none of these four buildings has a single exit stairwell that would be effectively protected against smoke or toxic gases in the event of fire the inspectors reported
the capitol and other office buildings all have sprinklers in only very limited areas the study found
the problem was compounded by installation of omega sprinkler heads some 14000 of the 30000 installed were found to be defective although the manufacturer is replacing them under a settlement with the consumer product safety commission
the architect was totally lacking or deficient in conducting any maintenance and testing program of the sprinklers inspectors said
the report said that in the rayburn house office building built in the early 1960s none of the eight stairwells have doors designed to withstand the spread of smoke and fire
a number of exits involve revolving doors which can impede quick exit they noted
exit signs are not visible in many locations the compliance office found and some directed people away from the nearest exit
the report also found that compressed gas cylinders were improperly stored in poorly ventilated basement areas in three buildings while the cylinders were removed the report noted that citations were previously issued to the architect for similar violations
good thing the tennessee titans played their way into the super bowl it doesn't look they'll be playing host to the big game any time soon
wintry weather has plagued atlanta which endured frigid temperatures and braced today for an approaching storm that threatened to dump up to three inches of snow
nfl commissioner paul tagliabue said he didn't think the prospect of shivering fans trekking through a snowbound city would damage atlanta's chances of landing another super bowl after all sunday's game between the titans and st louis rams will be played in the comfy georgia dome
we always understood this game was part southern part northern he said thursday the key thing is the quality of the stadium and having a domed stadium
in the nfl's version of geography 101 deep south atlanta has the potential to become a northern city in late january ditto for nashville and charlotte two other cities that have considered bidding for the game
both the titans and carolina panthers play in stadiums that have opened since 1996 but neither has a roof
this week could have an impact on some northern cities that were hoping to get the game in an open-air stadium tagliabue said this shows us that winter is still winter in the united states
other cities that might be affected baltimore and washington which have built open-air stadiums in the last two years cincinnati and pittsburgh both constructing facilities without a roof and philadelphia where the eagles are seeking a new stadium
even with a covered stadium the problems of taking the game to a cold-weather city were magnified by the unseasonable spell in atlanta
i know a lot of fans who worried about the weather and how they're going to get here titans owner bud adams said it's a big factor
the nfl scrambled to plan for the worst-case scenario knowing that hotlanta is hardly equipped to cope with severe winter weather forecasters provided a bit of good news projecting less snow and ice for the atlanta area by nightfall
still the league was concerned that icy roads would prevent local workers from reaching hotels restaurants and other businesses catering to super bowl visitors
we know a couple of inches here can totally shut things down said jim steeg the league vice president of special events
the national weather service said 1-3 inches of snow was expected today with a chance of sleet and freezing rain saturday
before the winter storm even arrived it started having an impact on the city
delta air lines a primary passenger carrier into and out of atlanta has already started cancelling and delaying inbound flights
with the expected bad weather in mind the titans and rams were given permission to move their final two days of workouts to the georgia dome they held their first practices outside wednesday in bitterly cold temperatures but were more comfortable thursday as the mercury climbed from 19 to 43 degrees and the wind settled down
meanwhile extra generators were in place to keep power running at the dome some hotels set aside rooms to house their own employees in case roads became impassable the teams were advised to anticipate delays in their travel itineraries
after wednesday's workout several rams complained that it was virtually impossible to concentrate in the frosty conditions
it's tough when you're trying to practice for the biggest game of the year and you have to go out in that kind of weather rams safety keith lyle said you're freezing no one wants to catch the ball no one wants to bump into each other
the dome was not available to the teams wednesday and thursday it was being used for pregame and halftime show rehearsals as well as other game preparations but the nfl altered its scheduled today cutting short another rehearsal so the titans and rams could use the stadium for 1 1/2-hour practices in the afternoon
the nfl addressed another weather-related problem the giant outdoor tent that was used for news conferences at tennessee's team hotel
when the titans met with the media wednesday morning it was not much warmer in the tent than the 26-degree temperatures on the outside but 16 additional heaters were brought in thursday bringing the inside temperature to a downright sweltering 71
it's hotter than fish grease in here said titans linebacker barron wortham stripping off his heavy coat to reveal a short-sleeve shirt underneath
one thing is certain the game will be played even in the most dire conditions steeg pointed out that the city's rapid transit system connects the downtown hotel district to the stadium a few blocks away
the city is just recovering from an ice storm last weekend that knocked out power to hundreds of thousands in north georgia
last week may have been a blessing to us steeg said i'm sure it's not to the people who are still without power but it's made everyone aware of the need to get ready with another storm coming
for sale by owner beautiful country home three bedroom two bath and high ceilings set amid 25 acres of secluded lakes and hills in the ozarks broken dreams not included
for nearly a year arlyne and darrell barnes tried to give their dream retirement home away in a contest anyone interested was to send $100 and an essay on why they wanted the home
the couple hoped to raise enough money to pay off their mortgage and set some money aside to pay for a private investigation into their son's unsolved death
but too few people entered the contest now with bills from lawyers and private investigators piling up the couple has dropped the contest and put the house up for sale
it's really a shame mrs barnes said thursday but the fact that we made so many new friends and received so many prayers made it all worth the effort
the house is being listed as $159900 well below its appraised price of $200000 we have so many bills and loans we are going to lose it if we don't sell it mrs barnes said
only 613 people entered the contest their money has been refunded
the couple had hoped to raise at least $50000 to pay for a private investigation into the death of mitchell krupp mrs barnes' 29-year-old son from a previous marriage
krupp's home near brentwood ark burned in july 1997 in a blaze authorities say was deliberately set investigators found krupp's remains between the springs of his bed mattress along with the remains of a shotgun a lead shot was found in his skull
investigators said the fire destroyed so much evidence they may never learn how he died the case remains open
mrs barnes says she believes her son was murdered and his death made to look like a suicide she has filed a wrongful death lawsuit against krupp's wife of six years pam worrell both mrs barnes and her lawyer charles kester declined comment on the pending lawsuit
having exhausted their life savings on investigators and lawyers the couple needed money the contest idea was inspired by the spitfire grill a 1996 movie in which an elderly woman makes her restaurant the prize in a similar giveaway
they had built the home nine years ago as a place to retire with a view of a private trout-stocked lake a separate workshop an indoor pool cathedral ceilings and a wraparound porch it seemed a sure bet that people would bid $100 for a chance
they announced the contest last february with a deadline of june 15 with entries lagging they extended the deadline to september 15
now having fallen short of their goal of 1800 entries mrs barnes said she doesn't know what's next for her and her husband
it's been 2 1/2 years since my son died she said we never planned on any of this
a nonprofit group called voices of victims has shown interest in turning the property into its national headquarters and a retreat for grieving families of murdered children but the organization doesn't have a lot of money and mrs barnes says she can't wait for members to raise it
wanting to create something positive from the contest mrs barnes said she may compile the essays she received into a book
she said several people wrote of loved ones who also had died under mysterious and unsolved circumstances
it really opened our eyes to the number of unsolved murders there are out there she said we were truly inspired to continue seeking the truth in my son's case
chase manhattan corp's decision to ask account holders before selling their names to outside marketers may prompt other banks to offer similar privacy protections
if chase can do it that means other banks can do it frank torres legislative counsel for consumers union said about the new settlement agreement between chase and new york state's attorney general
but most big banks aren't ready to do that and states ultimately might compel them to tighten their privacy practices torres said thursday
at the same time financial institutions are concerned about recent privacy enforcement actions against banks by several states as well as an initiative by some states to enact new privacy laws that are stricter than federal requirements congress established in november
the states are fully engaged said john byrne senior counsel for the american bankers association banks around the country are taking stock of their privacy procedures he said some banks will decide on their own to go beyond the mandated procedures if that's what their customers want to see
under the agreement chase must have written consent from account holders before it can sell or share their data with outside marketers
under the settlement accord announced tuesday by attorney general eliot spitzer in albany ny chase agreed to stop providing outside marketers with the credit line and balance information of customers as many as 22 million consumers had been affected chase the nation's third-largest bank holding company has some $370 billion in assets
the case really demonstrates the need for legislation that protects consumers from having their personal sensitive financial information distributed outside of the bank said barry steinhardt associate director of the american civil liberties union i hope other banks follow chase but i'm not optimistic
new york city-based chase agreed not to share any customer data with outside marketers such as telemarketers without customers' express written consent even in cases where customers do give their permission chase agreed to provide only their names addresses and telephone numbers to the marketing firms but not any financial data
this is stricter than the privacy provision in the new federal law which allows banks and other financial institutions to share customers' data with outside firms unless customers expressly ask them not to do so
the financial services industry had opposed even this more lenient requirement it won the right in the legislation for banks securities firms and insurance companies that are affiliated under the same corporate roof to share customers' data customers are unable to stop such sharing by affiliated financial companies
the case involving chase arose from an investigation by spitzer's office into allegations that the bank had provided customer information to marketers in violation of its own privacy policy as disclosed to consumers the data it shared was said to have included encrypted account numbers and loan data
the marketing firms used the information to phone chase customers to try selling them emergency road service plans discount shopping clubs legal services travel clubs garden supplies and magazine subscriptions chase received a commission on successful sales
while it agreed to the settlement chase denied any wrongdoing state officials said they hadn't accused the bank of anything illegal but they promised to pursue similar enforcement actions against other financial companies
three-fourths of americans see president clinton as a skillful communicator the same percentage who felt that way about president reagan during his last year in office a new poll says
but while they think clinton's ability to get his message across equals that of the former republican president who was often called the great communicator they gave reagan higher marks on leadership
the abc news poll said just over half consider clinton a good or excellent leader compared with two-thirds of americans in 1988 who said reagan was a good or excellent leader
the abc poll of 515 adults taken jan 26 had an error margin of plus or minus 45 percentage points
on ratings of his accomplishments clinton's ability to communicate and his judgment as president clinton in the year 2000 is rated very similarly to reagan in 1988 said abc pollster gary langer noting that both were rated good or excellent in their judgment by fewer than half reagan scored better on another attribute leadership
people were divided on whether clinton would be remembered as an above-average president or below average with just over a third choosing each but two-thirds of americans in 1988 thought reagan would go down in history as an above-average president
clinton fared better than reagan on public judgment of his handling of two key areas the economy and the federal deficit clinton was judged as excellent or good on the economy by 68 percent compared with 49 percent for reagan and clinton got a good or excellent mark on handling the federal deficit from 55 percent compared with 16 percent for reagan
when people were asked whether they would be happy to see clinton go when his term is up in a year more than half said they will be glad to see him go
tens of thousands of cubans - joined by visiting us college baseball players - marched by torchlight through the streets of havana early today to commemorate an independence hero and demand the return of 6-year-old elian gonzalez
a dramatic sea of flickering lights flooded down the broad steps of the university of havana at midnight as a predominantly student crowd marched several blocks to a monument for jose marti the crowd occasionally broke into chants of fidel fidel for cuban president fidel castro
we continue in open frontal combat for our elian kidnapped in the claws of the mafia of miami said speaker julio martinez a senior official of the union of communist youth to a tightly packed crowd waving cuban flags
return elian to the fatherland socialism or death fatherland or death we will triumph he shouted
the march was held to mark the 147th anniversary of the birth of marti a poet and leader of cuba's struggle for independence from spain
the government has staged events almost nightly for two months to demand the return of elian who was rescued nov 25 while clinging to an innertube off the coast of florida after a shipwreck that killed his mother and 10 other people
elian's great-uncle in the united states backed by the anti-castro cuban american national foundation is fighting in the courts to keep the child from being returned to his father in cuba
marching near the front ranks of the midnight parade were baseball players from the university of st thomas in st paul minn who on wednesday played a game against the university of havana and are visiting educational and cultural sites
we decided as a team we would participate in this just as a sign of friendship said jake mauer 21 of st paul
the visit to an island off-limits to most americans seemed to have impressed the players who said they had been received warmly by cubans
i thought they were a lot of repressed people and didn't care for fidel but it's totally the opposite said joseph larson 21 of minneapolis
the university's president rev dennis dease said he hoped that the game and other educational exchanges with the university of havana will make a small contribution to normalizing relations between our two countries
as for elian i hope that that little boy comes home here this is where he belongs dease said
earlier cuban officials and elian's father juan miguel gonzalez expressed anger at the treatment elian's grandmothers received in a meeting with the boy in miami on wednesday
i felt very indignant gonzalez told reporters in havana they just ruined everything
gonzalez complained because the grandmothers' cellular phones were confiscated he had been unable to speak with his son during the meeting during all previous conversations with the boy since elian was rescued members of the family fighting gonzalez for custody have been present
ricardo alarcon president of the national assembly and fidel castro's top man for cuba-us relations complained that anti-communist protests held near the meeting place intruded on the meeting and said the miami relatives and their backers were given special privileges

a prosecutor says a prominent doctor lied to insurance companies to force them to pay for infertility treatments but his lawyer describes his client as the victim
there was no fraud you will see defense attorney theodore d wells said thursday during opening statements in the case against dr niels lauersen
lauersen an obstetrician and gynecologist and dr magda binion an anesthesiologist are being tried on charges of conspiracy health care fraud and mail fraud in connection with an alleged 10-year scheme to falsely bill fertility surgeries that were not covered by insurance as gynecological surgeries which were
assistant us attorney christine chung told jurors lauersen was a thief as she outlined her case in us district court in manhattan
ripping somebody off that's what the evidence is going to show these doctors did they stole millions of dollars by telling lies year after year after year she said
wells portrayed his 63-year-old client as a hero to patients struggling to have a child
he acknowledged lauersen often didn't bill insurance companies for laboratory work that matched sperm and eggs before inserting the combination into women
but he said the doctor was nearly always able to bill the insurance company accurately for treatment of the underlying physical problems preventing pregnancies
this is going to be an exciting case wells said it's a real case it's about my client's life
dozens of prosecutors crowded the courtroom along with supporters of lauersen including women he had treated
as wells finished some supporters applauded prompting judge william h pauley to admonish this is not a theater this is not a sports arena there will be no applause
lauersen the author of it's your body has appeared frequently on television and in publications as an expert on fertility matters which make up about 10 percent of his practice
chung said the conspiracy started in 1987 as lauersen falsely charged insurance companies $7500 at least 500 times collecting at least $22 million
he decided he was going to lie and defraud and cheat the insurance companies chung said for every patient he had - rich poor or somewhere in between - this is what he did
she said he alleged on forms that women were bleeding or in pain requiring surgical procedures
there was no bleeding there was no pain there was no problem the women were there because they were trying to have a baby chung said
the scheme was unearthed by suspicious insurance companies one of which checked their files over a seven-year period and found lauersen led every doctor in the country in almost every category for which he submitted claims the prosecutor said
she said former patients would testify along with a doctor who formerly worked with lauersen
chung warned the jury to forget the infertility debate
the case is not about whether fertility procedures are a good or a bad thing she said they bring joy to a lot of people
wells said prosecutors were relying on false accusations and distortions of the truth
he said the doctor who will testify against his client was a former drug addict who stole drugs from lauersen for his personal use
the lawyer said his client also was sloppy with paperwork because he was overworked
he had to use some standard forms and some of his paperwork is screwed up but that does not make him a criminal he said
repeatedly wells told the jury his client was dealing with big insurance companies as he treated a mix of patients so diverse in income and background that it could rival the united nations in makeup
he noted that his client was outspoken about the failure of insurance companies to treat women equally
bell atlantic and gte corp are taking steps to convince regulators that their proposed merger would benefit consumers and comply with federal law
the two companies tried to address the thorniest issues associated with the deal which would create the nation's largest local phone company in a filing thursday with the federal communications commission
to complete the merger originally valued at $52 billion the companies formally proposed spinning off gte's internet assets into a separate public corporation those assets consist of gte's internet backbone of massive data pipelines that crisscross the country carrying computer traffic for regulatory purposes this constitutes long-distance service which bell companies are not allowed to offer within their local calling boundaries without receiving fcc approval
bell atlantic in december secured fcc permission to offer long-distance in new york state only but it could take years before it gets the ability to provide long-distance throughout its local calling region of 13 states and the district of columbia
under the proposal gte's internet assets would be transferred into a new public corporation that would be 90 percent owned and controlled by public shareholders the merged bell atlanticgte would have a 10 percent voting and economic interest in the company but with an option of increasing its ownership to 80 percent within five years from the closing of the merger that gives the companies time to win needed regulatory approval to own the internet backbone
gte also would stop providing regular long-distance calling service in states that are within the bell atlantic region - aside from new york - as required by law
taking a cue from the long list of conditions that sbc and ameritech agreed to when those two companies combined in the fall bell atlantic and gte made commitments to extend their reach outside of the calling area they now serve
the businesses said they would spend $500 million within three years of closing the merger to compete with local companies in regions beyond their current territory providing rival telephone services or internet connections to customers in other bell regions
they also pledged to establish a separate affiliate for providing internet services roll out data connections to rural and low-income areas and set up enforcement plans to make sure they follow through on merger commitments
analysts said the plan laid out by the companies could go a long way in persuading regulators
it will resolve the last major hurdle said rex g mitchell an analyst with banc of america securities in san francisco he said the fcc may be open to the internet spin-off plan - and the possibility of the two companies regaining a majority share of those assets in five years - because that market is currently dominated by the three long-distance companies
the justice department already has approved bell atlantic's merger with gte as well as its wireless partnership with vodafone airtouch the companies hope to close the deal in the first or second quarter of this year
go ahead gary make my day
that could be the sentiment behind filmmaker michael moore's decision to take his throng of 100 moshers to new hampshire to challenge the presidential candidates to dive in for democracy and body surf the electorate
republican candidate alan keyes jumped into moore's mosh pit on the eve of the iowa caucuses which irritated gop rival gary bauer bauer said the move was undignified and criticized keyes for it wednesday night in a pre-new hampshire primary debate
moore had promised the endorsement of his political cable program the awful truth to the first candidate to jump into the pit
a mosh pit is a crowd of people typically just in front of the stage who catch a performer who jumps into the crowd
moore says he's willing to give the six remaining candidates - including bauer - a chance to dive in
we are willing to multiple-endorse just like the big money people do when they write big checks to both the democrats and republicans he said in a statement thursday
plus to be known as the only group to have endorsed alan keyes is something we may never be able to live with and we are hoping to rectify that in new hampshire

un talks to establish rules for trading in genetically modified organisms are nearing an end according to the talks' chairman who said he expected a draft agreement by this afternoon
we are very close said colombian environment minister juan mayr who has led this week's talks in montreal since they began monday i hope we will find a solution
the previous round held in february in cartagena colombia collapsed when the united states and five other countries refused to accept the biosafety protocol - an international agreement intended to prevent environmental damage due to trade in genetically engineered organisms
the european union and developing nations have argued that countries should be allowed to decline imports of genetically modified goods because little is known about their environmental effects
modern biotechnology is very young said tewolde egziabher head of the ethiopian delegation therefore being cautious is a necessity
but the united states and its partners - canada australia argentina chile and uruguay - have disagreed saying that the proposed rules in their current form would restrict trade those countries argued that any country's refusal to import a genetically modified product should be backed by scientific evidence in the form of a risk assessment
there was also concern the agreement on genetically altered goods relate to other agreements particularly to those of the world trade organization
what we agree here should not be undermined later in the context of the world trade organization said european commission environment minister margot wallstrom we believe it is not right and it is not fair to subordinate this agreement to the wto
about 70 million acres of genetically engineered crops were planted worldwide in 1999
in the united states 25 percent of the corn is genetically engineered as are 40 percent of planted soybeans
new england patriots owner bob kraft has learned the value of a good coach
and he didn't want to let another one get away
after having watched the team regress after bill parcells left for the new york jets kraft decided a first-round draft choice was a reasonable cost for a coach who could reverse the patriots' slide so kraft decided to pay the jets' price as compensation for bill belichick
perhaps the new england patriots - well maybe they'd be playing in atlanta today kraft said wistfully on thursday when asked if he had any regrets about his efforts to stabilize the team's coaching since parcells left
here's our chance to solve our problems with all positions in the organization someone who gives me peace of mind that he knows what he's doing he knows what it takes to win and that's why we're all in this business kraft said thursday after hiring belichick
for a no 1 draft choice we can bring in a man that i feel certain can do something rather than the uncertainty of a draft choice and it wasn't even close when i thought about it that way
the patriots will give new york their no 1 draft pick this year and a fourth- and seventh-rounder in 2001 the jets gave the patriots a no 5 in 2001 and a no 7 in 2002
it took 24 days for the patriots and jets to agree on compensation for belichick and a couple hours for kraft and his would-be coach to reach an agreement somewhere off the highway between boston and new york
the deal came so quickly kraft claimed that there wasn't time to discuss whether belichick would also take over as general manager asked why he hasn't made belichick the general manager kraft said we'll think about that thank you for suggesting it
belichick said he wasn't concerned about having total control of the team
this is not a one-man band here i can't play all the instruments he said i don't think it's important who's right i think it's important what's right
belichick was 37-45 as coach of the cleveland browns and an assistant with new england when the patriots went to the 1997 super bowl he went to the jets with parcells when the coach had a falling out with kraft over total control saying if they want you to cook the dinner at least they ought to let you shop for some of the groceries
the jets tried to make belichick their coach and parcells a consultant to get around the fact that parcells was still under contract then with new england when commissioner paul tagliabue rejected that arrangement new york gave new england four draft picks and made belichick the contractually designated heir to parcells
parcells took the jets to the afc title game in just two years spawning a rivalry with the jilted new england fans and letting the bad feelings with kraft stew the two did not speak for three years
instead of letting parcells do the shopping kraft gave that authority to bobby grier and hired pete carroll as coach the team got worse in each of the three seasons under that arrangement dissolving parcells' super bowl team into a fifth-place finisher with an 8-8 record
carroll was fired with two years left on his five-year contract but before the patriots could get permission to talk to belichick parcells resigned and belichick was automatically made coach
a day later belichick quit telling unsuspecting reporters that he had misgivings about the job because the jets were for sale
hopefully this press conference will go a little bit better than the last one i had belichick joked thursday hopefully my tenure here will be a little bit longer
tagliabue and a federal judge said belichick was stuck with the jets leaving him in limbo while the patriots decided whether he was worth a first-round choice
any time you give up a first-round draft pick that's something you obviously don't want to do said quarterback drew bledsoe who was among the players who lobbied for belichick but to get a coach of the caliber of bill belichick it's probably a worthwhile thing to do
parcells said his conversation with kraft ended the border war and allows both of them to look back on the team's afc championship with something other than bitterness
it resolves a lot of issues lingering a long time and helps bill get back into coaching where he wants to be parcells said i think bob has the coach he wants and we were compensated pretty well

utah lawmakers have voted down a bill that would have established a special prosecutor to investigate abuse and fraud in polygamous communities
the house bill killed by a vote of 28-43 on thursday would have allocated $200000 to hire a special prosecutor to probe crimes of welfare fraud tax fraud domestic abuse and sexual abuse in polygamous societies
the bill's sponsor salt lake city republican ron bigelow said investigators are needed because polygamist societies are generally secretive making uncovering crime difficult
do we say because you choose this particular lifestyle and it's hard to investigate we're simply going to ignore it you suffer these crimes you go ahead and let your children be abused' he asked
opponents argued the measure targeted an entire group of people based on their religious beliefs
utah was required to outlaw polygamy in its constitution as a condition of statehood and the crime of plural marriage has only been prosecuted a handful of times
but two years ago two prominent members of the kingston polygamous clan were accused of child abuse both men were convicted
that case along with reports of rampant welfare fraud in the polygamous sister-cities of colorado city and hildale prompted heightened scrutiny of such abuses
there are an estimated 25000 people living in polygamy in utah many of whom trace their beliefs back to fundamental mormonism mainstream mormonism has disavowed the practice

former us military chief john shalikashvili was appointed by secretary of state madeleine albright today to head a team trying to convince skeptical senators that a worldwide ban on nuclear testing is in the best interest of the united states
but the administration has no plans to seek another senate vote on the treaty this year its final one in office said state department spokesman james p rubin
the senate rejected the treaty last year with arguments that safeguards against cheating by other countries were inadequate and that the united states had to continue testing to keep its nuclear arsenal up to date only 48 senators 19 short of the 67 required voted for the treaty
albright was announcing the new initiative today as she arrived for the world economic forum a conference of more than 500 top corporate executives from around the world and scores of government officials including president clinton at davos a plush ski resort
rubin said a task force led by shalikashvili former chairman of the joint chiefs of staff will aim ultimately for approval of the landmark arms-control measure
we think this effort is important for its own sake to develop support for ratification and additionally because it signals the world that the united states is interested in ratifying the treaty rubin said
shalikashvili and other top american military commanders supports the ban on further underground nuclear weapons tests the only kind not banned in past treaties
albright intends to see palestinian leader yasser arafat while she is in switzerland to try to make headway on the framework of an accord for israel that is due by feb 13
the philippines and taiwan partially settled an aviation dispute friday that severed air links between them for nearly four months and agreed to resume flights next monday president joseph estrada said
philippine and taiwanese officials signed a letter of understanding at the presidential palace allowing the resumption of flight service estrada said
this is a very happy ending this agreement will enhance our trade relations with taiwan he said
the agreement was signed by eva estrada kalaw who heads manila's de facto embassy in taiwan and chan shien-ching taiwan's chief representative in manila and witnessed by estrada and philippine airlines majority stockholder lucio tan
air links were cut in early october after the philippines scrapped a 1996 aviation pact accusing taiwanese carriers china airlines and eva air of competing unfairly with ailing philippine airlines
the 1996 agreement allowed each country's airlines to fly a total of 9600 passengers between manila and taiwan weekly the philippines says taiwanese airlines unfairly poached passengers from pal by carrying them from the philippines to third countries
the new agreement allows each side to fly a maximum of 4800 passengers between manila and taiwan weekly further negotiations will be held on whether taiwan will be allowed to carry passengers from the philippines to third countries
the us economy grew at a sizzling 58 percent annual rate during the final three months of 1999 chalking up a year of remarkable prosperity as the nation heads into its longest economic expansion in history
for all of 1999 the nation's gross domestic product - the total output of goods and services - increased by 4 percent turning in three straight years where growth was 4 percent or higher the commerce department said today strength came from hardy consumer spending in 1998 the economy grew by 43 percent
the fourth-quarter rate was stronger than the 51 percent rate many analysts were forecasting it marked the strongest growth since a 59 percent rate posted in the final three months of 1998 robust consumer spending and a buildup in business inventories added to 1999's fourth-quarter growth while the trade deficit subtracted from it in the third quarter the economy grew by a breakneck 57 percent rate
the federal reserve meets next week to decide interest rate policy and most economists expect the fed to boost rates by a quarter of a percentage point on feb 2 to slow the red-hot economy and keep inflation from escalating
fed chairman alan greenspan in an appearance before congress this week pledged to do the best he can to keep the economic expansion going the economy is about to enter its 107 month of uninterrupted growth in february surpassing the 106-month record set in 1969
even though the fed raised rates three times last year the economy continues to grow at a rapid pace that some economists fear cannot be sustained without later triggering inflation
an inflation gauge tied to gdp rose 15 percent in 1999 a worse showing on inflation than the 07 percent increase recorded the year before in the fourth quarter the inflation measure rose 23 percent up from 17 percent posted in the third quarter
separately the labor department said its employment cost index - considered the best measure of changes in wages and benefit costs and closely watched by greenspan - rose 11 percent in the fourth quarter well above the 09 percent increase many analysts were expecting
both reports contain the smoking gun that the fed has been worried about - wage pressures are surfacing and inflation is on the uptick said first union economist david orr
economists said the reports raise the odds that the fed will follow up the expect rate increase in february with another one in march
worried about the prospects of rising inflation the bond market tumbled bond prices fell as yields on the bellwether 30-year treasury bonds rose to 660 percent from 652 percent late thursday
the booming us economy has been powered by consumer spending which accounts for two-thirds of all economy activity
the government said today that consumer spending rose at an annual rate of 53 percent in the fourth quarter and 53 percent for the year plentiful jobs low inflation and stock and bond market gains have made americans feel wealthy and put them in the mood to spend
meanwhile the nation's savings rate - savings as a percentage of disposable income - was pulled to a record quarterly low of 19 percent in the fourth quarter from 21 percent in the previous quarter for all of 1999 the savings rate hit an all-time annual low of 24 percent in 1998 the savings rate was 37 percent
businesses - confident that consumers will keep spending - increased their stockpiles to $654 billion in the fourth quarter up from $38 billion in the third quarter
business investment - spending on new equipment and plants - rose at an annual rate of 25 percent in the fourth quarter down from a 109 percent rate in the third quarter for the year business investment increased 83 percent compared with 127 percent in 1998
housing construction meanwhile fell by a 12 percent rate in the fourth quarter following a 38 percent rate of decline in the previous quarter reflecting the steady rise in mortgage rates in 1999 housing construction rose 72 percent but was down from a 92 percent increase the year before
the us trade deficit continued to be a drag on the nation's economic growth imports rose at a 106 percent rate in the fourth quarter while exports grew by a 69 percent rate for the year imports shot up 118 percent and exports rose 35 percent
the trade deficit subtracted 111 percentage points from growth in 1999 a slight improvement from the 118 percentage-point reduction recorded in 1998 the us trade deficit is the one blot on an otherwise vibrant economy
even though overseas' demand for us products is picking up us manufacturers continue to feel the lingering effects of the global financial crisis that struck in 1997 and severely depressed foreign demand for us goods
a snapshot of the commerce department's gross domestic product - the total output of goods and services - through the years all the figures are percent changes from the previous year a negative number indicates the economy contracted
the dow jones industrial average is down 40 points in today's early going losing issues on the new york stock exchange hold a 3-2 lead over gainers
the nasdaq composite index is off 29 points and the standard &amp poor's 500 stock index is down four points
investors are once again showing nervousness about higher interest rates the latest economic indicators show a fast-moving economy with inflation picking up at a faster rate than economists had foreseen
the news sent bond market interest rates higher and that's putting pressure on stocks from the outset
even before the reports were released many analysts were predicting the federal reserve would raise short-term interest rates when it meets next week
the family of a 30-year-old massachusetts woman whose death was blamed on the fen-phen diet drug combination settled a lawsuit against drug maker american home products the company announced thursday
terms of the deal with relatives of mary j linnen were kept secret but the company said much of it will be used to fund a research foundation established by the family to aid in treating the rare lung disease that killed her primary pulmonary hypertension
the wall street journal on friday cited unidentified sources saying the company settled the case for about $10 million american home refused to confirm or deny the report
linnen of quincy mass had taken the diet drug combination for 24 days in 1996 in an attempt to lose weight for her wedding she was diagnosed with the debilitating disease that november and died the following february after suffering partial blindness the state court suit said
linnen's parents thomas f and mary j linnen of palm coast fla said in the suit that an autopsy determined their daughter died as a result of pulmonary hypertension associated with the fen-phen therapy
after her diagnosis she lived each day feeling and believing that she had been given a death sentence the suit said
a statement by the company thursday did not address the issue of whether or not american home products admitted any wrongdoing and wyeth spokesman doug petkus refused to comment on the issue
american home products' wyeth-ayerst laboratories division marketed the fen in the drug combination fenfluramine which was paired with phentermine to make fen-phen wyeth-ayerst also made a related diet drug dexfenfluramine which went under the brand name redux
almost six million americans took the drugs until they were banned by the food and drug administration in 1997 after reports that some users developed serious and sometimes fatal heart problems phentermine is still on the market
in october 1999 american home products agreed to pay $375 billion to settle thousands of lawsuits filed nationwide by people claiming health problems due to fen-phen but the settlement only applied to patients with possible heart valve problems it did not cover linnen's disease
the company has set aside approximately another $1 billion to deal with other claims that might arise even though the exact terms of the linnen settlement weren't known alex zisson an industry analyst with hambrecht &amp quist said wall street had been given no reason to believe it jeopardized that reserve
they haven't given out a dollar figure but at this point they've said the charge will be adequate zisson said wall street at this point just wants all the fen-phen litigation to go away even if american home has to pay a little more than the cases deserve wall street would say that's a good deal
american home which is fighting with competitor pfizer over american's planned merger with another drug maker warner-lambert saw its shares fall $112 1/2 thursday to $4337 1/2 on the new york stock exchange
the linnens' suit was the first wrongful death case filed against american home products in connection with the fen-phen drugs said their lawyer alex macdonald
it was not the first death case settled
in houston last year relatives of 35-year-old mary marisa smith who claimed fen-phen killed her agreed to settle for an undisclosed amount of money three weeks into trial
settlements of suits in other states and major jury verdicts against american home have recently raised questions about whether enough fen-phen users will accept the national settlement american home can reject the preliminary deal if too many patients opt out of it and pursue their own lawsuits
even at the time fen-phen was being marketed primary pulmonary hypertension was a recognized although rare side effect zisson said the linnens claimed their daughter wasn't notified of the risk
the linnens and american home products settled the suit after it went to trial during the trial the company disputed that its drug could be conclusively linked to her condition
a top wall street executive has pleaded innocent to charges he engaged in insider trading with an x-rated movie star with whom he was allegedly intimately involved
the plea by james mcdermott jr the former chief executive of keefe bruyette &amp woods was entered during a brief proceeding in us district court in manhattan on thursday kathryn gannon known as marylin star in the adult film industry remains a fugitive in the case
a third defendant anthony p pomponio also pleaded innocent thursday mcdermott 48 of briarcliff manor and pomponio 45 of north caldwell nj have already been arrested and freed on bail ms gannon 30 of miami fla is believed to be in canada
the new york investment bank chief was accused of tipping ms gannon about companies on the verge of mergers that would dramatically affect their stock prices ms gannon then allegedly bought the stocks and shared the information with pomponio a friend who also allegedly cashed in
according to court papers mcdermott 48 who is married was intimately involved with ms gannon while the insider trading was going on
neither defendant commented outside court thursday
a federal judge might be sen john mccain's last hope to run in the new york republican presidential primary in most of the state
an albany county judge on thursday threw the arizona senator off the march 7 ballot in eight of the state's congressional districts saying mccain didn't get enough gop signatures to compete in those districts if the decision stands mccain's name will not be on the republican presidential ballot in a fourth of the state's districts
however mccain's lawyers planned today to ask a federal judge in brooklyn to put mccain on the ballot in all 31 of the state's districts
we all know that i'm a qualified candidate mccain told reporters after a town hall meeting at nashua high school in new hampshire
he said he would take the issue to the floor of the republican national convention in philadelphia this summer if the courts fail to satisfy him
in a potential boost to mccain millionaire rival steve forbes decided to intervene today in mccain's federal lawsuit paul sullivan forbes' attorney said forbes has been struck from the ballot in three congressional districts because of technical violations of the state election laws like mccain the forbes campaign believes that bush supporters are behind the move
i think it's a clearly politically motivated attempt to strike us from the ballot with some of the most arcane technicalities in the new york ballot access statutes sullivan said
new york election laws are generally considered the nation's most arcane but cannizzaro disagreed in throwing mccain out of the districts calling the signature requirements reasonable
supreme court justice joseph cannizzaro late thursday overturned the state board of elections' decision to allow mccain to compete in the challenged districts despite challenges from state republicans most of whom support gop front-runner george w bush
in the challenged districts the arizona senator did not have the number of signatures on his presidential petitions to qualify for the state primary however mccain supporters argued that since he was a valid national presidential primary contender the signature requirement should not apply to him
new york election laws are generally considered the nation's most arcane but cannizzaro disagreed calling the signature requirements reasonable
it is not the prerogative of any single candidate to interpose his or her own judgment in place of that of the state legislature in this regard the judge said
gop candidates must get a certain number of signatures from party members to qualify for separate convention delegate slates in each of the state's 31 congressional districts in effect there are 31 separate gop primaries in new york
bush supporters had challenged mccain in 16 of those districts cannizzaro's decision leaves mccain off the ballot in a fourth of the state's districts
jeff buley a state republican committee lawyer working in support of bush cheered the decision we're pleased and think it was the proper decision he said
mccain's campaign lawyer henry berger said they had not yet decided whether to appeal cannizzaro's decision

with polls showing mccain running ahead of bush in new hampshire the battle over the new york primary ballot has become even more important
democrats helped mccain stay on the ballot in those eight districts the two republican members of the state board of elections had voted on wednesday to uphold the challenges to mccain's petitions
but the board's two democrats abstained thus depriving the bush camp of the third vote it needed to have the petitions invalidated for a lack of signatures
there was no clear indication thursday when the ballot for new york's march 7 primary would be final the state board had hoped to complete the ballot by monday
cannizzaro's decision is part of the battle over new york's march 7 presidential primary
developer donald trump won the right to compete for independence party backing and forbes lost his spot on the republican ballot in three long island congressional districts
trump who is not an announced presidential candidate is considering running for the reform party's presidential nomination his new york supporters who operate as the independence party are seeking to run delegate slates for him in the march 7 primary
but a coalition within the independence party has been trying to have trump's delegates thrown off the ballot the democracy coalition supports trump's nemesis and reform presidential candidate pat buchanan
in retaliation for the long island challenge to his petitions forbes is seeking a court order to remove frontrunner george w bush from the gop ballot in six districts in new york city
chase manhattan corp's decision to ask account holders before selling their names to outside marketers may prompt other banks to offer similar privacy protections
if chase can do it that means other banks can do it frank torres legislative counsel for consumers union said about the new settlement agreement between chase and new york state's attorney general
but most big banks aren't ready to do that and states ultimately might compel them to tighten their privacy practices torres said thursday
at the same time financial institutions are concerned about recent privacy enforcement actions against banks by several states as well as an initiative by some states to enact new privacy laws that are stricter than federal requirements congress established in november
the states are fully engaged said john byrne senior counsel for the american bankers association banks around the country are taking stock of their privacy procedures he said some banks will decide on their own to go beyond the mandated procedures if that's what their customers want to see
under the agreement chase must have written consent from account holders before it can sell or share their data with outside marketers
under the settlement accord announced tuesday by attorney general eliot spitzer in albany ny chase agreed to stop providing outside marketers with the credit line and balance information of customers as many as 22 million consumers had been affected chase the nation's third-largest bank holding company has some $370 billion in assets
the case really demonstrates the need for legislation that protects consumers from having their personal sensitive financial information distributed outside of the bank said barry steinhardt associate director of the american civil liberties union i hope other banks follow chase but i'm not optimistic
new york city-based chase agreed not to share any customer data with outside marketers such as telemarketers without customers' express written consent even in cases where customers do give their permission chase agreed to provide only their names addresses and telephone numbers to the marketing firms but not any financial data
this is stricter than the privacy provision in the new federal law which allows banks and other financial institutions to share customers' data with outside firms unless customers expressly ask them not to do so
the financial services industry had opposed even this more lenient requirement it won the right in the legislation for banks securities firms and insurance companies that are affiliated under the same corporate roof to share customers' data customers are unable to stop such sharing by affiliated financial companies
the case involving chase arose from an investigation by spitzer's office into allegations that the bank had provided customer information to marketers in violation of its own privacy policy as disclosed to consumers the data it shared was said to have included encrypted account numbers and loan data
the marketing firms used the information to phone chase customers to try selling them emergency road service plans discount shopping clubs legal services travel clubs garden supplies and magazine subscriptions chase received a commission on successful sales
while it agreed to the settlement chase denied any wrongdoing state officials said they hadn't accused the bank of anything illegal but they promised to pursue similar enforcement actions against other financial companies

at midday on wall street the dow jones industrial average was down 11789 at 1091013 the dow has been grinding back and forth in recent days amid worries about rising rates

before the session began the government released two reports that reinforced expectations that fed officials will intensify their battle against inflation next week by raising interest rates to slow the us economy
the commerce department reported that the economy grew at a sizzling 58 percent annual rate during the final three months of 1999 well above the 51 percent forecast by many analysts and the strongest growth since a 59 percent rate posted in the last three months of 1998
separately the labor department said its employment cost index closely watched by fed chairman alan greenspan rose 11 percent in the fourth quarter well above the 09 percent increase many analysts were expecting employment costs typically account for two-thirds of a product's price
those reports compound other recent signs that the economy continues to chug along despite three increases in lending rates by the fed in less than a year the central bank's policy makers meet again on tuesday but more pivotal to the market than a rate boost which most investors expect by now may be the accompanying statement on the fed's stance going forward
that may determine whether the market can climb back to record levels for now the dow has fallen 6 percent from its jan 14 closing high of 1172298 and the nasdaq sits nearly 5 percent from its closing high of 423540 set just last friday
in other trading today declining issues outnumbered advancers by a 7-to-4 ratio on the new york stock exchange and a slightly smaller margin on the nasdaq stock market the russell 2000 index of smaller companies was down 505 at 51197

on new year's eve someone handed me a party noisemaker that said made in china it was a mundane detail but one that would have been unimaginable in the not-too-distant past
nowadays we running dogs of western imperialism can take package tours to the ming tombs and it seems that everything from ballpoint pens to coffee machines is made in the people's republic of china so welcoming the millennium with chinese-made noisemakers may seem no big deal
but considering that until 1970 americans were forbidden to visit or trade with communist china the story behind this momentous thaw is always worth retelling
nixon's china game an hourlong documentary airing at 9 pm monday is a lively british-made contribution to pbs-tv's the american experience series it's a reminder of how far we have come in the 31 years since richard nixon then the newly elected president set out to change the world in defiance of the foreign policy establishment and members of his own republican party
imagine that world the soviets had just invaded czechoslovakia the vietnam war was still raging and hanoi's soviet allies were being thoroughly unhelpful about ending it they wouldn't even agree to a summit with nixon
mao tse-tung's china meanwhile had joined the nuclear club and was convulsed by mass upheaval called the cultural revolution until nixon came along henry kissinger wrote in his memoirs us policymakers had treated the world's most populous country as a brooding chaotic fanatical and alien realm difficult to comprehend and impossible to sway
moreover it was widely assumed that china and the soviet union both being communist and anti-western must be in cahoots in fact the opposite was becoming evident as the two armies began skirmishing on their border
what the public didn't know was that nixon the old cold warrior was about to upend the chessboard he had concluded that adroit us diplomacy could profit from the worsening soviet-chinese split the united states had boycotted china since the communists seized power in 1949 nixon resolved to end this angry isolation as he put it
a bipolar world would become tri-polar and it would be moscow's turn to sweat
it all seems so obvious now but not so in 1969 some people including kissinger then nixon's national security adviser thought the president had lost his senses according to the pbs documentary
walter stoessel the us ambassador to poland was asked make the first approach to his chinese counterpart he also balked because it was so against orthodoxy and in a sense so dangerous kissinger relates so nixon talked to stoessel asking him to simply approach the chinese ambassador and say hello
easier said than done given the mental chasm dividing the two countries
the first overture almost turned to farce stoessel and his staff tried to get the ambassador's attention at a fashion show in warsaw by chasing after the chinese guests
one embassy staffer jiang zhicheng recalls in the film these americans ran after us shouting in polish we are from the american embassy' the ambassador panted i saw president nixon in washington he wants to establish relations with china'
the message got through but slowly
a delicate diplomatic dance followed until the first major public sign of change came in april 1970 mao invited the us table tennis team to china and the phrase ping-pong diplomacy was coined with pakistani mediation the breakthrough came in july 1971 when kissinger secretly visited china leading the first official us delegation into the alien realm in 22 years
the documentary skillfully laces the story with details that show us the human side of high diplomacy kissinger forgetting to pack a spare shirt and having to borrow an oversized one from an aide a pakistani official entrusted with driving kissinger clandestinely to the airport who mislays his car keys
culminating in nixon's weeklong visit to china in february 1972 the china game ended in an american triumph for which the film gives nixon almost all the credit soon nixon would be engulfed by watergate but the seeds of his gambit would lead to china's momentous shift toward capitalism
today despite frequent clashes over human rights and trade some 700000 americans visit china annually and china has a $57 billion trade surplus with the united states that's a lot of noisemakers

german telecom mannesmann ag plans to join forces with the world's largest bank to launch a new european service that lets people turn their phones into personal bank tellers by combining telephone and bank accounts in the same network
the venture with deutsche bank ag called tele-commerce bank is expected to bolster mannesmann's e-commerce strategy and strengthen its defense against the $156 billion hostile takeover bid by rival british telecom vodafone airtouch plc it also comes during a flurry of rumors that mannesmann was looking to dig in further with another venture with aol europe
this is an additional argument to shareholders to hold on to mannesmann said hermann reith a telecom analyst with bhf bank in frankfurt on friday it shows that mannesmann is also an internet company while vodafone has nothing when it comes to the internet
the 50-50 venture between deutsche bank and mannesmann - which should be up and running later this year - will tap mannesmann's 35 million customers allowing them to access bank accounts either through fixed line or wireless phones it will also combine banking and telephone bills into one monthly statement
mannesmann will provide the wires switches telephones and billing centers deutsche bank will chip in the financial services both partners benefit because of cost efficiencies and low overhead reith said
a brokerage service will be added in 2001
vodafone spokesman barry wick dismissed the development as nothing special and a normal outgrowth of the growing e-commerce sector
press reports friday also speculated that mannesmann was also seeking a stake in aol europe the continent's no 2 internet service provider and a 50-50 venture between german media giant bertelsmann ag and dulles va-based america online inc
the company would not comment on whether it was looking for a one-third stake in aol europe for $74 billion as reported in the german business daily handelsblatt
while such a move would not outright block vodafone's takeover bid it could back up mannesmann's defense that the company is better off going alone with its mixed strategy of wireless fixed line and internet services - as opposed to vodafone's sole reliance on mobile phones
mannesmann spokesman manfred soehnlein said the recent internet expansion is part of the company's long-term strategy not a response to vodafone's takeover bid he added that the company's projections for growth and increased value are better reasons for shareholders to hold on to their stakes instead of selling out to vodafone
mannesmann shareholders have until feb 7 to decide whether to accept vodafone's offer
shares in mannesmann dropped 03 percent to 26820 euros $26283 while deutsche bank was down 083 percent to 7854 euros $7696 vodafone shares fell just 3 cents to $563

the dow industrials at one point were down more than 200 points and the nasdaq composite index fell more than 150 before regaining some lost ground
the dow jones industrial average was down 19986 or by 18 percent at 1082916 in active trading this afternoon broader stock indicators were also posting sizable losses with the nasdaq down 14395 or by 36 percent at 389561
before the session began the government released two reports that reinforced expectations that the fed will intensify its battle against inflation next week by raising interest rates to slow the us economy there also are worries that more increases will follow in the months ahead
rising rates increase the cost of doing business reducing corporate profits higher rates also could slow consumer spending which has been a driving force behind the economy's long expansion
the commerce department on friday reported that the economy grew at a sizzling 58 percent annual rate during the final three months of 1999 well above the 51 percent forecast by many analysts and the strongest growth since a 59 percent rate posted in the last three months of 1998

mercury doesn't just dip here in january it disappears from the thermometer days as cold as an ice box in this adirondack village are a warm relief
how cold is it here
it's so cold that gasoline can turn to jelly in cars it's so cold that home heating pipes and toilet bowls are cracking open it's so cold that people mummify themselves in wool and fur before stepping outside
it's hard to breathe said heather tuttle a supervisor at the wawbeek hotel
that's really cold
saranac lake is a quaint village of about 5000 people tucked in the high peaks of the adirondacks not as celebrated or upscale as nearby lake placid the northern new york village still features a rustic charm accented by clapboard homes an old fashioned main street and a mountain lake
and being so high up temperatures far below zero are common temperatures dipped to the -20 to -30 range recently - or -60 with the wind chill even with cloud cover over the past few days temperatures have been as low as -15
it's getting to be so if its zero you feel warm and if it's 8 above you take off your jacket and leave it in the truck said bill decker owner of big d fuel
and when the temperatures nosedive the locals just deal with it
craig catalano manager of asplin tree farm had to go out friday to cut down two balsam fir trees to be shipped to glens falls how does he psyche himself to go out in the cold
he doesn't he just puts on a lot of wool and does it
hopefully it will be quick and simple he said
catalano noted a big problem with the cold was getting the diesel tractors to start up even with electric heaters on the engine blocks fuel will sometimes coagulate in the line he said
andreas mowka said he routinely will plug in his family's three cars overnight but when it gets really cold - as it has a few times recently - he will get up at 3 am to run the cars for a half hour so they don't freeze up
while the cars are idling he'll make sure the horse's water doesn't ice up and stock his house's wood stove 15 face cords a winter then he goes back to bed
you're in a dreamlike state when you do this he said
people with weekend homes in the area have it tougher decker said that in the 24-hours since one home was checked the heating system sputtered out causing water in every pipe to freeze cracking radiators and toilet bowls
our technicians our boiler repairmen aren't getting a lot of sleep he said
saranac lake is not necessarily colder than other places in the adirondacks but it gets more attention because it is the lone federally maintained weather observation site in the area it's also the largest year-round population center within the 6-million-acre park
it sort of becomes representative of the adirondacks said national weather service meteorologist mike cempa
residents here know their hometown has a frosty reputation but they tend to shrug it off as the price for living in such a beautiful setting
mowka said he has lived as far afield as iran germany and long island but that saranac lake is the best and most beautiful
mary la rose a retiree who was looking out the window friday morning to watch chickadees flitting about her bird feeder said it's important to keep in mind the upsides of the area

at least five times in the past two years area police have wrongly filed charges against robert c smith after catching someone who claimed to be him
in at least some of those instances it was smith's good friend who tarnished his good name
attorneys for the real robert smith 20 of syracuse managed to get the charges dismissed but the mistakes resulted in new york suspending smith's license warrants being issued for his arrest and smith having to appear in court on several occasions
the most recent episode occurred last weekend when police arrested five men on felony drug charges after finding them in possession of 11 ounces of crack cocaine
it turned out the person who gave smith's name was jeffrey dowdell jr 21 who has been friends with smith since the attended elementary school together in liverpool
dowdell did not have any identification when he was arrested but provided deputies with smith's correct date of birth and address said john d'eredita spokesman for the onondaga county sheriff's department at the jail however a deputy recognized him as dowdell d'eredita said
the deception earned dowdell an extra charge criminal impersonation a misdemeanor
but it also heaped another helping of embarrassment onto smith a young man who lost his hearing three years ago after contracting meningitis said celestine smith smith's mother
celestine smith said she doubted her son will remain friends with dowdell
he's tired of being dragged through the mud and being in court all the time being deaf is hard enough said mrs smith
they were friends since the time they were 9 years old but he can't be too much of our friend if he's doing this to us she said
smith did not want to talk about the affair
dowdell though maintained that smith was his friend and said he was sorry
i know my man robert i know he's mad at me but he'll get over it that's my man dowdell said in a jailhouse interview with the post-standard of syracuse
celestine smith said dowdell admitted to her this summer that he had pretended to be her son on a previous occasion when he was stopped by police
he said he didn't think robert would get in trouble because he can't hear mrs smith said
dowdell admitted monday that he told police he was smith last fall when they confiscated $1000 from him because he was in a drug-infested neighborhood and had no proof he had legally earned the money
however dowdell said he never got any tickets in smith's name
but syracuse police issued three separate appearance tickets in smith's name to an impersonator said attorney december haab who represented smith
the appearance tickets noted that the suspect had a scar on his face and a tattoo - which the real smith does not have haab said neither does dowdell
warrants were issued in 1999 for smith's arrest for failing to appear in court on a marijuana charge the warrants and charges were dismissed after haab met with prosecutors
suspects occasionally deceive police as to their true identity but are usually caught within hours after they are booked and fingerprinted authorities said
i think it's unusual haab said of smith's predicament i hope it's unusual

mannesmann said it considers closer cooperation with bertelsmann a very interesting idea especially since it would give mannesmann better access to the company's vast storehouse of books videos and music
but company would not comment on whether it was looking for a one-third stake in aol europe for $74 billion as reported in the german business daily handelsblatt

technology stocks also were hurt the nasdaq composite index down 11150 at 392806 after being down as much as 150 while the standard &amp poor's 500 index was lower by 2086 at 137770
with that news this morning buyers just walked away and will wait for the fed said barry berman head trader for robert w baird &amp co the market will be weak looking for direction until everybody knows what the fed is doing
before the session began the government released two reports that reinforced expectations that fed officials will intensify their battle against inflation next week by raising interest rates to slow the us economy
the commerce department reported that the economy grew at a sizzling 58 percent annual rate during the final three months of 1999 well above the 51 percent forecast by many analysts and the strongest growth since a 59 percent rate posted in the last three months of 1998
separately the labor department said its employment cost index closely watched by fed chairman alan greenspan rose 11 percent in the fourth quarter or more than the 09 percent increase many analysts were expecting employment costs typically account for two-thirds of a product's price
those reports compound other recent signs that the economy continues to chug along despite three increases in lending rates by the fed since june the central bank's policy-makers meet again on tuesday and wednesday but more pivotal to the market than the expected rate boost may be the accompanying statement on the fed's stance going forward

the new jersey supreme court on friday refused to consider any claim that alcoholism might justify leniency for a corrupt jersey city judge who solicited sex from female traffic offenders
the court voted unanimously to disbar james f boylan who was convicted in federal court in 1998 of reducing traffic fines for female motorists in exchange for sexual favors
boylan was sentenced to federal prison and his ouster comes as no surprise
however boylan's lawyer albert jeffers had argued to the court that boylan should be able to seek some leniency on the grounds the former judge suffered from severe alcoholism at the time of his misdeeds from 1994 to 1997
further jeffers argued every defendant has a constitutional right to at least present a so-called mitigating factor in his defense before the disciplinary review board an agency of the supreme court that collects facts and makes recommendations in attorney discipline because of this error jeffers said boylan was entitled to a new hearing with the board
the court said no on both points
the justices said alcohol impairment may sometimes be a mitigating factor weighing on the side of leniency but not in boylan's case they said his violations of legal ethics were too severe
we are satisfied that no useful purpose would be served by a remand for a new hearing in this case so deep and profound is the impugnment of the integrity of the legal system that disbarment is the only appropriate penalty the court said
we acknowledge the debilitating effect of the disease of alcoholism but the disease does not here equate with a loss of comprehension competency or will sufficient to mitigate the misconduct charged the court said
boylan who was one of several part-time municipal night court judges in jersey city pleaded guilty to a single count of wire fraud to avoid a trial he was sentenced in may 1998 to 30 months in federal prison and ordered to pay $12500 restitution by a federal judge who described his conduct unspeakable
boylan admitted coaching women to lie when they appeared before him so he could give them a reduced fine one of the women he had solicited tipped off the fbi
the women were young and poor and owed hundreds and thousands of dollars in traffic tickets prosecutors said estimating at least 50 women were approached by boylan over the three-year period they said he initiated the sex deals promising to reduce fines if they agreed to meet him later
authorities have declined to say how many women consented to sex with boylan the unspecified sex acts took place at hotels or sometimes in a car according to the fbi
aside for legal and judicial work boylan taught social studies at dickinson high school in jersey city
the union representing the boeing co's engineers and technical workers is planning a walkout and strike next thursday if the latest contract offer from boeing is rejected
a company memorandum circulating among engineers and technical workers indicates that boeing officials plan to postpone two meetings with airline customers of the 747 jetliner in early february because of the high probability of a strike boeing said
we do remain hopeful that the contract will pass but we do take any strike threats from the union seriously said boeing spokesman peter conte
the society of professional engineering employees in aerospace is planning to vote on the contract wednesday
union negotiators originally considered a one-week walkout but decided to call a strike of undetermined length if the contract is rejected speea executive director charles bofferding said
basically the company has shown no desire to negotiate with us and our people have decided to do something about it bofferding said a no vote on this contract is a vote to strike
the union represents nearly 23000 employees about 11 percent of boeing's overall work force including overtime-exempt engineers and scientists in one unit and computer programmers manual writers and other technicians in a second unit about 60 percent of those covered by the contracts belong to the union
key issues include a lack of guaranteed pay increases or bonuses and changes in life insurance and other benefits
both units voted down an earlier contract offer by more than 98 percent in december bofferding said the latest offer was better than the first but did little to alter the status quo
in a letter to a top jewish leader hillary rodham clinton on friday came out against joerg haider and his far-right freedom party becoming part of a coalition government in austria
the move served to call attention once again to the fact that her expected republican senate opponent new york city mayor rudolph giuliani had shared the dais with haider at a martin luther king day event earlier this month
giuliani aides had said at the time that the mayor had not been aware that haider was at the event
haider is a controversial figure who once praised adolf hitler's orderly employment practices and later said veterans of hitler's elite waffen ss were decent people of good character
in a letter to edgar bronfman president of the world jewish congress mrs clinton said haider's record of intolerance extremism and anti-semitism should be of concern to all of us
neither he nor his party should be seriously considered as a partner in an austrian government the first lady added
surely the history of the past century tells us the danger of such a move i hope that people of good will in austria and around the world will speak out and express their concern at this important moment mrs clinton wrote i certainly will
there has been an international outcry in recent days in the wake of news that the center-right austrian people's party was talking with the freedom party about forming a governing coalition
the developments have led to criticism from other european countries and from israel
the clinton camp left no doubt that the letter to bronfman was meant to put giuliani on the spot
it's been nearly two weeks since rudy giuliani shared a dais with joerg haider why hasn't he spoken out howard wolfson a spokesman for mrs clinton said why didn't he throw joerg haider out of the room
the giuliani camp declined to comment on mrs clinton's letter
the mayor created an international incident in 1995 when he threw palestinian leader yasser arafat out of a lincoln center concert celebrating the united nations' 50th anniversary
at the time giuliani blamed the palestine liberation organization for the murder of new yorker leon klinghoffer during the hijacking of the achille lauro cruise liner in 1985
when we're having a party and a celebration i would rather not have someone who was implicated in the murders of americans there giuliani had said
the clinton campaign's move also seemed designed to score points with the state's politically important jewish community the first lady and the mayor have been jockeying over that for months
giuliani had blasted mrs clinton for her embrace of arafat's wife last year just moments after she had charged that israel was using poison gas against palestinians the first lady later condemned mrs arafat's statements
the mayor's camp was also critical of mrs clinton's appearance at a martin luther king day event this month hosted by al sharpton during the event a sharpton ally had made remarks considered anti-semitic neither mrs clinton nor sharpton were in the room at the time the first lady subsequently criticized the comments
the us economy propelled by hardy consumer spending finished 1999 on a vibrant note but the growth came at a price a worrisome uptick in wages and benefits that economists fear could trigger inflation
during the final three months of 1999 the economy grew at a breakneck annual rate of 58 percent the biggest growth spurt since the end of 1998 the commerce department said friday
for all of 1999 the nation's gross domestic product its total output of goods and services increased by 4 percent the third year in a row at 4 percent or higher
president clinton boasted about the economy at a white house meeting with mayors this unbelievable recovery marches on clinton said referring to the uninterrupted economic growth since the 1990-1991 recession that will set a record of eight years and ten months next week
at the same time another government report showed friday that employees' wages and benefits surged 11 percent in the fourth quarter rekindling worries about inflation and higher interest rates
amid these worries stocks tumbled the dow jones industrial average was down more than 140 points the nasdaq more than 100 points in late afternoon trading but the bond market staged a stunning turnaround as jittery investors shifted their money away from stocks
the rising tide of economic growth has stirred up inflation in its wake said richard yamarone an economist with argus research corp
with the roaring economy driving down the nation's unemployment rate to its lowest point in 30 years employers are having trouble finding scarce workers to fill openings some employers are wooing workers with higher wages and benefits that's good for workers but economists fear those increased costs could lead to inflation
the 11 percent spike in the labor department's employment cost index considered the best measure of changes in wages and benefit costs and closely watched by federal reserve chairman alan greenspan stemmed from a 13 percent jump in benefits the biggest increase in six years economists blamed rising health care costs for the big increase in benefit costs
both reports contain the smoking gun that the fed has been worried about - wage pressures are surfacing and inflation is on the uptick said first union economist david orr
the federal reserve meets next week to decide interest rate policy and most economists expect the fed to boost rates by a quarter of a percentage point to slow the red-hot economy and keep inflation from escalating
a few economists said friday's reports may put pressure on the fed to bump up rates by a half a point on feb 2 but more economists said the reports raise the odds that the fed will follow up next week's expected increase with a quarter-of-a-point rate boost on march 21
despite the fed's three rate increases last year the economy continues to grow at a rapid pace that some economists fear cannot be sustained without triggering inflation
an inflation gauge tied to gdp rose 15 percent in 1999 a worse showing on inflation than the 07 percent increase recorded the year before
the best of inflation news is clearly behind us and if we keep growth at a 4 percent pace as we did in all of 1999 then the price problems will almost certainly worsen said economist joel naroff of naroff economic advisors
consumer spending which accounts for two-thirds of the country's economic activity drove 1999's growth rising 53 percent for the year plentiful jobs rising wages and benefits and stock market gains have made americans feel wealthy and put them in the mood to spend
all that spending pushed the nation's savings rate - savings as a percentage of disposable income - to an all-time annual low of 24 percent last year in 1998 the savings rate was 37 percent
that isn't as dire as it seems however because the savings rate doesn't take into account gains households have realized on their savings from such factors as rising stock market values and higher real estate values for their homes
business investment - spending on new equipment and plants - increased 83 percent last year down from 127 percent in 1998 rising mortgage rates dampened housing construction which rose 72 percent in 1999 but wasn't as brisk as the 92 percent increase the year before
the us trade deficit continued to be a drag on the economy subtracting 111 percentage points from growth in 1999 but that was a slight improvement from the 118 percentage-point reduction recorded in 1998
imports shot up 118 percent last year slightly more than the 116 percent increase posted in 1998 exports rose 35 percent last year compared with a 22 percent rise the year before

president clinton today sought common ground with republicans on an effort to save social security - while urging the nation's mayors to keep pressure on capitol hill to ensure it gets done this year we do not want to miss this moment he said
during a white house breakfast with dozens of mayors in town for the us conference of mayors annual winter meeting the president said some issues he laid out in his state of the union address thursday night such as preserving social security and medicare are too pressing to be stalled by election-year politics but he said he fears lawmakers might put politics ahead of those concerns if they feel little or no pressure from the local level
it doesn't matter whether you're a republican or democrat we are going to double the number of people over 65 clinton said the further away you move from the grass roots the more likely politics is to shift from deeds to words so you mayors can make a difference here
later clinton traveled to quincy ill to spell out his state of the union proposals for the denizens of the midwest and repeat his call for action on education social security paying down the debt and helping those who have yet to join in the recent economic prosperity
we can bring free enterprise and hope to people who have never had it he said
in a nod to the farmland that surrounds quincy clinton also called anew for overhaul of federal assistance to farmers
we've got to understand that we're a strong country when we all work together and we give everyone a chance to rise he said
clinton also sought the mayors' help in building support for his proposal to repair dilapidated public schools to ease concerns among lawmakers about federal intervention in an entirely local issue
thursday night house speaker dennis hastert r-ill singled out health care education debt reduction tax cuts and anti-drug aid to colombia as areas of potential agreement with the president i think a lot of it is doable if the president will sit down and work with us hastert said
but following clinton's 89-minute speech to congress the longest of his eight state of the union addresses many of the same old divisions remained republicans said he had proposed far too much new spending and not enough tax reduction which combined with their lingering distrust of him lays the groundwork for a contentious election year
the proof is not him saying it tonight to a national television audience said rep joe barton r-texas the proof is directing his minions to work with the republican congress to actually do it
the president used his address to senators and representatives gathered in the house chamber in part to recount the successes of his first seven years in office a near-record economic expansion federal deficits converted to surpluses lower crime rates
in 1992 we just had a roadmap today we have results he said
he also laid out a wish list for his final year that ranged from sweeping ideas - $350 billion in tax cuts retirement savings accounts more spending for schools and health care photo id licenses for handguns - to narrower ones like encouraging the development of new vaccines and less-polluting cars
tonight is special because we stand on the mountaintop of a new millennium clinton said behind us we see the great expanse of american achievement before us even grander frontiers of possibility
some of his proposals have the potential for bipartisan compromise
he would spend more for teachers head start after-school and summer school programs and provide college tuition tax deductions of up to $2800 per family he wants to use parts of the huge projected federal surpluses to eliminate the $36 trillion publicly held portion of the national debt by 2013
the president's tax package joined a mix of proposals urged by republicans and democrats as both sides battle for control of congress and the white house house republicans are drafting their own version of educational tax breaks and relief from the so-called marriage penalty this year presidential candidates have their own proposals too
clinton would boost funds for scientific research raise military pay increase the $515 hourly minimum wage and create a new medicare prescription drug benefit and he would pare taxes for child care long-term care of ailing relatives charitable giving and companies investing in inner cities and rural areas
for too long this congress has been standing still on some of our most pressing national priorities he said in one of his few overt swipes at the republicans from whom democrats hope to win congressional control in november let's begin with them
but leavening such attacks were other gestures such as when he turned and shook hands with hastert after lauding him for supporting efforts to increase investments in urban areas and many republicans eager to at least appear cooperative in an election year returned the favor
he wants to have a legacy said rep thomas davis r-va chairman of the national republican congressional committee the house gop's campaign arm he has some reasonable proposals here and we want to deal with them it works for us if he does it right we like to show we're doing things too
even house majority whip tom delay r-texas one of clinton's most bitter foes joined many of the frequent rounds of applause and left the door open to accomplishment
everyone knows we have some very serious disagreements over some very important principles delay said but i am hopeful that the president will work with us and leave office with a record of achievement
the politics was also evident in some of the proposals clinton made that have little or no chance of enactment this year those included his calls for campaign finance reform and licensing handgun owners
the american people will throw that right back into his face said sen larry craig r-idaho a member of the national rifle association
clinton renewed his push for new rights for patients of health maintenance organizations he would provide health insurance for millions of low-income parents - a $110 billion 10-year effort - and let people between 55 and 65 buy into the medicare medical insurance program to help them afford that he would provide them with a tax credit
german telecommunications company mannesmann ag plans to join forces with the world's largest bank to launch a new european service that turns phones into personal bank tellers by combining telephone and bank accounts
the venture with deutsche bank ag called tele-commerce bank is expected to bolster mannesmann's e-commerce strategy and strengthen its defense against the $156 billion hostile takeover bid by rival british telecom vodafone airtouch plc at the same time mannesmann confirmed that it is seeking a stake in internet provider aol europe
this is an additional argument to shareholders to hold on to mannesmann said hermann reith a telecom analyst with bhf bank in frankfurt on friday it shows that mannesmann is also an internet company while vodafone has nothing when it comes to the internet
the 50-50 venture between deutsche bank and mannesmann - which should be up and running later this year - will tap mannesmann's 35 million customers allowing them to access bank accounts either through fixed line or wireless phones it will also combine banking and telephone bills into one monthly statement
mannesmann will provide the wires switches telephones and billing centers deutsche bank will chip in the financial services both partners benefit because of cost efficiencies and low overhead reith said
a brokerage service will be added in 2001
vodafone spokesman barry wick dismissed the development as nothing special and a normal outgrowth of the growing e-commerce sector
mannesmann confirmed friday that it was also seeking a stake in aol europe the continent's no 2 internet service provider and a 50-50 venture between german media giant bertelsmann ag and us-based america online
mannesmann said it considers closer cooperation with bertelsmann a very interesting idea especially since it would give mannesmann better access to the company's vast storehouse of books videos and music
but company would not comment on whether it was looking for a one-third stake in aol europe for $74 billion as reported in the german business daily handelsblatt
we've been in talks for some time spokesman manfred soehnlein said at this stage we can't comment on the details
while such a move would not outright block vodafone's takeover bid it could back up mannesmann's defense that the company is better off going alone with its mixed strategy of wireless fixed line and internet services - as opposed to vodafone's sole reliance on mobile phones
mannesmann spokesman manfred soehnlein said the recent internet expansion is part of the company's long-term strategy not a response to vodafone's takeover bid he added that the company's projections for growth and increased value are better reasons for shareholders to hold on to their stakes instead of selling out to vodafone
mannesmann shareholders have until feb 7 to decide whether to accept vodafone's offer
shares in mannesmann dropped 03 percent to 26820 euros $26283 while deutsche bank was down 083 percent to 7854 euros $7696 vodafone shares fell just 3 cents to $563
a federal judge has withdrawn his ruling that anna nicole smith was entitled to half of her late husband's oil fortune
a new ruling is scheduled to be handed down later the houston chronicle reported friday and legal experts said it was unclear what impact the new ruling would have in the case
last may los angeles us bankruptcy judge samuel l bufford said ms smith a former playmate of the year was entitled to an estimated $820 million from the estate of her late husband texas oilman j howard marshall ii
since then there's been a debate about whether bufford has jurisdiction on the matter because a county probate court is scheduled to divide the estate in an upcoming houston trial
on thursday harris county probate judge mike wood told lawyers he believes bufford withdrew his order because he realized he has no jurisdiction wood has said only his court has jurisdiction over claims to marshall's fortune
ms smith went to bufford's court in october her lawyer said fraudulent handling of her husband's estate had left her broke
ms smith was 26 when she married the 89-year-old billionaire in 1994 before he died 14 months later her attorney said he talked to two lawyers about assuring half of his estate would go to his wife
that scenario was called a fantasy by a lawyer for marshall's son e pierce marshall
actress joanne woodward has joined the leadership of the westport country playhouse as the theater tries to move from a summer-stock repertoire toward new works with more eclectic appeal
woodward will head the theater's new artistic advisory council to develop a new strategy for the 70-year-old summer theater
i am thrilled to have an opportunity to work with a collective of artists that will shape the programming future of the playhouse woodward said
the 69-year-old actress who won the best-actress oscar for the 1957 film the three faces of eve and her husband paul newman live in westport they appeared at the theater last year in a production of ar gurney's love letters to benefit a regional land trust
the theater is getting new management following last week's resignation of james b mckenzie who was executive producer of the playhouse for 41 years
bergen county authorities are considering a proposal to build a minor league baseball stadium in a county park near routes 95 and 80
steven kalafer the co-owner of the somerset patriots wants to build a $22 million stadium in overpeck park it would house the bergen cliff hawks an expansion team of the independent atlantic league
the league already has teams in brigdewater newark and atlantic city and has proposed adding new jersey franchises in camden as well as bergen county it also has teams in new hampshire connecticut and pennsylvania
bergen county executive william pat schuber on thursday formed a 15-member task force to consider kalafer's proposal key details still have to be worked out including how much local taxpayers would have to pay for the facility
i want this to be as taxpayer-neutral as possible schuber said friday we have to explore the feasibility of a stadium here and see if we have any access or environmental issues
kalafer said he'd like bergen county to pay for construction of the stadium he said local governments' experiences with building stadiums in trenton somerset and atlantic city has shown they can be built for a predictable cost
we want it to be a public-private partnership that proves acceptable to both sides kalafer said they would be responsible for the baseball park i'd be responsible for the team marketing the team and providing upgrades and amenities for the stadium
the 5000 to 6500-seat stadium would be built on one of two proposed sites in the park which straddles several municipalities the preferred site is on the palisades park-leonia border with an alternate site across the overpeck creek in ridgefield park
schuber said he likes what he's seen of the proposal so far
bergen county is the biggest county in the state he said it's a natural market and there's always been great support for baseball here people are not going to abandon the yankees or mets for minor league baseball but this is an affordable alternative
i see families with kids interacting with the players which you never see in the major leagues he said it's like taking baseball back where it should be i like the idea of that
kalafer said bergen county is one of the most fertile potential locations for minor league baseball in the country
given its population demographics and income bergen county is an absolutely natural area to support a baseball team he said
schuber said the task force will hold 12 public hearings on the proposal over the next three months
any plan must be approved by the county freeholder board some of whose members expressed skepticism freeholder james sheehan called the idea dumb and freeholder dennis mcnerney questioned whether it would be appropriate to spend county money on such a project
the atlantic league is not affiliated with major league baseball and therefore is not subject to territorial restrictions that keep affiliated clubs out of the geographic areas near major league teams
the league will enter its third season this spring and also has teams in bridgeport conn easton pa and nashua nh expansion franchises are also planned for plainview ny and aberdeen md
kalafer said he already has obtained permission from the atlantic league to own two franchises provided the business operations of each are kept separate
new jersey also has minor league teams in trenton little falls and augusta
novelist john irving says there's something positive in knowing what your limitations are
he learned that both as a wrestler and a writer
it was kind of a blow to me to discover early on in my wrestling career that despite my technical superiority and my excellent condition somebody who was not my equal in those capacities but just was a marvelous athlete would get the better of me in certain situations irving told the associated press
irving who wrote the world according to garp and the screenplay for his novel the cider house rules also said he learned early on that his dyslexia made him make more mistakes than other students and that every assignment would take him twice the time it took them
but in the long run it helped him as a writer because he accepted that everything you do you have to do again and your capacity for rewriting is the only thing that separates you from people who do things in a hurry
the pentagon is hoping hollywood star power can put a shine on its recruiting pitch
defense secretary william cohen said friday that he and his wife janet have approached about a dozen movie stars film producers and other celebrities to do public service announcements promoting the military on radio and television
we're looking for every which way we can to reach out and touch those young people we need to come into the military cohen said in an interview in his pentagon office
the celebrity pitch is one way
among those the cohens have approached recently movie stars harrison ford and julia roberts as well as tom cruise who starred in the 1986 movie top gun about a navy f-14 pilot movie producer steven spielberg who is working on a tv drama series about the marine corps and actor james brolin who plays marine corps lt col bill kelly on the syndicated tv series pensacola wings of gold
most expressed an interest in doing public service announcements for the military cohen said but none has given a firm commitment he said he hoped to begin the ads this year
the defense department has long cast celebrities in the role of morale boosters for troops stationed abroad but cohen believes hollywood also can help military recruiters reach young people who might not otherwise consider joining the military
recruiting has been a struggle for the military in recent years in part because the booming economy gives young people more alternatives the military is trying to find new avenues to approach potential recruits cohen's idea of using celebrities to pitch the advantages of a military career is one such approach
cohen also sees an expanded role for celebrities in the pentagon's campaign to retain more troops already in uniform in december he took a group of celebrities including former national football league stars terry bradshaw and mike singletary model christie brinkley and mtv's downtown julie brown to kosovo and bosnia to meet with us troops on peacekeeping duty
cohen said he has talked to fox tv about the possibility of broadcasting an nfl pre-game show next season from aboard a navy aircraft carrier
somewhere dionne warwick is wondering why she didn't think of this
new york welfare recipients are now getting jobs with the psychic network a telephone pay service which offers clairvoyance at $499 a minute the company teaches the welfare clients to read tarot cards and offer a peek into the future for callers the city human resources administration confirmed friday
this raises some obvious questions and punch lines best left to late-night television monologues but hra spokeswoman ruth reinecke said the jobs while odd-sounding are actually not strange at all
the pay is rather good and it's attractive to work out of the home for the mothers who have young children she said
the qualifications are a high school diploma and the ability to read write and speak english the pay starts at $10 an hour plus bonuses
fifteen people were hired by the network since april under the city's effort to move people from welfare to work - although it's not clear if mayor rudolph giuliani foresaw this development when he started the program in 1995
the city refused to provide any information about the psychic network citing a confidentiality agreement with companies that participate in the workfare program
the hra offices received a large number of calls about the plan after the new york times first reported the psychic connection a pittsburgh radio reporter trying to track down an hra spokeswoman said the report was the subject of great mirth in the steel city
a woman in the hra offices friday was laughing when she answered another reporter's call is this about the psychics she intuitively inquired
while the 900-number services are a quirky business they are legitimate their ads must run with a required disclaimer that the calls are strictly for entertainment value
trying to track down the owner of the psychic network could require the use of tea leaves the only phone listing under the name is a florida bookstore that has no connection to the telephone business
in new york there was no listing for the psychic network attempts to reach the company telepathically were also unsuccessful
the psychic phone lines often advertised on late-night television or via informercials haven't drawn this much attention since the psychic friends network filed for chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in february 1998

lockheed martin corp slashed its dividend in half friday continuing a belt-tightening that already includes plans for 2800 new job cuts in an attempt to reverse setbacks at its aerospace and aviation businesses
the nation's second-largest defense business after boeing co also reported fourth-quarter earnings after excluding one-time gains fell 20 percent from a year earlier matching wall street's diminished expectations
lockheed officials reiterated a warning first made in october year that the bleak financial picture would continue into the new year but projected gains in the years to come
we have a very strong conviction that the year 2000 will be the low point for earnings and cash generation for this corporation chief financial officer robert j stevens told analysts in a telephone conference call friday
lockheed stock which fell 3 percent on thursday was off an additional 16 percent in afternoon trading friday on the new york stock exchange dropping 31 1/4 cents to $1912 1/2 a share
cutting quarterly dividend payments from 22 cents a share to 11 cents effective with the payout due march 31 is the latest in a series of measures aimed at improving the bottom line reducing the dividend frees up about $180 million analysts said
consistent with our previously announced focus on reducing debt it is prudent to change the dividend at this time said vance coffman the chairman and chief executive of the bethesda md-based maker of rockets satellites and the f-16 fighter jet
on thursday the company announced it was eliminating 2 percent of its 140000 jobs worldwide lockheed said the new cuts of 2800 jobs in its aircraft and rockets businesses would produce $200 million in annual savings the latest retrenchment brings the total number of jobs eliminated in recent months to 4500
the purpose of these actions is to drive down indirect and administrative costs to improve earnings and cash flow and reduce debt while improving focus on these businesses coffman said friday
lockheed said it was considering whether to add another subsidiary lockheed martin ims to the list of eight company businesses on the auction block the teaneck nj-based unit which had sales of $500 million last year provides services to government including child-support collection and ticketing drivers caught on red-light cameras
company officials also said they planned to close a deal to acquire bethesda-based comsat corp in the first six months of 2000 lockheed bought 49 percent of the satellite service provider last year but cannot purchase the rest until congress changes comsat's ownership rules to allow it the house and senate are expected to begin working out final legislation next month
analysts gave mixed reviews
all the bad news is out we think the stock is in the midst of a turnaround said jeff pittsburg of pittsburg institutional inc who is advising his clients to buy the stock i think the dividends the layoffs they're trying to create the cash flow they're telling you they're going to generate a lot of cash and that's very important
paul nisbet of jsa research inc has a hold on the stock which he says is in limbo
the prospects as they have outlined them to us certainly aren't very bright he said it doesn't exactly exude confidence
for the fourth quarter of 1999 lockheed reported earnings of $293 million or 76 cents a share compared with $125 million or 33 cents a share in the same 1998 period
profit in the latest quarter included $102 million or 17 cents a share in one-time gains from the sale of surplus real estate noncore businesses and the company's stock in l3 communication holdings the earnings of 59 cents after eliminating the unusual gains met the average estimate of analysts surveyed by first call/thomson financial
for the year lockheed earned $382 million or 99 cents a share compared with $1 billion or $263 a share in 1998 excluding one-time charges earnings for 1999 would have been $150 vs $299 for the previous year
in october the company cut its earnings forecast for 2000 by more than half to about $1 per share and lockheed saw its stock lose nearly half its value
but the company also said it expected earnings per share to grow at an annual rate of 15 percent to 25 percent in the near term with growth at the lower end of the range in 2001
lockheed's problems have been aggravated by troubles in its space systems business there have been several rocket launch failures as well as satellite delays and the loss of satellite contracts such as a long-held us spy satellite contract reportedly worth $45 billion
sales of the company's flagship aircraft the f-16 fighter jet have dwindled lockheed delivered 109 of the planes in 1998 down from 150 in the previous year the company now is almost entirely dependent on foreign sales
wheat prices skidded lower friday on the chicago board of trade after snowy weather struck the southern plains states and much of the nation's winter wheat crop other grains and soybeans also fell
wheat was pressured by the significant precipitation recorded in much of the us wheat-growing region the day before which somewhat alleviated concerns about crop dryness a decline in corn and soybean prices added to the selling mood
corn poked higher early in the session on stronger-than-expected weekly export sales as reported by the us department of agriculture but the overall slump in agricultural commodities and a yen for profit-taking pushed it back under by day's end
soybeans lost ground after usda figures showed us export sales had dropped 72 percent from the previous week adding to the pressure were forecasts for wetter slightly more beneficial crop weather in key growing regions of brazil and argentina over the next 10 days
wheat for march delivery fell 3 3/4 cents to $259 3/4 a bushel march corn fell 2 1/4 cents to $223 1/2 a bushel march oats fell 1/2 cent to $113 1/2 a bushel march soybeans fell 3 1/2 cents to $523 1/2 a bushel
beef and pork futures rose in trading on the chicago mercantile exchange
february live cattle rose 20 cent to 6972 cents a pound march feeder cattle rose 02 cent to 8477 cents a pound february lean hogs rose 90 cent to 57 cents a pound february pork bellies rose 90 cent to 8730 cents a pound
it was art vs money - and the art survived albeit at a hefty price
an old master painting that helped topple a florida savings-and-loan was auctioned at sotheby's on friday
peter paul rubens' portrait of a man as mars sold for $82 million attached to a turbulent past it had been purchased with the federally insured deposits of the mismanaged miami thrift for its high-living chairman who is now behind bars
it is the most important rubens to come on the auction market in the last generation says sotheby's spokesman mathew weigman
in 1989 florida banking officials discovered that the 17th century portrait and two dozen other artworks - a $29 million collection - were purchased with funds from the strapped centrust savings and loan the buyer was david l paul the s&ampl's art-collecting chairman and chief executive
he had paid $132 million for the rubens with sotheby's acting as agent for rush kress widow of samuel kress founder of the five-and-dime store according to the wall street journal sotheby's would not confirm the figure saying this was a private sale
but it also was a high-profile sale and it helped destroy the thrift ceo
paul was in the spotlight he had bought art for the s&ampl without first seeking special permission and the collection was the lesser expense paul had charged up about $45 million in personal expenses with centrust money
in 1990 after centrust stopped paying dividends it was taken over by the federal government in one of the biggest american savings and loan failures the thrift was liquidated and sold to great western bank in beverly hills calif
and in 1994 paul was convicted in miami of fraud conspiracy and racketeering he is serving an 11-year sentence in a federal prison in south carolina
the sale of the paintings was ordered by the florida department of banking and finance
on friday a buyer whose name the auction house did not release paid $82 million for the rubens - a record for this artist at auction that topped a previous one of about $6 million paid for his samson and delilah in 1980 at a london auction according to sotheby's
portrait of a man as mars the image of a man dressed as the god mars is as complex as its recent history
it's an intimate picture - a one-on-one with this guy who's ready to speak to you says christopher apostle a sotheby's senior vice president it's painted with such gusto muscularity this is a god of war yet there's a benign look on his face full of paradoxes
president clinton took the agenda for his final year in office to small town america on friday saying strong economic times demand action on social security education inequality and other long-term challenges
the president asked the residents of quincy to remember how they banded together in 1993 when flood waters imperiled neighboring communities along the mississipppi river - and how their forefathers harbored slaves seeking freedom
when you have the chance of a lifetime to do good you cannot be lulled into complaceny clinton said his overcoat collar turned up against the frigid weather as he spoke in washington park site of the sixth lincoln-douglas debate the president urged an enthusiastic crowd of several thousand people to seize the challenge of a new era
we've got to understand that we're a strong country when we all work together and we give everyone a chance to rise he said
with republicans in control of congress and the november elections beginning to steal the political spotlight the prognosis for clinton's agenda is not rosy but at a white house breakfast with dozens of mayors earlier friday the president said saving the retirement system and improving schools are too important to be stymied by election-year politics
the further away you move from the grass roots the more likely politics is to shift from deeds to words he said asking the local leaders to join his cause you mayors can make a difference here
this town of 42202 named for john quincy adams - who served 17 years in congress after leaving the white house - welcomed clinton warmly the day after he delivered his last state of the union address
hundreds were on hand at baldwin field when the presidential plane arrived local television lingered on every handshake and positioned cameras along the motorcade route to broadcast his arrival live
twenty local heroes from law enforcement officers to teachers and businessmen were seated on the platform as clinton spoke in washington park
quincy is home to farmers and manufacturers a century ago it provided safe haven to escaped slaves who made it across the mississippi river and victims of religious persecution in 1993 the community served as a staging area for relief efforts when flooding overwhelmed nearby towns
clinton chose to visit quincy aides said because it symbolized communities large and small across the country that have prospered during his administration crime and unemployment have reached historic lows over the past seven years
across the politically important state of illinois unemployment has declined 3 percent since clinton took office in 1993 more than 35000 children have entered the head start program and crime is down 9 percent
the president repeated his call for investing more in education - from head start to college tuition assistance shoring up social security while paying down the $36 trillion public debt and spurring investment in areas that have yet to share in the recent economic prosperity
we can bring free enterprise and hope to people who have never had it he said
in a nod to the farmland surrounding quincy clinton also called anew for overhaul of federal assistance to farmers
we should be using this time wisely to deal with the long-term challenges clinton said that's what i want the american people to support
bishop john spong an outspoken supporter of the ordination of gays and women and blessings of same-sex unions in the episcopal church retired friday as head of the diocese of newark
spong 68 celebrated one of his final services as bishop at the glenpointe marriott ballroom before hundreds of guests
his successor john croneberger will take over the position on saturday
since his elevation to bishop in 1976 spong has raised eyebrows and blood pressures for his beliefs ranging from women becoming priests to supporting same-sex marriages to the ordination of openly gay ministers
but spong a native of charlotte nc who speaks with the slightest accent left the diocese with few words of controversy
it's just the next stage of my life said spong in an interview on thursday
basically i've been a bishop but also an author and lecturer he said but in all of my ordained life it was participating in movements of people who've been diminished in society like people of color and gays that the church has diminished where i've worked
among those present at friday's 126th annual convention of the diocese of newark were the rev richard holloway of edinburgh scotland dozens of priests and spong's second wife christine
when i married jack i knew what was ahead said christine who married spong in 1990 when you speak up for gays you're going to get hit you cannot know gay and lesbian people without wanting to hug them some of them have been thrown out of their homes i can't imagine throwing my child out of the house
the sermon given by holloway was the story of the priest and the good samaritan who came across a man who had been robbed and beaten on the road in the story the priest afraid of being deemed unclean passes by but the samaritan stopped to care for the unknown man
the point of the parody is that good religion following traditions in these developed systems can now get in the way of us getting to god said holloway all of us are walking on the road to jericho and we must look for him because he is always ahead and god can be found along the side of the road
the rev cathy deats 50 a married priest and mother stood next to spong as a sign language interpreter
he will be sorely missed said deats who was first ordained as a deacon by spong three years ago i may not agree with everything he says but i truly admire and respect him for standing up for what he believes in
deats said she believed in more traditional routines of prayer
it can be boring i know and i'm not saying the bishop doesn't pray but i believe more strongly in the mystical practices of prayer in the church said deats
croneberger was rector of the church of the atonement in tenafly for 18 years and a priest for more than 34 years
croneberger 60 was one of six candidates - all of whom favor ordaining noncelibate gays and blessing same-sex unions - in a field that included the rev canon gene robinson of new hampshire who missed becoming the first openly gay episcopal bishop in the nation by several votes
as for spong he will lecture at harvard university starting next month but has no plans to move from morris county his latest book here i stand was published this year
spong father of three daughters said he found talking to students a great pleasure
last week spong lectured at lewis &amp clark university in portland ore
i love the minds of 18- to 23-year-olds spong said nothing is sacred and they asked all kinds of questions
there were no questions asked here during the service but there was a moment of fear when the rev dana rose slipped off the back of the riser as spong and others were blessing bread and wine rose was helped to his feet and spong quickly gave him the sign of the cross
rose a gay priest who's also black was ordained first as a deacon by spong in may 1998
people say you're a priest and you're gay said rose who works for the gay and lesbian ministry in the diocese now there are many priests who are gay but black i believe in inclusion of all people like me into the church just like the bishop
coca-cola's targets for earnings growth may have to be lowered slightly but the president of the world's largest soft-drink maker also told wall street on friday that he is optimistic about prospects for the company
douglas daft who has been designated to become chairman and chief executive of atlanta-based coke and two top lieutenants outlined their vision for the company during a nearly two-hour presentation to securities analysts in new york
the meeting came just two days after coca-cola announced plans to eliminate 6000 jobs or one-fifth of the worldwide work force the sweeping reorganization also will give local managers more authority over how best to sell soft drinks
we have put our business much closer to where the business actually takes place daft said friday
coca-cola had an especially tough year in 1999 it recalled soft drinks in several european countries after a health scare its bid for the french soft drink brand orangina was blocked it was forced to scale back plans to buy several cadbury schweppes brands overseas and its sales in asia and latin america suffered because of regional economic turmoil
coke also faces a suit in which several former employees claimed they were denied promotions because of racial discrimination
douglas ivester unexpectedly announced in december that he would step down in april after about 2 1/2 years as chairman and chief executive daft was designated to succeed him in those posts and was named president in the interim
daft said the company is reviewing whether it needs to change its annual growth targets of 15 percent to 20 percent in earnings per share in the wake of this week's restructuring and has not yet completed the analysis
but he told the analysts on friday that the 17 percent to 18 percent average implied by the current estimated growth range is a tad high
he said the new average if there is one won't be below the mid-teens
marc cohen beverage analyst for goldman sachs &amp co said daft's comments may have allayed concerns that it will move down more
but in afternoon trading on the new york stock exchange coca-cola shares were off an additional $225 a share to $5725 it has fallen more than 13 percent from its closing level of $6587 1/2 a share on tuesday the day before the restructuring announcement
daft also said he expects 5 percent to 6 percent growth in coca-cola's sales volume of soft-drink concentrate to bottlers slightly below the target of 7 percent to 8 percent growth
that in part reflects the company's decision to reduce the soft-drink inventories held by its independent bottlers to free money that they can use to improve operations
the inventory reduction will mean coca-cola will sell less concentrate to its bottlers this year
we have a vested interest in having our bottlers be successful said james chestnut an executive vice president whose responsibilities include finance
daft said he didn't want to estimate what volume growth would be beyond the year 2000
but at another point in a question-and-answer session he told the analysts i'm very optimistic about the growth rates
emanuel goldman who follows coca-cola for merrill lynch said he was encouraged by the presentation about the daft team's candor in discussing its plans
they have a great sense of the business they will be disciplined and flexible they will be thoughtful but they won't be shy he said
international specialty products inc is launching a hostile takeover bid for dexter corp the nation's oldest publicly traded company after a previous bid worth nearly $1 billion was spurned
isp said friday it plans to nominate 10 board members who are committed to considering and pursuing isp's offer or a superior proposal when dexter has its annual meeting in april
dexter a specialty chemicals company last month rejected a $45-per-share offer from isp which is headed by wealthy investor samuel j heyman the dexter board called the isp proposal too low
heyman said in a letter to dexter officials that once he had control of the board he intended to allow isp's $932 million offer to be considered directly by dexter shareholders
the windsor locks-based dexter said it was reviewing heyman's letter and would respond in due course
isp of wayne nj also said it filed a federal lawsuit in connecticut on thursday seeking to overturn dexter's poison pill takeover defense that makes it harder for a bid to succeed and validate its proposed board vote
founded in 1767 as a cloth mill dexter was one of the nation's first conglomerates by the 1830s it makes products for the aerospace electronics food packaging and medical markets it is the oldest company publicly traded on the new york stock exchange
heyman who owns 75 percent of isp and about 10 percent of dexter has been critical of dexter's takeover of life technologies inc of rockville md
dexter holds 71 percent of life technologies heyman owns most of the rest of the company he has said he believes dexter and life technologies would be better off apart
isp makes chemicals mineral products and filters life technologies makes supplies for biological research and genetic engineering
in his letter to dexter chairman k grahame walker heyman said the 10 percent decline in dexter's stock price since it rejected isp's offer shows dexter's own shareholders appear to have rejected its business strategy as well
under heyman's proposal dexter shareholders would replace the three current board members up for re-election in april and add seven others enlarging the board to 17
on friday dexter stock was trading on the new york stock exchange at $3787 1/2 down 31 1/4 cents isp stock also traded on the nyse was at $750 down 25 cents
life technologies stock traded over the counter was at $49 per share down 12 1/2 cents

stocks stumbled today amid fresh signs of economic growth so strong that the federal reserve's inflation-fighters are likely to raise interest rates again when they meet next week the nasdaq composite index had its second-biggest point drop ever
the dow jones industrial average fell 28821 or by 26 percent to close at 1073981 in heavy trading according to preliminary figures it was the seventh-biggest point drop ever and left the dow at its lowest level since nov 11
broader stock indicators were also posting sizable losses with the nasdaq down 15129 or by 37 percent at 388827 the only bigger point drop was the 22941-point plunge on jan 4
before the session began the government released two reports that reinforced expectations that the fed will intensify its battle against inflation next week by raising interest rates to slow the us economy there also are worries that more increases will follow in the months ahead
rising rates increase the cost of doing business reducing corporate profits higher rates also could slow consumer spending which has been a driving force behind the economy's long expansion
the commerce department on friday reported that the economy grew at a sizzling 58 percent annual rate during the final three months of 1999 well above the 51 percent forecast by many analysts and the strongest growth since a 59 percent rate posted in the last three months of 1998
separately the labor department said its employment cost index closely watched by fed chairman alan greenspan rose 11 percent in the fourth quarter or faster than the 09 percent increase many analysts were expecting employment costs typically account for two-thirds of a product's price

a judge refused friday to block a revision of the government's dietary guidelines despite complaints that nutrition experts writing it are biased toward the meat and dairy industries
groups representing vegetarians and racial minorities filed suit last month against the clinton administration over the composition of an 11-member advisory committee of nutrition experts doing the revision they contended it should have included at least one representative of people who use federal nutrition programs
us judge district judge james robertson noted during a hearing that the committee's proposed revision was unlikely to include any major changes from the current version he declined to stop the panel from releasing it saying there would be no irreparable injury in doing so
the committee's work which must be approved by the departments of agriculture and health and human services is expected to be made public in the next few weeks the departments are expected to take public comment on the proposed revision for 60 days before deciding whether to approve it
first published in 1980 the guidelines are revised every five years to reflect the latest developments in scientific research the committee's revision will put more emphasis on eating whole grains fruits and vegetables while urging reduced consumption of sweets and saturated fat the guidelines which follow the government's food pyramid will continue to recommend meat and dairy products
federally funded nutrition programs including school lunches and meals on wheels are required to adhere to the recommendations and they are also widely used by professionals and dietitians in advising consumers
the lawsuit filed by the physicians committee for responsible medicine and other groups contends the guidelines emphasize the consumption of meat dairy and egg products and ignore the special dietary needs of minority groups including blacks who are often lactose intolerant at least six of the committee members have ties to the meat and dairy industries through grants or seats on advisory boards the lawsuit says
the government is seeking to have the lawsuit dismissed
the committee members are very accomplished distinguished individuals who are at the top of their fields and include a black and hispanic said meredith manning a justice department lawyer she told the judge that the plaintiffs are essentially trying to get a major change in food policy enacted through the judicial branch when they can't get that enacted through the executive and legislative branches

though supporters' views seemed decidedly mixed bill bradley kept up his aggressive criticism of al gore on friday questioning his democratic rival's truthfulness and portraying him as the kind of politician who uses words in a very tricky manner
you have to look at every word and every clause bradley said in a comment echoing accusations that critics made about president clinton during the lewinsky investigation
some bradley supporters have said his new more confrontational campaign style has made them uncomfortable and one questioned him about it face to face
how can you deal with the sleaze factor without yourself going through the same type of tactic asked sonia sheridan who said she was troubled by the new approach
i think you make a very good point said bradley when someone misrepresents your position as al gore has done consistently in this campaign you call them on it
with polls showing gore with an apparent lead just days before tuesday's new hampshire primary bradley aides said he would continue his new tack
as voters make up their mind this weekend we want to make sure they are aware of the differences said aide anita dunn
sheridan the supporter who questioned bradley wasn't sure how the former senator should respond to gore's criticism
i don't know what he should do so that's why i asked him she said as for negative campaigning she said i certainly don't like that tactic but gore seems to be zooming because of it
other bradley supporters at campaign events friday were less than enthusiastic about his new approach
it makes me uncomfortable said belinda glennie i'd rather see him be the egghead he is
i've heard good reviews and i've heard bad reviews said nick hanlon who attended a rally in newport i hope it doesn't turn people off
unfazed bradley argued at rally after rally that gore makes campaign promises designed to be evasive or to mislead on issues ranging from gun control to health care to abortion rights
for example bradley said gore talks about favoring licensing of handguns but actually favors licensing of new handguns only
the problem is not new handguns the problem is all handguns bradley said
gore said little in response i'm going to emphasize the positive the vice president said as he arrived in portsmouth from his brief return to washington for clinton's state of the union address
i'm not going to get down to that level i'm going to continue to emphasize a positive agenda he said later in an interview with wnds-tv
accompanied by former treasury secretary robert rubin gore stuck to his day's message - that he is the only presidential candidate with the know-how to keep the economy on track
we have just begun to prosper he declared
also on a positive note his campaign previewed for reporters a 30-minute ad it will air on new hampshire television saturday besides commercials that have already been running it includes new scenes - gore playing frisbee with his wife and dancing with his daughter at her wedding - showing him as a loving husband and father
among the people at gore's portsmouth event bradley's recent criticism seemed to have made an impact
at the northern research and engineering corp engineer dave glista a democrat from durham said he was undecided but leaning toward bradley even though his priority issues - the economy and urban sprawl - should put him in gore's camp
everyone says clinton is the king of smooth talking and political talking i'm sure gore has picked up some of that so i would be more leery of what he says glista said
for his part gore accuses bradley of negative campaigning sparked by desperation
undecided democrat amos johnson had her own doubts
i'm more interested in the issues ms johnson said this is a bit abrasive we're going to go see al gore tomorrow and we'll make up our mind
along the way friday bradley collected the endorsement of connecticut gov lowell weicker weicker was a republican senator before winning the governor's office as an independent
one of bradley's strengths is his appeal to independent voters and he was hoping to use weicker's backing to score points with independents on tuesday
weicker aimed his pitch in their direction the only independent thinker and actor out there is bill bradley

stocks staged a sharp decline today as fresh inflation news sparked a wave of sell cries on wall street with banks industrial and technology companies bearing the brunt of the bad news
the dow jones industrial average tumbled 28915 points or by 26 percent to 1073887 led lower by general electric general motors and jp morgan that selling spree brought the week's loss to 51284 points and left the dow at its lowest level since nov 11
an underlying worry of many investors is expectations that the federal reserve will raise interest rates when it meets next week and again later in the year curbing business expansion by making it more expensive to borrow money
the nasdaq composite index suffered its second-biggest point drop ever as investors dumped shares of the usual favorites like qualcomm intel and oracle the broad market indicator the standard &amp poor's 500 also fell
the standard &amp poor's 500 fell 3841 to 136015 and the nasdaq composite index fell 15261 to 388695
declining issues outnumbered advancers by more than 2-to-1 on the new york stock exchange with 2082 down 984 up and 469 unchanged
nyse volume totaled 1076 billion shares as of 4 pm vs 1115 billion in the previous session
the russell 2000 index of smaller companies fell 1240 to 50462
with that news this morning buyers just walked away and will wait for the fed said barry berman head trader for robert w baird &amp co the market will be weak looking for direction until everybody knows what the fed is doing
before the session began the government released two reports that reinforced expectations that fed officials will intensify their battle against inflation next week by raising interest rates to slow the us economy
the commerce department reported that the economy grew at a sizzling 58 percent annual rate during the final three months of 1999 well above the 51 percent forecast by many analysts and the strongest growth since a 59 percent rate posted in the last three months of 1998
separately the labor department said its employment cost index closely watched by fed chairman alan greenspan rose 11 percent in the fourth quarter or more than the 09 percent increase many analysts were expecting employment costs typically account for two-thirds of a product's price
those reports compound other recent signs that the economy continues to chug along despite three increases in lending rates by the fed since june the central bank's policy-makers meet again on tuesday and wednesday but more pivotal to the market than the expected rate boost may be the accompanying statement on the fed's stance going forward
consequently interest-rate sensitive bank stocks took a beating today most notably jp morgan chase manhattan bank and citigroup
industrial companies which are especially vulnerable to economic cycles also saw their shares fall today
phil sokolof the omaha industrialist who successfully pressured the fast food industry to serve healthier meals is now pushing cholesterol-lowering pills
he's paying $25 million for a fourth-quarter advertisement on the super bowl to promote the miracle drugs
in the commercial sokolof says three out of four people with heart disease are not taking enough of the cholesterol-lowering drugs known as statins
about 8 million americans now take statins but health experts say as many as 30 million would benefit arguing that statins reduce cholesterol far better than even the most draconian diet and exercise programs
statins keep arteries from clogging and may even reverse the process studies show people on statins lower their risk of heart attacks by about one-third and they live longer
sokolof 78 who had a heart attack when he was 43 credits statins for helping him stay healthy
this not sokolof's first crusade in the early 1990s sokolof ran newspaper ads exposing hidden sources of saturated fat and he successfully persuaded mcdonald's corp to stop frying its french fries in animal fat
in 1997 he went after the drug industry's profits partially because of the high prices on cholesterol pills
the gouging of america blared the headline on the full-page ads merck how greedy can you get
ironically drug companies such as merck &amp co stand to gain if sokolof's super bowl ad spurs demand for cholesterol drugs merck makes zocor a leading cholesterol-lowering drug
to further spread his message sokolof said he plans to take out full-page ads in major newspapers in the next few weeks
i want to reach as many people as i can and this is the only program more people turn into to watch the ads than the game he said
federal regulators on friday ordered the nation's stock exchanges to begin quoting at least some share prices in dollars and cents by july 3 requiring them to fully abandon the 200-year-old use of fractions by year's end
the new york stock exchange the nasdaq stock market and other us securities exchanges will be required to submit a decimal pricing plan within 45 days and to have decimal prices fully phased in by year's end the securities and exchange commission said in announcing its order
the exchanges have been putting together plans for phasing in decimal prices this year now that the securities industry has cleared the year 2000 technological hurdle
the sec normally refrains from intervening in the markets spokesmen for the securities industry association didn't immediately return a telephone call seeking comment
decimal trading will benefit investors by allowing greater competition and making it easier to compare prices sec chairman arthur levitt said in a statement it will also bring about consistency with foreign markets which now trade in decimals we look forward to working with the industry to ensure that the transition to decimals goes smoothly
as an interim step the nation's two biggest exchanges - the nyse and the all-electronic nasdaq - and some regional exchanges have been quoting stocks in minimum increments of one-sixteenth of a dollar instead of the customary one-eighths in decimals a sixteenth is 625 cents and an eighth is 125 cents
supporters say adopting the decimal system would narrow the difference between a stock's best bid and asking prices known as the spread spreads typically vary from 12 1/2 cents to 50 cents an amount that adds up to a sizable profit for brokers who take in a percentage based on the size of the spread
some stocks will begin trading in nickel increments though many could be trading in penny increments by the end of the year
proponents of the decimalization argue that a narrower spread will increase the competitiveness and efficiency of markets increase trading volume and improve liquidity
by contrast critics have said the narrower spreads in decimal trading would erode profits something that could reduce the number of market makers the firms which form a market's backbone
market makers trade for their own accounts and agree to process customers' orders for particular stocks a sharp drop in market makers could hurt an exchange's ability to handle high-volume trading sessions
hundreds of riot police blocked mexico city streets friday to demand salary raises and other benefits clogging key thoroughfares and causing traffic jams that stretched for miles
before the morning rush hour began uniformed officers parked buses at intersections and erected barricades to block main thoroughfares wreaking havoc for commuters
the officers want 100 percent salary increases better equipment and benefits they also called for the dismissal of their commander the televisa network reported
mexico city mayor rosario robles said the protest was unjustified but acknowledged that an accounting error had delayed paychecks for the officers the government news agency notimex reported she said the problem would be resolved by saturday
protesting officers said they would continue the blockade until city authorities discussed their demands
in the afternoon traffic was congested even further by another street protest by administrative workers from the autonomous university of chapingo the demonstrators who were demanding wage increases walked onto the main freeway that circles mexico city
for two hours the university workers blocked traffic in both directions on the perifico sur riot police who remained on duty during their colleagues' protest were called in to dislodge the workers notimex reported
bishop john spong an outspoken supporter of the ordination of gays and women and blessings of same-sex unions in the episcopal church retired friday as head of the diocese of newark
spong 68 celebrated one of his final services as bishop at the glenpointe marriott ballroom before hundreds of guests
his successor john croneberger will take over the position on saturday
since his elevation to bishop in 1976 spong has raised eyebrows and blood pressures for his beliefs ranging from women becoming priests to supporting same-sex marriages to the ordination of openly gay ministers
but spong a native of charlotte nc who speaks with the slightest accent left the diocese with few words of controversy
it's just the next stage of my life said spong in an interview on thursday
basically i've been a bishop but also an author and lecturer he said but in all of my ordained life it was participating in movements of people who've been diminished in society like people of color and gays that the church has diminished where i've worked
among those present at friday's 126th annual convention of the diocese of newark were the rev richard holloway of edinburgh scotland dozens of priests and spong's second wife christine
when i married jack i knew what was ahead said christine who married spong in 1990 when you speak up for gays you're going to get hit you cannot know gay and lesbian people without wanting to hug them some of them have been thrown out of their homes i can't imagine throwing my child out of the house
the sermon given by holloway was the story of the priest and the good samaritan who came across a man who had been robbed and beaten on the road in the story the priest afraid of being deemed unclean passes by but the samaritan stopped to care for the unknown man
the point of the parable is that good religion following traditions in these developed systems can now get in the way of us getting to god said holloway all of us are walking on the road to jericho and we must look for him because he is always ahead and god can be found along the side of the road
the rev cathy deats 50 a married priest and mother stood next to spong as a sign language interpreter
he will be sorely missed said deats who was first ordained as a deacon by spong three years ago i may not agree with everything he says but i truly admire and respect him for standing up for what he believes in
deats said she believed in more traditional routines of prayer
it can be boring i know and i'm not saying the bishop doesn't pray but i believe more strongly in the mystical practices of prayer in the church said deats
croneberger was rector of the church of the atonement in tenafly for 18 years and a priest for more than 34 years
croneberger 60 was one of six candidates - all of whom favor ordaining noncelibate gays and blessing same-sex unions - in a field that included the rev canon gene robinson of new hampshire who missed becoming the first openly gay episcopal bishop in the nation by several votes
as for spong he will lecture at harvard university starting next month but has no plans to move from morris county his latest book here i stand was published this year
spong father of three daughters said he found talking to students a great pleasure
last week spong lectured at lewis &amp clark university in portland ore
i love the minds of 18- to 23-year-olds spong said nothing is sacred and they asked all kinds of questions
there were no questions asked here during the service but there was a moment of fear when the rev dana rose slipped off the back of the riser as spong and others were blessing bread and wine rose was helped to his feet and spong quickly gave him the sign of the cross
rose a gay priest who's also black was ordained first as a deacon by spong in may 1998
people say you're a priest and you're gay said rose who works for the gay and lesbian ministry in the diocese now there are many priests who are gay but black i believe in inclusion of all people like me into the church just like the bishop
a former french finance minister has been placed under formal investigation for alleged financial wrongdoing in connection with french oil company elf-aquitaine his lawyer said friday
the order by two judges to put former finance minister dominique strauss-kahn under formal investigation means he is one step short of being charged lawyer jean veil confirmed the investigation
the judges eva joly and laurence vichnevsky are looking into accusations of widespread fraud at elf in the early 1990s the oil company confirmed friday that it had lost the equivalent of $35 billion between 1994 and 1998
prosecutors want to investigate allegations that strauss-kahn's personal secretary evelyne duval received one year's salary worth $31500 from the oil company in 1993 duval was not working for strauss-kahn at the time of the alleged payment but at a business group that strauss-kahn had founded
it was another blow for strauss-kahn who is already under investigation for allegedly taking the equivalent of an estimated $100000 for a fictitious job with a student insurance fund the mnef
strauss-kahn who was a powerful figure in prime minister lionel jospin's government resigned in november after the scandal broke
bp amoco extended its deadline friday for acquiring atlantic richfield co apparently trying to give a skeptical federal trade commission more time to review the company's revised merger proposal
the ftc had scheduled a meeting for monday at which the agency had been widely expected to direct its staff to try to block the merger in federal court
but friday the ftc postponed the meeting a short time later bp announced extension to feb 7 of its self-imposed deadline for the merger
the company said in a statement that it agreed to extend the 20-day clock in order to give the federal trade commission time to consider internally whether they believe there is common ground to commence negotiations
ftc officials would not comment on the merger bp amoco spokesman tom koch said the company had no comment beyond the one-paragraph statement
while commissioners still could act on the merger at its meeting now rescheduled for next wednesday bp amoco's decision to extend the 20-day clock suggested efforts were under way to try to avoid a lengthy court fight
bp amoco's chairman sir john browne reportedly made new suggestions to ftc chairman robert pitofsky this week in a last-ditch attempt to keep the agency out of court a short time later the ftc postponed its scheduled meeting
no details of browne's discussion were available friday while it was not clear whether browne's overture was enough to sway the agency bp amoco's friday statement suggested the ftc was considering new offers
bp amoco's purchase of atlantic richfield co or arco as it is commonly known has been in trouble at the ftc for weeks the ftc staff recommended in december against approving the merger because of worries that the combined company would be able to dictate prices in the west coast gasoline market
the two companies control 70 percent of the oil produced on alaska's north slope while bp amoco has agreed to divest some of the alaska petroleum production and make other concessions the new company still would control 55 percent of alaskan oil
the ftc staff has argued that such dominance could hurt competition in the retail gasoline market in california and the northwest where refiners depend heavily on alaskan crude
since jan 14 the ftc staff has shifted from trying to negotiate a settlement to preparing for litigation according to sources familiar with the discussions the commission had been widely expected to approve at a meeting first scheduled for friday then monday and now wednesday a request for an injunction against the merger
neither ftc officials nor bp amoco executives would comment although company officials said thursday that discussions were continuing with the ftc
bp amoco and arco have argued that after the divestitures the new company would pose no competitive problems because west coast prices are dictated by the global oil market and not alaska production
it was only a little over a year ago that british petroleum sealed the purchase of amoco it then announced in april it wanted to buy arco
the deal is among a number of megamergers in the oil industry in late november the ftc approved the combination of exxon and mobil to create the worlds largest privately owned oil company earlier texaco and shell had combined refining and marketing activities
the florida nun selected by attorney gen janet reno as a neutral party in the custody battle over elian gonzalez sought unsuccessfully on friday to persuade reno to change her mind about returning the 6-year-old to cuba sister jeanne o'laughlin also backed legislation to make elian an american citizen
conceding i am no longer neutral o'laughlin told reporters she has come to believe that separating elian now from his florida relatives would be another traumatic loss for him after the death of his mother at sea in november
her abandonment of impartiality was denounced by those seeking elian's return to his father
i am bewildered said rep maxine waters d-calif never in my wildest imagination would i think that a nun who was supposed to be a neutral party would undermine that neutrality
o'laughlin the barry university president whose miami beach home was used earlier in the week for a meeting between elian and his cuban grandmothers said she now thinks it is in the boy's best interest to stay in this country at least temporarily
but reno a longtime friend did not back away from her support of the immigration and naturalization service's ruling that the boy be returned to his father
she would only change her mind i believe if she could find legal reasons to change her mind and have adequate evidence that that would be necessary o'laughlin said outside the justice department
reno after escorting o'laughlin to the department door said in a written statement that she had listened to all she had to say she told me about her feelings observations and conclusions
however reno said i continue to believe based on all the information available to me including the information that sister jeanne shared with me that the person who speaks for this child is his one surviving parent - his father
despite the stark difference of opinion the two women remained friendly at the end of their meeting o'laughlin said i left my meeting with janet reno with a gigantic hug and a promise that we will both keep pursuing the truth as we see it
the ins ruling has not been carried out because the federal government agreed to postpone action until the family had an opportunity to challenge it in court which elian's florida relatives have done filing a lawsuit in miami
a federal judge in miami was holding a hearing friday to reconsider timing of the lawsuit after a ruling thursday that appeared to suggest that a decision would not be made until march at the earliest
reno said she hoped the case would be resolved as quickly as possible
before meeting with reno o'laughlin visited sen connie mack r-fla chief sponsor of the citizenship bill and announced her support for it
the child has been in the torment of the seas and now he's been in the torment of political agendas somehow we must find for him calm seas at least for a while she said if it takes a congressional act to keep him here so be it she said
her support for the legislation came just as it appeared to be losing ground in congress elian's grandmothers made the rounds of capitol hill this week urging the boy's return to cuba
mack conceded that the grandmothers' visits had affected some of my colleagues costing potential support for his legislation but denied that o'laughlin's support for it would undermine her credibility or was intended on his part to counter the grandmothers' visits
we don't care about politics we care about our grandson said mariela quintana the paternal grandmother
the grandmothers might return to cuba this weekend said the rev joan brown campbell of the national council of churches which has facilitated their travel the meeting in reno's office ran more than an hour and a half twice the scheduled length also present were ins commissioner doris meissner and peg albert a child psychologist and colleague of sister jeanne the ins is part of the justice department
elian has been the center of an international tug of war since he was found clinging to an inner tube nov 25 off the florida coast his mother and others traveling with him from cuba had drowned
a new political party bidding to unite canada's conservatives would impose a flat tax and keep the country's two official languages - english and french
delegates to a convention in the capital were deciding the name and policies of the new party they also debated tougher law enforcement and immigration measures friday calling for more police on the streets and the immediate deportation of illegal aliens
the goal of the new party is to combine the western-based reform party the official opposition in parliament with supporters of the conservative party to create a rightist movement capable of toppling the governing liberal party in national elections expected in 2001
but conservative unity has been threatened by internal divisions over who would lead the new party and whether bedrock reform supporters in the western provinces can accept more mainstream policies needed to attract support in ontario the nation's most populous province
policies adopted friday included the flat-tax system which supporters say would exempt more lower-income canadians from income tax and reduce the rate for the highest earners who pay the majority of taxes
the reform party and the conservative party agree on lowering taxes but have differed over other issues the conservative party has a rich political history and more moderate views than the reform party which started in 1987 as a protest movement against what it called the federal government's lack of concern about western issues
in a signal of the new party's direction the more than 1000 delegates at the convention accepted canada's two national languages of french and english and recognized the federal government's responsibility to protect minority language rights the reform party previously opposed special status for the french language
another proposal friday would combine the nation's various security and intelligence-gathering agencies - including the royal canadian mounted police canadian security intelligence service foreign affairs ministry and immigration ministry - into a single department
it also would require the immediate deportation of anyone living illegally in canada instead of the current policy that includes lengthy appeals of deportation orders
no matter what happens at the conference and an accompanying reform party national conference in ottawa on saturday and sunday the final answer on whether the new party successfully merges the right won't be known until reform party members vote in march on whether to join up
nearly 14000 fans gathered in the first union center at the crack of dawn friday to witness one of the city's wackiest annual events a chicken wing-eating contest
twenty-two men ranging in size from average to 600-plus pounds competed for 30 minutes to see who could eat the most wings without throwing up the winner ate 82 wings
only in philly can this happen said john thompson 56 of philadelphia
tollbooth collector joseph paul 48 of bellmawr nj won a trip to aruba for downing 90 wings - though eight were disqualified
it was hard after i started but i knew i had the lead and i kept digging paul said
runner-up hank foldey of philadelphia finished 79 while 600-pound chris manger finished third
it's incredible it's brutal but i'll be back manger said
there was debate over whether one contestant threw up because he had his hands cupped over his mouth which would have disqualified him he was allowed to remain in the contest
the free event sponsored by wip radio is held the friday prior to the super bowl it has grown from a six-contestant 100-fan event in the lobby of a center city hotel in 1993 to a day-long celebration
guatemalan authorities on friday ordered a priest who is wanted in connection with the slaying of a bishop to appear before investigators or face extradition from the united states where he is living
attorney general leopoldo zeissig said rev mario orantes has three days to appear before investigators after that authorities plan to request his extradition
orantes 40 fled to the united states in october after complaining of threatening telephone calls according to his lawyer jose toledo who declined to specify where in the united states orantes is living
the priest had been jailed from july 1998 to february 1999 by authorities investigating the death of roman catholic bishop juan gerardi on monday authorities issued a warrant for his arrest again
gerardi 75 was found bludgeoned to death in his garage on april 26 1998 two days after presenting a human rights report that blamed the guatemalan military and pro-government death squads for atrocities committed during the country's 36-year civil war which ended in 1996
church leaders and human rights groups complained while orantes was being held that investigators had unjustly focused on the priest while ignoring a possible link to the military
in the past week police have arrested a former presidential guard a military officer and his father who is a retired officer in connection with the killing a church cook margarita lopez who had been jailed briefly in july 1998 also was arrested again
the arrests were based on testimony from ruben chamax sontay a man who was near the bishop's home on the night of the killing authorities said
the developments followed the jan 14 inauguration of president alfonso portillo who had pledged during his campaign to solve the crime which he called a national disgrace
the us economy propelled by hardy consumer spending finished 1999 on a vibrant note but the growth came at a price a worrisome uptick in wages and benefits that economists fear could trigger inflation wall street plunged
during the final three months of 1999 the economy grew at a breakneck annual rate of 58 percent the biggest growth spurt since the end of 1998 the commerce department said friday
for all of 1999 the nation's gross domestic product its total output of goods and services increased by 4 percent the third year in a row at 4 percent or higher
president clinton boasted about the economy at a white house meeting with mayors this unbelievable recovery marches on clinton said referring to the uninterrupted economic growth since the 1990-1991 recession that will set a record of eight years and ten months next week
at the same time another government report showed friday that employees' wages and benefits surged 11 percent in the fourth quarter rekindling worries about inflation and higher interest rates
amid these worries stocks tumbled the dow jones industrial average closed down 28915 points to 1073887 its lowest level since nov 11 the nasdaq fell 15250 points to 388706 its second-biggest point loss ever the bond market staged a stunning turnaround as jittery investors shifted their money away from stocks
the rising tide of economic growth has stirred up inflation in its wake said richard yamarone an economist with argus research corp
with the roaring economy driving down the nation's unemployment rate to its lowest point in 30 years employers are having trouble finding scarce workers to fill openings some employers are wooing workers with higher wages and benefits that's good for workers but economists fear those increased costs could lead to inflation
the 11 percent spike in the labor department's employment cost index considered the best measure of changes in wages and benefit costs and closely watched by federal reserve chairman alan greenspan stemmed from a 13 percent jump in benefits the biggest increase in six years economists blamed rising health care costs for the big increase in benefit costs
both reports contain the smoking gun that the fed has been worried about - wage pressures are surfacing and inflation is on the uptick said first union economist david orr
the federal reserve meets next week to decide interest rate policy and most economists expect the fed to boost rates by a quarter of a percentage point to slow the red-hot economy and keep inflation from escalating
a few economists said friday's reports may put pressure on the fed to bump up rates by a half a point on feb 2 but more economists said the reports raise the odds that the fed will follow up next week's expected increase with a quarter-of-a-point rate boost on march 21
despite the fed's three rate increases last year the economy continues to grow at a rapid pace that some economists fear cannot be sustained without triggering inflation
an inflation gauge tied to gdp rose 15 percent in 1999 a worse showing on inflation than the 07 percent increase recorded the year before
the best of inflation news is clearly behind us and if we keep growth at a 4 percent pace as we did in all of 1999 then the price problems will almost certainly worsen said economist joel naroff of naroff economic advisors
consumer spending which accounts for two-thirds of the country's economic activity drove 1999's growth rising 53 percent for the year plentiful jobs rising wages and benefits and stock market gains have made americans feel wealthy and put them in the mood to spend
all that spending pushed the nation's savings rate - savings as a percentage of disposable income - to an all-time annual low of 24 percent last year in 1998 the savings rate was 37 percent
that isn't as dire as it seems however because the savings rate doesn't take into account gains households have realized on their savings from such factors as rising stock market values and higher real estate values for their homes
business investment - spending on new equipment and plants - increased 83 percent last year down from 127 percent in 1998 rising mortgage rates dampened housing construction which rose 72 percent in 1999 but wasn't as brisk as the 92 percent increase the year before
the us trade deficit continued to be a drag on the economy subtracting 111 percentage points from growth in 1999 but that was a slight improvement from the 118 percentage-point reduction recorded in 1998
imports shot up 118 percent last year slightly more than the 116 percent increase posted in 1998 exports rose 35 percent last year compared with a 22 percent rise the year before
if five years ago the president had proposed simultaneous tax cuts spending increases and reduction of the national debt rep patrick kennedy d-ri said most people would have called the plan crazy
today the fact of the matter is it's a reality the question now is are we going to seize the day'  kennedy said thursday in response to president clinton's state of the union address
much of new england's heavily democratic congressional delegation similarly lauded the speech which included approximately $350 billion in tax cuts aimed at married couples and families sending children to college
but some including the region's few republicans suggested the package might be overly optimistic
i'm going to be very curious as to what all these programs add up to because it sounds quite expensive said rep christopher shays d-conn
we heard lots of beautiful phrases and so many billions of dollars we can't even count them said connecticut republican rep nancy johnson
still both johnson and shays saw areas the two parties can work together johnson for example was pleased clinton mentioned pension reform though she'd rather see a simplification of pension laws than clinton's proposed incentives to employers
some in the president's own party suggested reducing the national debt and supporting health care social security and education should take precedence over tax relief when i go around and talk to people they want health coverage prescription drugs no one is talking about tax breaks per se said rep j joseph moakley d-mass
sen chris dodd d-conn agreed i don't see anyone clamoring for a tax cut he suggested the money could be better spent expanding health care coverage to poor people
clinton's proposals aimed at expanding health coverage without creating an entirely new health system drew praise from rhode island democrat sen jack reed i think it's best to build upon the system that we have reed said
the working poor many of whom have not shared in the country's financial success would also benefits from clinton's proposal to create tax incentives for retirement savings accounts said sen joe lieberman d-conn this innovative market-oriented proposal will help change that imbalance and expand the winner's circle to include many of the families who are not yet sharing in this unprecedented prosperity lieberman said
new england lawmakers also applauded clinton's promise to spend more on education including an increase in pell grants and a tax deduction for college tuition the proposals mean hundred of new teachers for massachusetts schools and more after-school programs to keep children safe and help them with their schoolwork said massachusetts democrat sen edward m kennedy
responsible tax cuts can be balanced with the best economic stimulus we have ever known good schools that leave no child behind national standards and accountability and real reform for failing schools agreed sen john f kerry d-mass
venezuela's highest court has struck down a lawsuit claiming its own magistrates were appointed illegally by a powerful constitutional assembly overstepping its bounds
the ruling thursday was a setback for critics of president hugo chavez who say he has concentrated power into his own hands and brought the country dangerously close to dictatorship but it is also likely to stir further controversy about the way the president is carrying out his social revolution in venezuela
the same lawsuit claimed that a new mini-congress the attorney general the national comptroller the public defender and the national electoral council were all designated illegally each of those claims was shot down by venezuela's newly created supreme tribunal of justice
since becoming president a year ago chavez has pushed through a new constitution and decimated the two political parties that ruled the south american nation during 40 years of democracy
the new constitution approved by voters on dec 15 calls for the renewal of all elected powers but national balloting has been postponed until may because of last month's massive flooding and landslides that killed thousands of people on venezuela's northern coast
in the meantime chavez a former army paratrooper who staged a failed military coup eight years ago will be able to rule venezuela with virtually no checks on his power
on thursday 21 members of a so-called mini-congress made up of chavez supporters were sworn in the mini-congress's job will be to perform basic legislative functions until elections are held for a new legislature
like the high court magistrates the mini-congress's members were each handpicked by the chavez-controlled panel that rewrote the constitution
a venezuelan attorney named eduardo garcia presented a lawsuit to the court saying this was illegal
but the court ruled that the constitutional assembly had the power to make the appointments because it was given originating power by the venezuelan people in national elections
chavez and his supporters say the profound changes taking place in venezuelan society and politics will root out decades of corruption and crush a corrupt oligarchy that plunged the oil-rich nation into poverty
but the opposition says chavez has concentrated power into his own hands and brought the country dangerously close to dictatorship
vice president al gore has pulled ahead of bill bradley in new hampshire polls with a surge of support from men independents and registered democrats bradley is working to reverse the trend with aggressive campaigning
with four days left until the first-in-the-nation primary gore appears to have taken a boost from his strong campaign in iowa which resulted in a decisive win monday bradley's feisty performance in wednesday night's debate could help him but it's still too early to tell
a dartmouth college-associated press poll released friday gives gore a 54 percent to 40 percent lead over bradley the poll was conducted sunday through wednesday in the days just before and after gore's victory in the iowa caucuses
several other polls also taken during the days just before the debate showed gore with a double-digit lead including the franklin pierce college-wnds-tv poll which had gore with a 15-point lead
the last dartmouth-ap poll two weeks ago had bradley at 49 percent and gore at 43 a slight edge for bradley
in the republican race the latest dartmouth-ap poll had john mccain in a virtual tie with george w bush 37 percent to 34 percent publisher steve forbes had 15 percent in the dartmouth-ap poll two weeks ago mccain had 42 points bush 33 and forbes 11
mccain has a narrow lead in some polls based on his strength among independents bush's chance to catch him may depend on his ability to win over undecided republicans despite competition for their votes from conservatives forbes and alan keyes veteran pollsters say
the dartmouth-ap poll of 365 likely voters in the democratic primary and 435 likely voters in the republican primary has a margin of error of plus or minus 5 percentage points
linda fowler director of the rockefeller center polling institute at dartmouth college in hanover said gore's campaign has improved democrats who previously doubted whether he could win in november now think gore has a better chance she said
gore looks much more poised fowler said he's much clearer in terms of his message he's less jittery he looks more in control
that's reflected in poll numbers that showed likely voters saying gore is more likely to provide strong leadership than bradley they also said gore is much more likely to win both the new hampshire primary and november's general election bradley still has an edge in trustworthiness
dick bennett of american research group said his tracking poll showed bradley faring a little better thursday and gaining among independents but it was too early to say whether he could regain enough ground by tuesday's primary
bradley had drawn much of his strength from independents and men but the dartmouth-ap poll shows gore has surged among men and has regained an earlier advantage among women
two weeks ago 56 percent of men supported bradley and 38 percent backed gore in the dartmouth-ap poll but in the latest poll 51 percent of men are backing gore while 41 percent supported bradley
on the republican side mccain still ranks significantly higher than bush on voter perceptions that he is trustworthy and a strong leader but voters also think bush is more likely to prevail in the new hampshire primary and win the presidency in november
a sword-wielding man killed a liberal democrat party aide and injured a lawmaker friday at their office police said
the aide who was not immediately identified was reportedly stabbed at least 10 times
liberal democrat lawmaker nigel jones 51 suffered cuts to his hands and arms and was taken to a hospital in cheltenham about 100 miles northwest of london he was not seriously injured
the party said it knew of no motive for the attack and jones had not received any threats beforehand
but local councilor alexis cassin also a liberal democrat said she understood jones had been dealing with a difficult case involving the alleged attacker although she did not know the details of the case
cassin said she believed there were at least three people in the room at the time of the attack
cheltenham police refused to confirm the type of sword but witnesses speaking to the british broadcasting corp said it was similar to one used by a japanese samurai warrior though they did not offer any description of what that meant the witnesses also said the suspect went crazy in the lawmaker's office before he was chased up the street still carrying the weapon
police would give no details about the attack but said a 49-year-old local man was arrested near the party's headquarters and brought in for questioning
councilor brian cassin husband of alexis cassin said the lawmaker and his assistants had been preparing for their regular friday night office hours when they were attacked
mps do have a problem with angry aggrieved people mr jones and his assistants work very hard to deal with casework but you can't win them all
i have heard he was dealing with a bit of this man's work they were trying to help this man before tonight he said these people are here out of public duty to help
graham norton said his neighbor david copson had held the party aide in his arms and tried to resuscitate him
he tried his best to save this man and gave him mouth-to-mouth but he said there was a hole in the man's stomach norton said
home secretary jack straw offered condolences to the victim's family
members of parliament of all parties in this country are very accessible to their constituents and this makes this tragedy all the more dreadful straw said
jones won the cheltenham seat in 1992 and has been the party's spokesman on local government and housing science and technology consumer affairs and culture media and sports
the liberal democrats are britain's second-largest opposition party
environmental groups have sued new york state over what they contend are instances where motorized vehicles have been allowed onto sensitive public preserve areas in the adirondack and catskill mountains
the suit filed late thursday in federal court in albany claims that the state department of environmental conservation has engaged in a well-established and recurring pattern of improperly issuing permits for the use of motor vehicles snowmobiles and all-terrain vehicles in state forest preserves
the claim alleges that motorized vehicles have caused the destruction of trees noise pollution exhaust vapors and odors degradation of hiking trails erosion from motor vehicle traffic and disturbance and destruction of habitat areas
among the areas where motor vehicles have allegedly been misused are the santononi preserve and the groups also say the dec improperly bulldozed a wide trail for snowmobilers through the vanderwacker mountain wild forest tract
both parcels of land are in the adirondacks
the groups said they know of at least 30 instances where permits for vehicle use appear to have been issued illegally by the dec despite what they say were their repeated warnings to the state over the past three years
the destruction is not being accomplished so much by the vehicles but by the changes to the landscape they are making to accommodate the vehicles john sheehan a spokesman for the adirondack council said friday
the dec revised its permit procedures in december to make sure they adhered to forest preserve protection rules the state's land use master plan and other guidelines department spokeswoman jennifer post said friday
we simply don't agree with their contentions she said of the environmental groups
post said the dec was also challenging the groups' right to bring the suit in federal court
the groups said their suit does not seek any change in the use of motorized vehicles that have been won by individuals with disabilities or to limit where law enforcement personnel are allowed to venture
the appellate division of state supreme court last year ruled the groups' suit could be brought on constitutional grounds the environmentalists are contending that the state is failing to protect the forest preserve lands as required by an 1894 amendment to the state constitution
the four groups suing were the adirondack council the residents' committee to protect the adirondacks the association for the protection of the adirondacks and environmental advocates
the suit was filed before us district court judge lawrence kahn
venezuela's highest court has struck down a lawsuit claiming its own magistrates were appointed illegally by a powerful constitutional assembly overstepping its bounds
the ruling thursday was a setback for critics of president hugo chavez who say he has concentrated power into his own hands and brought the country dangerously close to dictatorship but it is also likely to stir further controversy about the way the president is carrying out his social revolution in venezuela
the same lawsuit claimed that a new mini-congress the attorney general the national comptroller the public defender and the national electoral council were all designated illegally each of those claims was shot down by venezuela's newly created supreme tribunal of justice
since becoming president a year ago chavez has pushed through a new constitution and decimated the two political parties that ruled the south american nation during 40 years of democracy
the new constitution approved by voters on dec 15 calls for the renewal of all elected powers but national balloting has been postponed until may because of last month's massive flooding and landslides that killed thousands of people on venezuela's northern coast
in the meantime chavez a former army paratrooper who staged a failed military coup eight years ago will be able to rule venezuela with virtually no checks on his power
on thursday 21 members of a so-called mini-congress made up of chavez supporters were sworn in the mini-congress's job will be to perform basic legislative functions until elections are held for a new legislature

snacking on chocolate needn't be a guilt trip a candy maker assures consumers in a web site that suggests there may be health benefits to eating the treat
mars inc the hackettstown-based maker of m&ampm's snickers and 3 musketeers stops short of claiming chocolate is a health food but it is believed to be the first major chocolate manufacturer to promote research on the possible disease-fighting properties of the plant compounds found in the candy
everyone knows that chocolate tastes great most don't know that chocolate may provide certain health benefits the good news is eating well can include chocolate according to the web site wwwcocoaprocom
the site said preliminary research suggests that cocoa beans contain antioxidants called polyphenols which may reduce the risk of heart disease
the cocoapro logo - a graphic of a hand holding a cocoa bean - will appear on the back of candy bar wrappers beginning this quarter with the hopes that consumers will turn to the web site to ease their conscience
hershey foods corp and nestle usa both mars competitors are not promoting the health benefits of their products
laurie macdonald at nestle said however that her company finds the research interesting and promising and is following it closely
the chocolate manufacturers association has its own web site touting the health benefits of chocolate the site notes that research suggests eating a chocolate bar instead of a high carbohydrate snack raises good cholesterol levels
one researcher who has done several studies on chocolate's health properties also said it has been found to have some benefits
our work shows that chocolate does have antioxidant effects which could protect against heart disease premature aging and possibly cancer no doubt about it said penny kris-etherton a nutrition professor at penn state university
but are the findings ready to be plastered on product labels
the effect on major chronic diseases is open to discussions she said
bruce silverglade legal director for the center for science in the public interest a nonprofit organization that advocates food safety and nutrition said friday that mars is using its web site to make assertions that the federal government has not yet approved for its packaging
this is irresponsible health advice said silverglade he warned that many candy bars contain a significant amount of saturated fats which have been proven to raise blood cholesterol levels and increase the risk of heart disease
the federal food and drug administration has not approved any health claims for chocolate any such claims on the candy wrapper would require fda authorization
marlene machut a spokeswoman for mars said the company is not suggesting replacing fruits and vegetables with a snickers bar
we support what nutritionists have been saying moderation and a balanced diet is the key to healthy living chocolate can certainly fit into a healthy diet and a healthy lifestyle she said people need to enjoy their food
the euro fell to new lows friday dropping below 98 cents for the first time ever and winding up below $1 for a second straight day the euro's retreat helped the dollar stage a broad advance against other leading currencies on a day when us stocks fell sharply
the euro sank as low as 9738 cents friday afternoon and settled at 9778 cents in late trading in new york down from 9886 cents thursday the dollar also climbed to 10698 japanese yen from 10509 yen
during a day of dramatic changes the dollar hit a 10-year high against the swiss franc a 3 1/2-month high against the yen a 4-week high against the british pound and a 12-month high against the new zealand dollar
the dollar was aided by reports friday that the us economy galloped ahead at an annual rate of 58 percent during the final quarter of 1999 the largest burst of growth since late 1998
the figures reinforced views among traders that the american economy will continue to outperform the economy of the 11 european nations that have adopted the euro
investors in several markets and at least one hedge fund added to the euro's plight by dumping the currency to buy dollars the selling shifted money into the us bond market where long-term interest rates fell despite inflation jitters that sent us stocks stumbling
the euro now has lost 177 percent since peaking on the day it made its debut as a currency - jan 4 1999
european union officials continued to downplay the significance of friday's fall
however investors speculated that officials at the european central bank had to be upset and might finally consider raising interest rates to boost the currency at their management committee meeting next thursday
for the ecb this is their worst nightmare said paul podolsky a managing director at fleet global foreign exchange in boston while a psychological blow the low euro is providing some benefits by making european goods less costly and more competitive on world markets
henry willmore a senior economist at barclays capital said that if the downfall continues below 96 cents there is a pretty good risk of intervention i think they were caught by surprise by the euro's moves in recent days
in other trading the dollar was quoted at 16468 swiss francs in new york up from 16316 thursday and 14430 canadian dollars up from 14337 the british pound fell to $16210 from $16388
currencies participating in the euro are no longer traded separately and are tied to the euro by a fixed rate based on the euro's rate friday the dollar was worth 20006german marks down from 19780 67085 french francs up from 66339 and 198023 italian lire up from 195820
the number of rigs actively exploring for oil and natural gas in the united states fell this week by 22 to 755
of the rigs running nationwide 131 were exploring for oil and 624 were looking for gas houston-based baker hughes inc reported friday during the same week last year 562 rigs were operating in the united states
baker hughes has kept track of the count since 1944 the tally peaked at 4530 on dec 28 1981 during the height of the oil boom but set several record lows last year bottoming out at 498 on april 9 1999
of the major oil- and gas-producing states new mexico gained three while alaska and louisiana lost one apiece texas lost 10 rigs while california oklahoma and wyoming were unchanged
the location and the purpose may be different but the un's trade and development body likely may face the same problems that led to the high-profile failure of last month's world trade organization meeting
a draft text for next month's un conference on trade and development in bangkok completed friday champions free trade as the best way for poorer countries to improve their economies and living standards
but many of the issues that haunted the wto's seattle gathering are also set to rear their heads at the bangkok meeting which starts feb 12
unctad considers the text - which will now be passed to delegates in bangkok for final approval - a success it contains only 15 disputed areas said spokeswoman carine richard-van maele the document produced for unctad's last meeting four years ago had 590
but the disputed areas of the 37-page text bear a striking resemblance to the wto disagreements - agriculture labor standards and an end to all trade barriers for the poorest countries in some cases the wording is identical
for example a european union proposal would insert a paragraph pointing to the importance of democracy rule of law transparent and accountable governance and administration human rights and fundamental freedoms developing countries have resisted all suggestions that trade negotiations should be linked to human rights
at the same time the european union rejects suggestions that its huge agricultural subsidy program is having negative effects on developing countries
the united states whose negotiators had to leave before the end of the meeting has also registered a general reservation over the entire section covering trade
i don't deny that there are substantial differences that remain unctad secretary-general rubens ricupero told the associated press
they will need a long process a great effort until now we have seen practically no willingness to compromise bangkok is another opportunity to see those compromises and in a way that will not commit the countries to make a decision that would be more or less irrevocable
the nations have agreed on some provisions including the need for writing off debts for the world's poorest countries
there is also general agreement that developing countries must be given help to develop trading policies that encourage investment and allow them to take part in the e-commerce revolution
some 3000 participants including heads of state from unctad's 199 members are expected to attend the conference feb 12-19
the guy's 53 years old but when he's being praised by a former president as the best man for the white house he probably doesn't mind that he keeps being referred to as my boy
former president bush used the term several times during his speech at a campaign rally friday plugging for george w bush in this year's election
bush the younger is a man of character who believes in his country the father said of the son
the former president also poked some fun at himself joking that he is going through a bit of an identity crisis because of his son's rising prominence
he said a hairdresser told his wife barbara bush that he was excited to be doing the hair of the mother of the governor of texas
when mrs bush reminded him that she also was the wife of the former president the hairdresser said well there's that too
by the numbers
65 - percentage of americans who say they paid no attention or just a little attention to the presidential campaign the week before the voting actually began in iowa from the vanishing voter poll taken jan 19-24
voter's voice
i'm more interested in the issues this is a bit abrasive we're going to go see al gore tomorrow and then we'll make up our mind - undecided democratic new hampshire voter amos johnson who heard some of bill bradley's most recent criticisms of al gore on friday
this date four years ago
phil gramm called it inconceivable that publisher steve forbes could beat president clinton if forbes became the gop nominee it would be richie rich against tom sawyer gramm said there's no way you could possibly win that race
friday's roundup
bill bradley stepped up his criticism of his democratic rival when you listen to al gore speak you have to listen very carefully you have to look at every word and every clause gore who returned from the state of the union address to appear with former treasury secretary robert rubin at a campaign event dismissed bradley's remarks and said he wanted to emphasize the positive
bush picked up the endorsement of his father's former white house chief of staff former new hampshire gov john sununu he also criticized president clinton's new tax cut plan as not significant enough rival john mccain said he was truly disappointed that bush hadn't stopped supporters' efforts to knock mccain off one-fourth of the ballots for the party's new york primary he was joined in a lawsuit to change the party's rules by steve forbes
weekend trail
bradley campaigns throughout new hampshire all weekend participating in town halls and rallies across the state gore also campaigns in the state
republicans all focus on the granite state as well this weekend mccain holds a series of town halls bush attends a republican dinner in keene saturday and a super bowl party in portsmouth sunday forbes holds rallies across the state gary bauer stumps across the state and speaks to a citizen-based educational group in henniker saturday alan keyes campaigns through the state
north korea has discovered more than 400 remains of people likely to be american servicemen killed in the korean war a deputy north korean representative to the united nations said friday
li gun said his country has offered to return the remains without conditions he said the us government would have to act quickly because the area where the remains were found in december and january is being converted to cropland
at the pentagon office in charge of pow-mia affairs spokesman larry greer said north korea notified the pentagon of the discovery this week
we've asked for more details greer said he said his office is leery of unilateral returns of war remains because in the past they have lacked the anthropological detail needed for individual identifications
in a telephone interview from his new york office li said his government believes it will find many more remains beyond the approximately 415 already uncovered in an area of north pyongan province where land is being moved to create cropland
about 8200 us servicemen are listed as missing from the 1950-53 korean war and the pentagon has said it believes a few thousand are potentially recoverable from north korea in joint recovery operations over the past few years 42 sets of remains have been recovered negotiations on arranging joint recovery operations for this year broke down in december after the north koreans demanded that the united states donate materials and equipment for children's clothing factories
on tuesday li's office sent letters to several us veterans organizations that said some remains of the us troops killed in the korean war are being recovered by bulldozers the letter did not mention the 400 figure it said that once the land-moving operation is finished it will be difficult for us to confirm the remains sites and unable to find the remains forever
frank metersky of the chosin few group of korean war veterans said friday he doubts the north koreans' sincerity
we all agree this is a political ploy to get the pentagon involved in humanitarian assistance as a condition for the return of remains he said we do not want our government to pay ransom
li said his government had suggested but not demanded that the united states donate children's clothing factories as a means of compensating north korea for its cooperation in remains-recovery operations he said the intent was to show average north korean citizens whose help he said is vital to recovering remains that the united states is well intentioned and is no longer the enemy
cocoa careened close to a 13-year low friday on new york's coffee sugar &amp cocoa exchange as strong west african harvests heap more supplies onto a glutted world market
in other commodity markets gold prices retreated sharply and wheat fell after snow fell in the southern plains states
cocoa prices have been in a tailspin since 1998 continued lackluster demand coupled with whopper crops in ivory coast and ghana the world's top two producers are pressuring the market further
world production is expected to exceed demand this year for the first time since the 1995-96 marketing year rising 6 percent while grindings - reflecting consumption - climb just 3 percent according to new figures released by trade house ed&ampf man
crops arriving in west african ports for shipment are large ed&ampf man says ivory coast benefiting from favorable growing conditions is on pace for a record while ghana should have its largest crop since 1972-73 indonesia the no 3 world producer also is expected to produce a record crop
there's no attempt to keep cocoa off the market that really has kept prices down said jack scoville vice president and analyst with the chicago-based price futures group
it's a good crop and along with the liberalization the imf has forced on these countries it certainly hasn't slowed down the speed at which cocoa moves out he said
cocoa settled down $12 at $811 a ton after sinking as low as $805 - just $5 off the 13-year low reached last month
gold's decline caught some investors off guard amid uncertainty over what caused it some rumors said a large hedge fund was forced to sell a substantial position of its holdings in gold perhaps due to credit problems other traders speculated that the strength in the us dollar contributing to the slide
the expiring february contract settled $410 lower at $283 an ounce on the new york mercantile exchange after bottoming out at $28050
wheat declined on the chicago board of trade after snowy weather struck the southern plains states and much of the nation's winter wheat crop the day before easing concerns about crop dryness a decline in corn and soybean prices added to the selling mood
march wheat fell 3 3/4 cents to $259 3/4 a bushel
state utility regulators on friday reversed a decision that would have cut rates for southern connecticut gas customers and instead granted the company a rate hike
the decision from the state department of public utility control will result in a 3 cent-per-month increase for an average customer who does not heat with natural gas
the decision came despite a preliminary ruling earlier this month that would have required the gas company to cut rates by about 22 cents per month on average
some utility analysts said the preliminary ruling might have killed plans for energy east corp to take over southern connecticut gas
both companies refused to comment on the final decision friday saying it was still being reviewed
the companies also refused to say whether the merger hinged on the dpuc ruling the dpuc already has approved the merger but the companies still need approval from the us securities and exchange commission
the rate decision was changed because of miscalculations in the preliminary ruling the dpuc said
the ruling will still result in smaller profit limits for the company the dpuc set maximum earnings at 1071 percent down from the 1145 percent maximum profit that was set in 1993
southern connecticut gas which serves 158000 customers in the new haven and bridgeport areas requested increased revenues of $20 million the dpuc instead granted revenue increases of $502000
energy east of albany ny also plans to pay $355 million to take over hartford-based ctg resources inc the parent company of connecticut natural gas corp the company has also made offers for central maine power co and berkshire energy resources in massachusetts
federal regulators on friday ordered the nation's stock exchanges to begin quoting at least some share prices in dollars and cents by july 3 requiring them to fully abandon the 200-year-old use of fractions by year's end
the new york stock exchange the nasdaq stock market and other us securities exchanges will be required to submit a decimal pricing plan within 45 days and to have decimal prices fully phased in by year's end the securities and exchange commission said in announcing its order
the exchanges have been putting together plans for phasing in decimal prices this year now that the securities industry has cleared the year 2000 technological hurdle
the sec normally refrains from intervening in the markets' operation
sec spokesman chris ullman explained that the agency was seeking to promote a greater level of coordination within the industry and with the sec the move was intended to reaffirm how important we think this is he said
the securities industry association said the sec's action clears the way for the securities industry to proceed with its effort to convert to decimal pricing
this will make securities trading more understandable for investors as well as increasing the competitiveness of us markets the sia said in a statement
decimal trading will benefit investors by allowing greater competition and making it easier to compare prices sec chairman arthur levitt said in a statement it will also bring about consistency with foreign markets which now trade in decimals we look forward to working with the industry to ensure that the transition to decimals goes smoothly
as an interim step the nation's two biggest exchanges - the nyse and the all-electronic nasdaq - and some regional exchanges have been quoting stocks in minimum increments of one-sixteenth of a dollar instead of the customary one-eighths in decimals a sixteenth is 625 cents and an eighth is 125 cents
the nyse is decimal-ready we will continue to work with the sec and the industry toward a smooth conversion to decimal pricing exchange spokesman rich adamonis said
nasdaq spokesman scott peterson said his exchange will be ready to trade in 5-cent increments on july 3 and looks forward to discussing the implications of quoting securities in 1-cent increments with the sec
supporters say adopting the decimal system would narrow the difference between a stock's best bid and asking prices known as the spread spreads typically vary from 12 1/2 cents to 50 cents an amount that adds up to a sizable profit for brokers who take in a percentage based on the size of the spread
some stocks will begin trading in nickel increments though many could be trading in penny increments by the end of the year
proponents of the decimalization argue that a narrower spread will increase the competitiveness and efficiency of markets increase trading volume and improve liquidity
by contrast critics have said the narrower spreads in decimal trading would erode profits something that could reduce the number of market makers the firms which form a market's backbone
market makers trade for their own accounts and agree to process customers' orders for particular stocks a sharp drop in market makers could hurt an exchange's ability to handle high-volume trading sessions
in the final hours of international talks friday on trade in genetically modified food and other products negotiators found themselves grappling over the same issues that doomed a similar agreement nearly a year ago
delegates scurried from room to room of the montreal hotel where the meeting was being held bearing proposals and counterproposals late in the afternoon conference president juan mayr delayed what was to be the final meeting of the disagreeing parties by four hours
mayr who set a deadline of friday night also has said that he will not leave montreal without an agreement
somebody has to give in somewhere said ethiopian head delegate towalde egziabher
negotiators were attempting to draft the biosafety protocol a set of rules that would protect the environment from damage by genetically modified plants animals and bacteria environmentalists and a few scientific studies have raised concerns that genetically modified organisms could wipe out native species disrupt natural cycles and cause other ecological damage
there's fish genes in fruit poultry genes in fish animal genes in plants growth hormones in milk insect genes in vegetables tree genes in grain and in the case of pork human genes in meat said steve gilman an organic farmer in stillwater ny real and reasonable concerns about genetic engineering have fallen upon deaf ears
the debate at the talks has revolved around how great the scientific uncertainty is and how it should be dealt with the european union and developing nations have argued that countries should be allowed to decline imports of a genetically modified product if little is known about its environmental effect
but the united states and its partners disagree saying the proposed rules in their current form would restrict trade those countries argued that any nation's refusal to import a genetically modified product should be backed by scientific evidence in the form of a risk assessment
we live in a world in which scientific certainty is not available said us undersecretary of state frank loy
talks last february in cartagena colombia ended in disarray when the united states and five other countries - canada australia argentina chile and uruguay - rejected a draft agreement favored by 125 other countries
the situation has changed since then with major us food producers such as archer daniels midland gerber and the iams pet food company either demanding that genetically modified products be segregated or refusing to use them altogether protests at the world trade organization talks in seattle last month also suggest that the american public has concerns about genetically altered food
in the year since cartagena it has become obvious that the position of the united states' group is increasingly isolated said philip bereano a university of washington professor who has been following the talks
just as in cartagena the talks in montreal have come down to a handful of issues
the relationship of the proposed rules to the world trade organization the united states wants the agreement to have equal status with the free trade pact but other countries fear that any bans they impose will be overturned by the world trade organization's dispute resolution panel
the amount of scientific evidence that is needed to justify banning a genetically modified product
the amount of evidence that exporters must provide about their products
genetically modified crops are already widespread about 70 million acres of genetically engineered plants were cultivated worldwide in 1999 in the united states genetically engineered varieties account for about 25 percent of corn and 40 percent of soybeans
chinese authorities freed a us college librarian on friday five months after they arrested him on charges of smuggling secret documents out of the country us and chinese officials said here
song yongyi who works at dickinson college in carlisle pa was scheduled to arrive in philadelphia on saturday afternoon
state department spokesman james foley said the us government was pleased by china's decision but did not believe there was any evidence to warrant his detention
however china's ambassador to the united states said in a statement that song admitted all the facts related to his criminal activities and also voluntarily revealed evidence against illegal activities of others
song's case was treated with leniency because of his repentance said the ambassador li zhao xing
song a 50-year-old chinese national who had planned to become a us citizen in september was on a trip to china in august to collect source material on the 1966-76 cultural revolution when he and his wife helen yao were detained his wife was allowed to return to the united states in november
dickinson officials have said song was collecting previously published material to bring to the united states but the chinese contended he was purchasing or illegally supplying intelligence to people outside china
foley cited the efforts of secretary of state madeleine k albright sen arlen specter r-pa and several congressional delegations that visited china for pressuring the chinese government to release song
specter said he learned of song's release during a meeting with li at the chinese embassy in washington on friday morning he said he believes chinese authorities released song to curry favor with congress which will decide whether to grant china permanent most-favored-nation trade status
they know they'll need our votes said specter who declined to comment on song's alleged confession

the us economy propelled by hardy consumer spending finished 1999 on a vibrant note but the growth came at a price a worrisome uptick in wages and benefits that economists fear could trigger inflation wall street plunged
during the final three months of 1999 the economy grew at a breakneck annual rate of 58 percent the biggest growth spurt since the end of 1998 the commerce department said friday
for all of 1999 the nation's gross domestic product its total output of goods and services increased by 4 percent the third year in a row at 4 percent or higher
president clinton boasted about the economy at a white house meeting with mayors this unbelievable recovery marches on clinton said referring to the uninterrupted economic growth since the 1990-1991 recession that will set a record of eight years and ten months next week
at the same time another government report showed friday that employees' wages and benefits surged 11 percent in the fourth quarter rekindling worries about inflation and higher interest rates
amid these worries stocks tumbled the dow jones industrial average closed down 28915 points to 1073887 its lowest level since nov 11 the nasdaq fell 15249 points to 388707 its second-biggest point loss ever the bond market staged a stunning turnaround as jittery investors shifted their money away from stocks
the rising tide of economic growth has stirred up inflation in its wake said richard yamarone an economist with argus research corp
with the roaring economy driving down the nation's unemployment rate to its lowest point in 30 years employers are having trouble finding scarce workers to fill openings some employers are wooing workers with higher wages and benefits that's good for workers but economists fear those increased costs could lead to inflation
the 11 percent spike in the labor department's employment cost index considered the best measure of changes in wages and benefit costs and closely watched by federal reserve chairman alan greenspan stemmed from a 13 percent jump in benefits the biggest increase in six years economists blamed rising health care costs for the big increase in benefit costs
both reports contain the smoking gun that the fed has been worried about - wage pressures are surfacing and inflation is on the uptick said first union economist david orr
the federal reserve meets next week to decide interest rate policy and most economists expect the fed to boost rates by a quarter of a percentage point to slow the red-hot economy and keep inflation from escalating
a few economists said friday's reports may put pressure on the fed to bump up rates by a half a point on feb 2 but more economists said the reports raise the odds that the fed will follow up next week's expected increase with a quarter-of-a-point rate boost on march 21
despite the fed's three rate increases last year the economy continues to grow at a rapid pace that some economists fear cannot be sustained without triggering inflation
an inflation gauge tied to gdp rose 15 percent in 1999 a worse showing on inflation than the 07 percent increase recorded the year before
the best of inflation news is clearly behind us and if we keep growth at a 4 percent pace as we did in all of 1999 then the price problems will almost certainly worsen said economist joel naroff of naroff economic advisors
consumer spending which accounts for two-thirds of the country's economic activity drove 1999's growth rising 53 percent for the year plentiful jobs rising wages and benefits and stock market gains have made americans feel wealthy and put them in the mood to spend
all that spending pushed the nation's savings rate - savings as a percentage of disposable income - to an all-time annual low of 24 percent last year in 1998 the savings rate was 37 percent
that isn't as dire as it seems however because the savings rate doesn't take into account gains households have realized on their savings from such factors as rising stock market values and higher real estate values for their homes
business investment - spending on new equipment and plants - increased 83 percent last year down from 127 percent in 1998 rising mortgage rates dampened housing construction which rose 72 percent in 1999 but wasn't as brisk as the 92 percent increase the year before
the us trade deficit continued to be a drag on the economy subtracting 111 percentage points from growth in 1999 but that was a slight improvement from the 118 percentage-point reduction recorded in 1998
imports shot up 118 percent last year slightly more than the 116 percent increase posted in 1998 exports rose 35 percent last year compared with a 22 percent rise the year before
lockheed martin corp slashed its dividend in half friday continuing a belt-tightening that already includes plans for 2800 new job cuts in an attempt to reverse setbacks at its aerospace and aviation businesses
the nation's second-largest defense business after boeing co also reported fourth-quarter earnings after excluding one-time gains fell 20 percent from a year earlier matching wall street's diminished expectations
lockheed officials reiterated a warning first made in october year that the bleak financial picture would continue into the new year but projected gains in the years to come
we have a very strong conviction that the year 2000 will be the low point for earnings and cash generation for this corporation chief financial officer robert j stevens told analysts in a telephone conference call friday
lockheed stock fell about 3 percent for the second day in a row dropping 56 1/4 cents to $1887 1/2 in trading at 515 pm on the new york stock exchange
cutting quarterly dividend payments from 22 cents a share to 11 cents effective with the payout due march 31 is the latest in a series of measures aimed at improving the bottom line reducing the dividend frees up about $180 million analysts said
consistent with our previously announced focus on reducing debt it is prudent to change the dividend at this time said vance coffman the chairman and chief executive of the bethesda md-based maker of rockets satellites and the f-16 fighter jet
on thursday the company announced it was eliminating 2 percent of its 140000 jobs worldwide lockheed said the new cuts of 2800 jobs in its aircraft and rockets businesses would produce $200 million in annual savings the latest retrenchment brings the total number of jobs eliminated in recent months to 4500
the purpose of these actions is to drive down indirect and administrative costs to improve earnings and cash flow and reduce debt while improving focus on these businesses coffman said friday
lockheed said it was considering whether to add another subsidiary lockheed martin ims to the list of eight company businesses on the auction block the teaneck nj-based unit which had sales of $500 million last year provides services to government including child-support collection and ticketing drivers caught on red-light cameras
company officials also said they planned to close a deal to acquire bethesda-based comsat corp in the first six months of 2000 lockheed bought 49 percent of the satellite service provider last year but cannot purchase the rest until congress changes comsat's ownership rules to allow it the house and senate are expected to begin working out final legislation next month
analysts gave mixed reviews
all the bad news is out we think the stock is in the midst of a turnaround said jeff pittsburg of pittsburg institutional inc who is advising his clients to buy the stock i think the dividends the layoffs they're trying to create the cash flow they're telling you they're going to generate a lot of cash and that's very important
paul nisbet of jsa research inc has a hold on the stock which he says is in limbo
the prospects as they have outlined them to us certainly aren't very bright he said it doesn't exactly exude confidence
for the fourth quarter of 1999 lockheed reported earnings of $293 million or 76 cents a share compared with $125 million or 33 cents a share in the same 1998 period
profit in the latest quarter included $102 million or 17 cents a share in one-time gains from the sale of surplus real estate noncore businesses and the company's stock in l3 communication holdings the earnings of 59 cents after eliminating the unusual gains met the average estimate of analysts surveyed by first call/thomson financial
for the year lockheed earned $382 million or 99 cents a share compared with $1 billion or $263 a share in 1998 excluding one-time charges earnings for 1999 would have been $150 vs $299 for the previous year
in october the company cut its earnings forecast for 2000 by more than half to about $1 per share and lockheed saw its stock lose nearly half its value
but the company also said it expected earnings per share to grow at an annual rate of 15 percent to 25 percent in the near term with growth at the lower end of the range in 2001
lockheed's problems have been aggravated by troubles in its space systems business there have been several rocket launch failures as well as satellite delays and the loss of satellite contracts such as a long-held us spy satellite contract reportedly worth $45 billion
sales of the company's flagship aircraft the f-16 fighter jet have dwindled lockheed delivered 109 of the planes in 1998 down from 150 in the previous year the company now is almost entirely dependent on foreign sales
the thruway authority board has quietly approved a 3 percent toll hike beginning june 1 to pay for improvements to the superhighway and other transportation projects
the board thursday voted to go forward with a previously unannounced plan to tie future toll increases on the thruway to the construction cost index which is an average of construction material and labor costs the first-year hike will be 3 percent the maximum annual increase under the new toll increase system
tolls at the short-trip barriers around buffalo and new york city would not go up because they are rounded to the nearest quarter but virtually all other tolls on the ticketed part of the superhighway would go up by 3 percent rounded to the nearest nickel
thruway officials will hold four public hearings to gather comment on the toll-increase plan and finalize the plan this spring thruway spokeswoman anya frost said
tolls were last raised on the thruway the nation's longest toll road in 1988 in 1996 the thruway board backed away from a toll hike at the insistence of gov george pataki
there was little if any advance word that the board was contemplating a toll hike before thursday's meeting the press release issued by the authority afterward spoke of the agency funding $275 million in capital improvements this year not until the second page of the release did the authority refer to the adoption of a plan which could result in an annual toll hike - it called it an indexed toll adjustment plan - beginning june 1
this common-sense plan will ensure that motorists are never hit with massive toll hikes while providing businesses that rely on the thruway with the information they need when planning their budgets the authority said in a statement from chairman louis tomson
the majority leader of the state senate said friday he is opposed to raising tolls joseph bruno cited such a hike as running counter to recent state efforts to cut taxes and other costs of doing business in the state
now is not the time for the thruway authority to impose a hidden tax on upstate businesses residents and commuters in the form of multiyear toll hikes bruno r-rensselaer said
the state motor truck association blasted the authority for the secretive manner in which it voted to raise tolls and said it appeared there was nothing to prevent tolls from going up 3 percent every year if construction costs continue to rise annually
as business people we would never increase our prices to our largest customers without first consulting with them grumbled the motor truck association's president bill joyce
it called on pataki to ask the thruway authority to reexamine its projected toll hike and to find other ways to fund improvements on the roadway calls to pataki's office for comment about the projected toll increase were not immediately returned friday
under the $275 million in projects to be put out for bid this year by the thruway was worked on the interstate 287 corridor around the tappan zee bridge and the syracuse inner harbor development project
both projects are among the transportation facilities the thruway has assumed authority for in recent years critics say the drain of these other facilities have put additional financial burdens on the authority past that of maintaining the original toll highway between new york city and the pennsylvania border
tomson was a former deputy to pataki and was nominated by the governor to the thruway position it is unlikely that the thruway authority board would proceed with a toll hike plan without the prior knowledge of pataki's office
two women were injured when neo-nazi youths clashed with anti-racism demonstrators late friday in northeastern spain news reports said
the clashes followed a relatively peaceful march of 200 people through premia de mar when a group of 30 skinheads carrying nazi symbols and spanish flags began throwing stones at them the state-owned news agency efe reported two women were reported injured
the march was called to protest anti-immigrant sentiments that rose to the surface after a fight earlier in the week between a north african and a spaniard
last july anti-immigrant violence erupted in parts of the northeastern region of catalonia where premia is located anti-immigrant demonstrators then attacked shops and homes belonging to moroccans and clashed with police
snacking on chocolate needn't be a guilt trip a candy maker assures consumers in a web site that suggests there may be health benefits to eating the treat
mars inc the hackettstown-based maker of m&ampm's snickers and 3 musketeers stops short of claiming chocolate is a health food but it is believed to be the first major chocolate manufacturer to promote research on the possible disease-fighting properties of the plant compounds found in the candy
everyone knows that chocolate tastes great most don't know that chocolate may provide certain health benefits the good news is eating well can include chocolate according to the web site wwwcocoaprocom
the site said preliminary research suggests that cocoa beans contain antioxidants called polyphenols which may reduce the risk of heart disease
the cocoapro logo - a graphic of a hand holding a cocoa bean - will appear on the back of candy bar wrappers beginning this quarter with the hopes that consumers will turn to the web site to ease their conscience
hershey foods corp and nestle usa both mars competitors are not promoting the health benefits of their products
laurie macdonald at nestle said however that her company finds the research interesting and promising and is following it closely
the chocolate manufacturers association has its own web site touting the health benefits of chocolate the site notes that research suggests eating a chocolate bar instead of a high carbohydrate snack raises good cholesterol levels
one researcher who has done several studies on chocolate's health properties said their studies it does have some benefits
our work shows that chocolate does have antioxidant effects which could protect against heart disease premature aging and possibly cancer said penny kris-etherton a nutrition professor at penn state university
bruce silverglade legal director for the center for science in the public interest a nonprofit organization that advocates food safety and nutrition said friday that mars is using its web site to make assertions that the federal government has not yet approved for its packaging
this is irresponsible health advice said silverglade he warned that many candy bars contain a significant amount of saturated fats which have been proven to raise blood cholesterol levels and increase the risk of heart disease
the federal food and drug administration has not approved any health claims for chocolate any such claims on the candy wrapper would require fda authorization
marlene machut a spokeswoman for mars said the company is not suggesting replacing fruits and vegetables with a snickers bar
we support what nutritionists have been saying moderation and a balanced diet is the key to healthy living chocolate can certainly fit into a healthy diet and a healthy lifestyle she said people need to enjoy their food
the dalai lama has urged india to grant refuge to a prominent teen-age buddhist monk who fled chinese-ruled tibet saying it would be a terrible mistake not to allow him to stay in the country
in a letter released to reporters friday the tibetan buddhist leader said india's image would suffer if the government does not allow the 17th karmapa to stay since arriving in india earlier this month the 14-year-old karmapa has been staying at a monastery near dharmsala the dalai lama's headquarters
the letter was written jan 18 to rabi ray a former speaker of the lok sabha india's lower house of parliament ray released the letter to reporters in the eastern city of bhubaneswar
it would be a terrible mistake for india if the government does not let the karmapa stay on the dalai lama said in the letter
buddhist groups have demanded that the karmapa be allowed asylum in the rumtek monastery in india's northeastern state of sikkim where his deceased predecessor - who fled tibet in 1959 - established the seat of his karma kagyu sect
the indian express newspaper reported on sunday that the dalai lama also wrote to indian prime minister atal bihari vajpayee supporting the karmapa's request to stay the foreign ministry and the dalai lama's administration refused to confirm the report
india has allowed more than 100000 tibetan refugees to settle within its borders since a failed 1959 uprising against chinese rule the dalai lama heads an exile government in dharmsala
china has said the monk would be welcomed back but the chinese government will continue to control ordination of key buddhist religious figures
at a news conference in washington on jan 20 china's vice-chairman for tibet sun qi wen dismissed concerns that the karmapa's departure might hurt chinese relations with india
the dalai lama has met the karmapa five times since the teen-ager's arrival
coca-cola's targets for earnings growth may have to be lowered slightly but the president of the world's largest soft-drink maker also told wall street on friday that he is optimistic about prospects for the company
douglas daft who has been designated to become chairman and chief executive of atlanta-based coke and two top lieutenants outlined their vision for the company during a nearly two-hour presentation to securities analysts in new york
the meeting came just two days after coca-cola announced plans to eliminate 6000 jobs or one-fifth of the worldwide work force the sweeping reorganization also will give local managers more authority over how best to sell soft drinks
we have put our business much closer to where the business actually takes place daft said friday
coca-cola had an especially tough year in 1999 it recalled soft drinks in several european countries after a health scare its bid for the french soft drink brand orangina was blocked it was forced to scale back plans to buy several cadbury schweppes brands overseas and its sales in asia and latin america suffered because of regional economic turmoil
coke also faces a suit in which several former employees claimed they were denied promotions because of racial discrimination
douglas ivester unexpectedly announced in december that he would step down in april after about 2 1/2 years as chairman and chief executive daft was designated to succeed him in those posts and was named president in the interim
daft said the company is reviewing whether it needs to change its annual growth targets of 15 percent to 20 percent in earnings per share in the wake of this week's restructuring and has not yet completed the analysis
but he told the analysts on friday that the 17 percent to 18 percent average implied by the current estimated growth range is a tad high
he said the new average if there is one won't be below the mid-teens
marc cohen beverage analyst for goldman sachs &amp co said daft's comments may have allayed concerns that it will move down more
coca-cola shares fell $256 1/4 to $5693 3/4 in trading at 515 pm on the new york stock exchange it has fallen more than 13 percent from its closing level of $6587 1/2 a share on tuesday the day before the restructuring announcement
daft also said he expects 5 percent to 6 percent growth in coca-cola's sales volume of soft-drink concentrate to bottlers slightly below the target of 7 percent to 8 percent growth
that in part reflects the company's decision to reduce the soft-drink inventories held by its independent bottlers to free money that they can use to improve operations
the inventory reduction will mean coca-cola will sell less concentrate to its bottlers this year
we have a vested interest in having our bottlers be successful said james chestnut an executive vice president whose responsibilities include finance
daft said he didn't want to estimate what volume growth would be beyond the year 2000
but at another point in a question-and-answer session he told the analysts i'm very optimistic about the growth rates
emanuel goldman who follows coca-cola for merrill lynch said he was encouraged by the presentation about the daft team's candor in discussing its plans
they have a great sense of the business they will be disciplined and flexible they will be thoughtful but they won't be shy he said
long-term bond prices rose sharply for a third day in a row friday as investors sought refuge in fixed-income securities during a major selloff in the us stock markets
meanwhile shorter-term treasuries fell amid growing expectations the federal reserve will raise interest rates next week to slow the economy and fight inflation
the price of the 30-year note climbed 7/8 point or $875 per $1000 in face value its yield which moves in the opposite direction fell to 645 percent down from 652 percent at the same time on thursday
but prices of short-term treasury securities fell 1/16 to 1/32 point while intermediate maturities rose 1/32 to 9/32 point reported bridge telerate
the divergence between long and short-term bonds has been a running theme in the treasury markets for over a week
bond prices initially slumped friday on the release of more strong economic news which heightened fears that interest rates are headed higher
but interest rate concerns quickly gave way to a desire for a safe haven as stocks plunged the dow jones industrial average shed 289 points while the technology heavy nasdaq composite index was down 152
investors often shift money to government bonds when stocks tumble because bond returns while generally smaller than those from stock investments are guaranteed
in other trading thursday yields on three-month treasury bills were 562 percent as the discount rose 003 percentage point from thursday to 546 percent six-month yields were 584 percent as the discount rose 005 percentage point to 559 percent one-year yields were 617 percent as the discount rose 003 percentage point to 583 percent
yields are the interest bonds pay by maturity while the discount is the interest at which they are sold
the federal funds rate the interest on overnight loans between banks fell to 556 percent from thursday's 563 percent
the bond buyer index for municipal bonds rose 1/16 to 91 11/32 point the yield was 630 percent down from 631 percent late thursday
a cancer drug appears to ease advanced multiple sclerosis government scientists decided friday - leaving novantrone in line to become the nation's first treatment for tens of thousands of americans with crippling late-stage ms
but novantrone can be used only for about two years before it suddenly and mysteriously increases patients' risk of dangerous heart damage and ms is a disease patients battle for decades
so using novantrone safely quitting the drug around that two-year mark will require intense patient and doctor education members of a food and drug administration advisory committee warned
the fda is not bound by its advisers' recommendations but usually follows them if approved novantrone would become the first official treatment for secondary progressive ms the most severe form of the debilitating neurologic disease
about 350000 americans have ms which starts with such symptoms as numbness tingling and fatigue but progresses to difficulty walking and seeing and eventually paralysis it usually strikes people ages 20 to 40
ms tends to come in sporadic attacks or flares some patients have relapsing-remitting ms periods of severe symptoms after which patients almost totally recover until the next attack but 40 percent of ms patients have the worse secondary progressive form where the flares become more and more frequent and they don't recover from the damage each one causes
three drugs are in use that can somewhat ease relapsing-remitting ms but until now no drug has been proved to work against the more severe form said dr craig smith of seattle's swedish medical center
ms occurs when patients' immune systems go awry and attack the fatty layer of insulation called myelin that protects nerve fibers in the brain and spine thus damaging or even destroying nerves
novantrone a cancer drug made by seattle-based immunex corp works against ms by suppressing those attacking immune cells
in a two-year study of 194 europeans with advanced ms high doses of the drug slowed the disease's progression by 65 percent
novantrone causes side effects typical of cancer chemotherapy - some nausea hair loss menstrual disorders certain infections
but the main worry is that after patients take a certain amount of the drug - the amount most would get over a two-year period - they become at risk for heart failure doctors don't really understand why
if this drug is approved it's only going to be a short-term drug and there will be risks associated with it cautioned dr stephen reingold of the national multiple sclerosis society
it may prove difficult to get ms patients who feel healthy when taking novantrone to give it up for fear of the heart problem thus fda's advisers urged the agency to make the danger very clear and consider ways for doctors to measure accurately when ms patient are becoming at risk so they stop the drug
novantrone currently is sold to treat certain leukemia and prostate cancer patients that means regardless of whether fda formally approves it for ms doctors today can legally prescribe the drug to ms patients some are doing so
frankly i don't have anything else to use said smith who began prescribing novantrone after learning of the european study
smith's patient catherine sykes has been on novantrone for a year after older ms drugs did nothing to stop the flares that struck every few months
i have not had one exacerbation since i've been on the chemotherapy she said and her only side effect is a little nausea i've noticed improvements in my walking i have less fatigue and better muscle control
novantrone is given intravenously once every three months costing $2800 to $3000 for a year's treatment
international specialty products inc is launching a hostile takeover bid for dexter corp the nation's oldest publicly traded company after a previous bid worth nearly $1 billion was spurned
isp said friday it plans to nominate 10 board members who are committed to considering and pursuing isp's offer or a superior proposal when dexter has its annual meeting in april
dexter a specialty chemicals company last month rejected a $45-per-share offer from isp which is headed by wealthy investor samuel j heyman the dexter board called the isp proposal too low
heyman said in a letter to dexter officials that once he had control of the board he intended to allow isp's $932 million offer to be considered directly by dexter shareholders
the windsor locks-based dexter said it was reviewing heyman's letter and would respond in due course
isp of wayne nj also said it filed a federal lawsuit in connecticut on thursday seeking to overturn dexter's poison pill takeover defense that makes it harder for a bid to succeed and validate its proposed board vote
founded in 1767 as a cloth mill dexter was one of the nation's first conglomerates by the 1830s it makes products for the aerospace electronics food packaging and medical markets it is the oldest company publicly traded on the new york stock exchange
heyman who owns 75 percent of isp and about 10 percent of dexter has been critical of dexter's takeover of life technologies inc of rockville md
dexter holds 71 percent of life technologies heyman owns most of the rest of the company he has said he believes dexter and life technologies would be better off apart
isp makes chemicals mineral products and filters life technologies makes supplies for biological research and genetic engineering
in his letter to dexter chairman k grahame walker heyman said the 10 percent decline in dexter's stock price since it rejected isp's offer shows dexter's own shareholders appear to have rejected its business strategy as well
under heyman's proposal dexter shareholders would replace the three current board members up for re-election in april and add seven others enlarging the board to 17
on friday dexter stock fell 31 1/4 cents to $3787 1/2 in trading at 515 pm on the new york stock exchange isp stock also traded on the nyse fell 31 1/4 cents to $743 3/4
life technologies stock rose $388 to $53 per share in trading at 4 pm over the counter
stocks staged a sharp decline friday as fresh inflation news sparked a wave of sell cries on wall street with banks manufacturing and technology companies bearing the brunt of the bad news
the dow jones industrial average tumbled 28915 points or by 26 percent to 1073887 led lower by general electric general motors and jp morgan that selling spree brought the week's loss to 51284 points and left the dow at its lowest level since nov 11
an underlying worry of many investors is expectations that the federal reserve will raise interest rates when it meets next week and again later in the year curbing business expansion by making it more expensive to borrow money
the nasdaq composite index swooned 15249 points or by 38 percent to 388707 its second-biggest point drop ever as investors dumped shares of the usual favorites like qualcomm intel and oracle the nasdaq which ended last week at a record high lost 34833 points since then
a broad blue-chip barometer the standard &amp poor's 500 fell 3840 to 136016
before the session began the government released two reports that reinforced expectations that fed policy-makers will intensify their battle against inflation next week by raising interest rates to slow the us economy
with that news this morning buyers just walked away and will wait for the fed said barry berman head trader for robert w baird &amp co the market will be weak looking for direction until everybody knows what the fed is doing
the commerce department reported that the economy grew at a sizzling 58 percent annual rate during the final three months of 1999 well above the 51 percent forecast by many analysts and the strongest growth since a 59 percent rate posted in the last three months of 1998
separately the labor department said its employment cost index closely watched by fed chairman alan greenspan rose 11 percent in the fourth quarter or more than the 09 percent increase many analysts were expecting employment costs typically account for two-thirds of a product's price
those reports compound other recent signs that the economy continues to chug along despite three increases in lending rates by the fed since june the central bank's inflation-fighters meet again on tuesday and wednesday but more pivotal to the market than the expected rate boost may be the accompanying statement on the fed's stance going forward
consequently interest-rate sensitive bank stocks took a beating friday jp morgan fell 7 9/16 to 118 1/16 chase manhattan bank slid 4 to 76 11/16 and citigroup fell 2 7/8 to 56 1/8
industrial companies which are especially vulnerable to economic cycles and higher oil prices also saw their shares fall general electric slid 7 3/4 to 134 and general motors closed down 3 7/8 at 79
the selloff was exacerbated by investors who are buying more stocks with borrowed money worried about signals from technology favorites
amazoncom for example said friday it will fire 150 people to cut costs and earlier this week qualcomm said demand for its products was slowing
amazoncom's stock fell 5 1/4 to 61 11/16 on friday while qualcomm's shares slid 9 7/16 to 110 9/16
even technology stalwarts did not escape the selling spree like intel down 4 1/8 to 94 and oracle down 4 7/16 to 47 3/8
everytime interest rates go up companies with high price-to-earnings ratios go down the most and technology stocks have the highest ratios said ron hill a partner at brown brothers harriman
one bright spot in the market was the pharmaceutical companies such as merck up 2 1/4 to 76 3/8 and johnson &amp johnson up 4 at 84 1/2
but biotechnology companies were not as lucky biogen plunged 7 11/16 to 92
the russell 2000 index of smaller companies which has been on a tear fell 1240 to 50462
on the new york stock exchange declining issues outnumbered advancers by more than 2-to-1
nyse volume totaled 1076 billion shares vs 1115 billion in the previous session
overseas japan's nikkei stock average rose 117 percent germany's dax index fell 084 percent britain's ft-se 100 fell 102 percent and france's cac-40 rose 075 percent
for the first time in more than three years michael francis gov christie whitman's former head fund-raiser and sports chief is out from under the cloud of a criminal investigation
attorney general john j farmer jr said friday that he will not pursue the remaining two counts of a 12-count indictment charging francis with trying to force an atlantic city shopping center to hire his cleaning business
a judge had previously thrown out the other 10 counts because the state's case against francis was weak
state prosecutors had said francis the head fund-raiser for whitman's successful 1993 gubernatorial campaign threatened the ocean one mall with labor unrest if it did not award his planned building services a $500000 cleaning contract
the defense said there was no evidence that francis did anything other than promote his company his statements that there would be no labor problems were meant to reassure the mall owners not threaten or pressure them the defense said
farmer said it was in the best interest of the state not to proceed with the two remaining charges - tampering with witnesses and falsifying records
i made the decision in light of the court's prior rulings dismissing eight out of 12 counts of the indictment sharply limiting the evidence that the jury was allowed to hear and directing a verdict of acquittal on two further counts farmer said in a statement
francis whom whitman forced out as chairman of the new jersey sports and exposition authority said in a statement that farmer's decision ends what has been a devastating and painful period in my life
today's conclusion therefore is a bittersweet moment it seals my vindication and establishes my innocence but it also marks the loss of so much time and opportunity
the governor was in switzerland on friday for a conference her spokesman peter mcdonough said the governor would not second-guess former attorney general peter verniero's decision to indict francis
no governor is privy to what goes into a decision to pursue a criminal case we are under a presumption that the attorney general received the best professional advice to pursue a case he said
libyan leader moammar gadhafi threw out his parliament's proposed 2000 budget friday and criticized lawmakers for allocating too much money to administration rather than development
gadhafi told the general people's congress that he was shocked and dismayed that legislators had earmarked all of libya's oil revenue to the administration egypt's middle east news agency reported from the libyan capital of tripoli
gadhafi said that when he came to power in 1969 it was decided that 70 percent of oil revenue would be assigned to new development projects and 30 percent would be spent on government and public services the agency reported
libya rarely releases budget figures and it was unknown to what extent it has stuck to those 70-30 figures however more than 90 percent of government expenditure is usually financed from oil revenue libya produces 13 million barrels a day and 75 percent of production is for export
what happened is that today 100 percent of the oil revenues are devoted to the administration the agency reported him saying
such a policy squanders away the future and is a great treason we cannot permit gadhafi said libya has to spend its revenues on everything that will allow the country to advance he told the parliament which was convened in the coastal city of sirte
gadhafi told legislators to draw up a new budget allocating the bulk of funds to infrastructure he mentioned the construction of roads ports and airports industrial and agricultural projects health and education
officially libya is run by a series of people's congresses and committees but real power rests with gadhafi who ousted the former king in a military coup only one political party is permitted
palestinian leaders on friday accused israel of wasting time in peace talks saying prime minister ehud barak is not serious about meeting a feb 13 deadline for an outline of a final peace treaty between the two sides
barak on friday canceled a weekend trip to an economic conference in davos switzerland that move dashed hopes for a three-way summit with palestinian leader yasser arafat and president clinton who both were to be in attendance and planned to meet
i think barak doesn't want to reach an agreement with us said palestinian planning minister nabil shaath all he wants to do is to waste time
israeli-palestinian peace treaty talks have yielded little progress with the deadline for a treaty outline fast approaching israeli negotiator oded eran and his palestinian counterpart yasser abed rabbo are to hold talks starting sunday
a palestinian official speaking on condition of anonymity said it was possible the talks would be moved to the israeli red sea resort of eilat by midweek the official said a final decision on the venue has not yet been made
at a meeting of the palestinian cabinet friday evening arafat said israel's delaying and evading implementation of the interim agreements is harming the peace process very badly the palestinian news agency wafa said in a news release
the palestinians had proposed moving the talks to washington but israel refused shaath said
we want our negotiations with the israelis to be under the supervision of the united states the same as the negotiations between syria and israel he said
barak's spokesman gadi baltiansky said earlier friday that negotiations would intensify next week but both sides have said they doubt the february deadline for an outline can be met
the sides have set september as the deadline for a final treaty difficult issues are on the agenda including borders palestinian refugees jewish settlements and the fate of jerusalem which both claim
bowing to pressure from religious broadcasters and republican lawmakers the federal communications commission on friday reversed its ruling that some religious programming including church services cannot be considered educational
the fcc's original action though affecting only a limited number of religious broadcasters had prompted complaints that regulators were trying to control the content of religious tv a lawmaker introduced legislation this week that would have undone the fcc's order
on friday the commissioners in a 4-1 vote undid it themselves
regrettably it has become clear that our actions have created less certainty rather than more contrary to our intent the commission said
the controversy stemmed from an fcc decision in december that offered additional guidance for noncommercial broadcasters who seek licenses for specially reserved educational tv channels to qualify for such licenses the commission said that broadcasters must devote 50 percent of their regularly scheduled air time to educational programs
the commission determined that programming primarily devoted to religious exhortation proselytizing or statements of personally held religious views and beliefs generally would not qualify as general educational programming in a footnote it said church services also normally would not qualify as general educational programming
that language drew fire from hundreds of religious broadcasters and a number of republican lawmakers
on friday rep michael oxley r-ohio who had proposed the bill to repeal the fcc's action said he was thrilled by the reversal
religious broadcasters and their listeners were a target for an fcc that sought to limit their freedom to express religious faith oxley said
the national religious broadcasters declared the decision a total victory but spokesman karl stoll said the group would maintain a vigilant eye on the commission to prevent reprisals
fcc chairman bill kennard had tried to calm the furor by stressing that the ruling did not apply to the majority of religious broadcasters who operate on commercial channels about 373 television stations hold educational reserve licenses nationwide but about only 20 of these are religious broadcasters according to fcc estimates
even those who wanted special educational licenses would still only have to meet the requirement that 50 percent of their programming be educational kennard noted in letters to lawmakers
but the fcc acknowledged friday the difficulty of minting clear definitional parameters for educational instructional or cultural programming
commissioner michael powell who had dissented from the original decision to issue the guidance in december said it has opened a pandora's box of problems he supported the fcc's friday action to return the judgment back to broadcasters
but commissioner gloria tristani accused the fcc of caving in to an organized campaign of distortion and demagoguery she particularly took issue with critics who suggested that the commission had an anti-religious bias
i reject and resent this type of attack reminiscent of a witch hunt tristani wrote in her dissenting opinion
jerry starr co-chairman of the grassroots save pittsburgh public tv campaign said he was dismayed by the fcc's reversal
we're stunned by the sudden and last-minute capitulation said starr who had organized an effort among groups that included the national education association to defend the guidelines

a pitifully thin girl was the first to emerge from the airplane carried down the stairs and placed gently in a wheelchair struggling behind her on crutches was a boy with only one leg
by the time the plane was empty 19 sick and weak-looking adolescents were back in their homeland of uganda after being released from months - or possibly years - of captivity under ugandan rebels based in southern sudan
since last month about 60 child captives have been handed over by uganda's feared lord's resistance army rebels to their sometime military backers sudan's government in turn sudan has allowed aid workers to return the young people to uganda as part of a deal to improve relations between the two countries
they are the lucky ones
of the thousands of children believed to have been systematically kidnapped by the rebels over the past decade at least 5000 remain missing - 2000 of whom are believed to be alive a united nations childrens' fund official said
boys serve as porters and fighters to the rebels - who are led by former soldiers and other northerners disgruntled with uganda's government girls are often forced to be concubines of rebel commanders
one of the freed children who arrived friday in entebbe near uganda's capital of kampala was a girl holding a five-month-old baby at her breast officials said the tiny child had been fathered by one of the lra commanders whom she was forced to marry
the one-legged boy cried for days saying he wanted to go home said afaf yahya another unicef official
although dressed in new shoes and clothes the children showed little emotion for a welcoming ceremony after the flight
the mood is rather sad but i am happy that my children are back it is a positive indication that sudan is willing to honor the agreement signed here with the uganda government said uganda's vice-president specioza kazibwe who presided over the ceremony
the children are held against their will and their identification repatriation and resettlement is a gigantic task she said drawing cheers from an otherwise somber audience when she put a child on her back then held another in her lap
no one has said how the sudanese government arranges to receive the children from the lra which it had been arming and it remained unclear how many more children will be released
unicef officials said the 19 children will be flown saturday to the northern town of gulu to receive medical treatment counseling and to be handed over to relatives
the lra is one of several rebel organizations from northern and northwestern uganda that have attempted to oust president yoweri museveni himself a former rebel leader who took power in 1986 sudan has also accused uganda of backing southern sudanese rebels
the thruway authority board has quietly approved a 3 percent toll hike beginning june 1 to pay for improvements to the superhighway and other transportation projects
the board thursday voted to go forward with a previously unannounced plan to tie future toll increases on the thruway to the construction cost index which is an average of construction material and labor costs the first-year hike will be 3 percent the maximum annual increase under the new toll increase system
tolls at the short-trip barriers around buffalo and new york city would not go up because they are rounded to the nearest quarter but virtually all other tolls on the ticketed part of the superhighway would go up by 3 percent rounded to the nearest nickel
thruway officials will hold four public hearings to gather comment on the toll-increase plan and finalize the plan this spring thruway spokeswoman anya frost said
however the authority's executive director john platt insisted no final decision had been made they're holding public hearings in april and they could change their minds he said
tolls were last raised on the thruway the nation's longest toll road in 1988 in 1996 the thruway board backed away from a toll hike at the insistence of gov george pataki
there was little if any advance word that the board was contemplating a toll hike before thursday's meeting the press release issued by the authority afterward spoke of the agency funding $275 million in capital improvements this year not until the second page of the release did the authority refer to the adoption of a plan which could result in an annual toll hike - it called it an indexed toll adjustment plan - beginning june 1
this common-sense plan will ensure that motorists are never hit with massive toll hikes while providing businesses that rely on the thruway with the information they need when planning their budgets the authority said in a statement from chairman louis tomson
the majority leader of the state senate said friday he is opposed to raising tolls joseph bruno cited such a hike as running counter to recent state efforts to cut taxes and other costs of doing business in the state
now is not the time for the thruway authority to impose a hidden tax on upstate businesses residents and commuters in the form of multiyear toll hikes bruno r-rensselaer said
if the senate majority wants to make money available for capital projects we'll be more than happy to discuss this alternative platt said but otherwise we need to be able to have a hedge against the cost of construction
the state motor truck association blasted the authority for the secretive manner in which it voted to raise tolls and said it appeared there was nothing to prevent tolls from going up 3 percent every year if construction costs continue to rise annually
as business people we would never increase our prices to our largest customers without first consulting with them grumbled the motor truck association's president bill joyce
it called on pataki to ask the thruway authority to reexamine its projected toll hike and to find other ways to fund improvements on the roadway
pataki spokesman michael mckeon refused to take a stance on the plan at this point it's just a proposal he said there's going to be public hearings we'll let the process move forward
under the $275 million in projects to be put out for bid this year by the thruway was worked on the interstate 287 corridor around the tappan zee bridge and the syracuse inner harbor development project
both projects are among the transportation facilities the thruway has assumed authority for in recent years critics say the drain of these other facilities have put additional financial burdens on the authority past that of maintaining the original toll highway between new york city and the pennsylvania border
tomson was a former deputy to pataki and was nominated by the governor to the thruway position it is unlikely that the thruway authority board would proceed with a toll hike plan without the prior knowledge of pataki's office
stocks staged a sharp decline friday as fresh inflation news sparked a wave of sell cries on wall street with banks manufacturing and technology companies bearing the brunt of the bad news
the dow jones industrial average tumbled 28915 points or by 26 percent to 1073887 led lower by general electric general motors and jp morgan that selling spree brought the week's loss to 51284 points and left the dow at its lowest level since nov 11
an underlying worry of many investors is expectations that the federal reserve will raise interest rates when it meets next week and again later in the year curbing business expansion by making it more expensive to borrow money
the nasdaq composite index swooned 15249 points or by 38 percent to 388707 its second-biggest point drop ever as investors dumped shares of the usual favorites like qualcomm intel and oracle the nasdaq which ended last week at a record high lost 34833 points since then
a broad blue-chip barometer the standard &amp poor's 500 fell 3840 to 136016
before the session began the government released two reports that reinforced expectations that fed policy-makers will intensify their battle against inflation next week by raising interest rates to slow the us economy
with that news this morning buyers just walked away and will wait for the fed said barry berman head trader for robert w baird &amp co the market will be weak looking for direction until everybody knows what the fed is doing
the commerce department reported that the economy grew at a sizzling 58 percent annual rate during the final three months of 1999 well above the 51 percent forecast by many analysts and the strongest growth since a 59 percent rate posted in the last three months of 1998
separately the labor department said its employment cost index closely watched by fed chairman alan greenspan rose 11 percent in the fourth quarter or more than the 09 percent increase many analysts were expecting employment costs typically account for two-thirds of a product's price
those reports compound other recent signs that the economy continues to chug along despite three increases in lending rates by the fed since june the central bank's inflation-fighters meet again on tuesday and wednesday but more pivotal to the market than the expected rate boost may be the accompanying statement on the fed's stance going forward
consequently interest-rate sensitive bank stocks took a beating friday jp morgan fell 7 9/16 to 118 1/16 chase manhattan bank slid 4 to 76 11/16 and citigroup fell 2 7/8 to 56 1/8
industrial companies which are especially vulnerable to economic cycles and higher oil prices also saw their shares fall general electric slid 7 3/4 to 134 and general motors closed down 3 7/8 at 79
the selloff was exacerbated by investors who are buying more stocks with borrowed money worried about signals from technology favorites
amazoncom for example said friday it will fire 150 people to cut costs and earlier this week qualcomm said demand for its products was slowing
amazoncom's stock fell 5 1/4 to 61 11/16 on friday while qualcomm's shares slid 9 7/16 to 110 9/16
even technology stalwarts did not escape the selling spree like intel down 4 1/4 to 94 and oracle down 4 7/16 to 47 3/8
everytime interest rates go up companies with high price-to-earnings ratios go down the most and technology stocks have the highest ratios said ron hill a partner at brown brothers harriman
one bright spot in the market was the pharmaceutical companies such as merck up 2 1/4 to 76 3/8 and johnson &amp johnson up 4 at 84 1/2
but biotechnology companies were not as lucky biogen plunged 7 7/16 to 92 1/4

the united nations on friday warned of the potential for social unrest in east timor because of unemployment high food prices and disrupted social services in the aftermath of the territory's vote for independence
to try to counter the risk secretary-general kofi annan recommended that the un transitional administration in east timor or untaet make creating jobs and beefing up east timor's destroyed infrastructure a priority
the east timorese have received untaet with a great deal of goodwill and very high expectations as the embodiment of the international community's promise of support annan wrote in a report to the security council however they are in desperate straits and are understandably impatient for untaet to deliver on this promise
east timor's people voted overwhelmingly in a un-organized ballot on aug 30 to break away from indonesia which invaded the former portuguese colony in 1975 and annexed it a year later
indonesian-backed militias went on a weeks-long killing and looting rampage to protest the results destroying large parts of the territory and driving tens of thousands of east timorese into the neighboring indonesian-controlled territory of west timor
the united nations estimates there are still nearly 100000 people in refugee camps set up in west timor where pro-indonesian militias continue to operate allegedly harassing and intimidating the refugees
in his report annan said the un mission which has been running the territory for three months is trying to coordinate humanitarian relief efforts but he said the destruction of the territory particularly in public services would continue to be a serious obstacle to progress
widespread unemployment and the disruption of the education system and other social and public services combined with the very high prices of food and other daily necessities bear the potential for serious social problems he wrote
in addition to trying to create more jobs expanding trade will be an important step in lowering the prices of basic goods annan said
snacking on chocolate needn't be a guilt trip a candy maker assures consumers in a web site that suggests there may be health benefits to eating the treat
mars inc the hackettstown-based maker of m&ampm's snickers and 3 musketeers stops short of claiming chocolate is a health food but it is believed to be the first major chocolate manufacturer to promote research on the possible disease-fighting properties of the plant compounds found in the candy
everyone knows that chocolate tastes great most don't know that chocolate may provide certain health benefits the good news is eating well can include chocolate according to the web site wwwcocoaprocom
the site said preliminary research suggests that cocoa beans contain antioxidants called polyphenols which may reduce the risk of heart disease
the cocoapro logo - a graphic of a hand holding a cocoa bean - will appear on the back of candy bar wrappers beginning this quarter with the hopes that consumers will turn to the web site to ease their conscience
hershey foods corp and nestle usa both mars competitors are not promoting the health benefits of their products
laurie macdonald at nestle said however that her company finds the research interesting and promising and is following it closely
the chocolate manufacturers association has its own web site touting the health benefits of chocolate the site notes that research suggests eating a chocolate bar instead of a high carbohydrate snack raises good cholesterol levels
one researcher who has done several studies on chocolate's health properties said they show it does have some benefits
our work shows that chocolate does have antioxidant effects which could protect against heart disease premature aging and possibly cancer said penny kris-etherton a nutrition professor at penn state university
bruce silverglade legal director for the center for science in the public interest a nonprofit organization that advocates food safety and nutrition said friday that mars is using its web site to make assertions that the federal government has not yet approved for its packaging
this is irresponsible health advice said silverglade he warned that many candy bars contain a significant amount of saturated fats which have been proven to raise blood cholesterol levels and increase the risk of heart disease
the federal food and drug administration has not approved any health claims for chocolate any such claims on the candy wrapper would require fda authorization
marlene machut a spokeswoman for mars said the company is not suggesting replacing fruits and vegetables with a snickers bar
we support what nutritionists have been saying moderation and a balanced diet is the key to healthy living chocolate can certainly fit into a healthy diet and a healthy lifestyle she said people need to enjoy their food
sen john mccain battled friday to hold off gov george bush and gain the new hampshire triumph needed to sustain his underdog presidential campaign as the five-man republican field headed into a final weekend of campaigning before the nation's first primary
bush in a two-front fight against staunch conservative candidates on one side and the more moderate mccain on the other believed he was narrowing the gap aides said but they also said the texas governor might run out of time
there would have to be a sea change in voter attitudes for mccain to lose said ken khachigian one of the arizona senator's advisers
bush front-runner nationally said that win or lose in new hampshire on tuesday i will survive
the majority of public polls friday gave mccain the lead but they also offered bush reason to hope conservative steve forbes was running a distant third still taking aim at bush
four days before the nation's first primary the gop campaigns launched their get-out-the-vote drives and made final decisions on weekend tv ads unlike past years when negative ads were part of the closing-weekend dynamic the top-tier campaigns decided to keep their attack spots off the air unless a rival went first
though eleventh-hour attacks could still hit monday the reluctance to go negative suggested that mccain bush and forbes were focusing on turning out their supporters rather than trying to peel away their rivals' backers
absent any earth-shattering events this weekend it's all going to come down to turnout said bush spokesman ari fleischer
the texas governor said he had a very good chance of winning tuesday but whatever happens bush told reporters i'm in it for the long pull with a campaign well organized in primary states beyond new hampshire
mccain however can't afford to lose here his aides said with a fraction of bush's money and little support from the party establishment mccain's longshot strategy is to hobble bush in new hampshire and ride the momentum into later primary states
all i know is it's tight mccain said belying the upbeat mood of his senior staff both bush and mccain drew large crowds friday
steve duprey new hampshire's republican party chairman said mccain was the man to beat but he sensed bush gaining ground the bush people have to pour it on to catch john he said
mccain has been leading in most polls using his strength among independents while a couple of polls have shown the race very close tracking polls which are sometimes unreliable showed bush gaining ground on mccain after wednesday's debate by getting increasing support from republicans
bush meanwhile was being squeezed from the right and left while mccain kept him occupied conservative voters were flirting with forbes alan keyes and gary bauer
criticism was served with coffee at a manchester donut shop friday as bauer attacked bush's abortion stance
i believe governor bush is awol on this issue he said later he told employees at an investment firm in merrimack that others in his party were reluctant to take controversial stands on issues i think too many of the people in my party get up in the morning and head for the tall grass he said
speaking to a group of college students keyes' eyes welled up with tears when spoke of his religious faith
and forbes joined forces with mccain to sue for inclusion on new york primary ballots both candidates are accusing bush of trying to keep them off
forbes flew several current and former texas education officials to manchester to criticize bush's record as governor bush's rhetoric about his texas record is in direct contrast to what has actually happened the publisher said
bush replied as he usually does to forbes by recalling his rival's 1996 tv ads that damaged the campaign of eventual nominee bob dole
the people of new hampshire are going to reject that kind of campaigning bush said
turning to mccain the texan said president clinton's state of the union address showed that the president and mccain agree on the size of the tax cut
it's not significant enough bush said of the $350 billion 10-year tax cut proposed by clinton mccain is proposing a $237 billion in tax cuts over five years half the size of bush's plan
turning the tables mccain compared bush to clinton
george bush's tax plan is exactly the kind of empty promise we've had from president clinton the last eight years he said
already flush with endorsements bush picked up the backing of former new hampshire gov john sununu former vice presidential candidate jack kemp endorsed bush a day earlier
mccain said the back-to-back backings show real desperation among the establishment
behind the scenes mccain's campaign mailed promotional material to 95000 republican women and more than 100000 independent voters in addition 60000 veterans will be getting letters discussing the former vietnam pows one last mission
letters from bush's mother former first lady barbara bush were sent by the texan's campaign to tens of thousands of new hampshire residents each voter identified by the campaign as a bush backer will get four pieces of mail and four telephone calls urging them to vote tuesday
forbes' mailouts said that bush couldn't be trusted to cut taxes or government spending
the florida nun selected by attorney gen janet reno as a neutral party in the custody battle over elian gonzalez sought unsuccessfully on friday to persuade reno to change her mind about returning the 6-year-old to cuba sister jeanne o'laughlin also backed legislation to make elian an american citizen
conceding i am no longer neutral o'laughlin told reporters she has come to believe that separating elian now from his florida relatives would be another traumatic loss for him after the death of his mother at sea in november
her abandonment of impartiality was denounced by those seeking elian's return to his father
i am bewildered said rep maxine waters d-calif never in my wildest imagination would i think that a nun who was supposed to be a neutral party would undermine that neutrality
o'laughlin the barry university president whose miami beach home was used earlier in the week for a meeting between elian and his cuban grandmothers said she now thinks it is in the boy's best interest to stay in this country at least temporarily
but reno a longtime friend did not back away from her support of the immigration and naturalization service's ruling that the boy be returned to his father
she would only change her mind i believe if she could find legal reasons to change her mind and have adequate evidence that that would be necessary o'laughlin said outside the justice department
reno after escorting o'laughlin to the department door said in a written statement that she had listened to all she had to say she told me about her feelings observations and conclusions
however reno said i continue to believe based on all the information available to me including the information that sister jeanne shared with me that the person who speaks for this child is his one surviving parent - his father
despite the stark difference of opinion the two women remained friendly at the end of their meeting o'laughlin said i left my meeting with janet reno with a gigantic hug and a promise that we will both keep pursuing the truth as we see it
the ins ruling has not been carried out because the federal government agreed to postpone action until the family had an opportunity to challenge it in court which elian's florida relatives have done filing a lawsuit in miami
at a hearing friday in miami us district judge william hoeveler said he would hear arguments on feb 22 on whether the lawsuit should be dismissed on thursday the judge had set a hearing date of march 6
reno said she hoped the case would be resolved as quickly as possible
before meeting with reno o'laughlin visited sen connie mack r-fla chief sponsor of the citizenship bill and announced her support for it
the child has been in the torment of the seas and now he's been in the torment of political agendas somehow we must find for him calm seas at least for a while she said if it takes a congressional act to keep him here so be it she said
her support for the legislation came just as it appeared to be losing ground in congress elian's grandmothers made the rounds of capitol hill this week urging the boy's return to cuba
mack conceded that the grandmothers' visits had affected some of my colleagues costing potential support for his legislation but denied that o'laughlin's support for it would undermine her credibility or was intended on his part to counter the grandmothers' visits
we don't care about politics we care about our grandson said mariela quintana the paternal grandmother
the grandmothers might return to cuba this weekend said the rev joan brown campbell of the national council of churches which has facilitated their travel
the meeting in reno's office ran more than an hour and a half twice the scheduled length also present were ins commissioner doris meissner and peg albert a child psychologist and colleague of sister jeanne the ins is part of the justice department
elian has been the center of an international tug of war since he was found clinging to an inner tube nov 25 off the florida coast his mother and others traveling with him from cuba had drowned
a former miami-dade county commissioner who was caught on tape taking a $5000 bribe was sentenced friday to two years and three months in prison
james burke who declared this is a wonderful country after taking the money from an informant was convicted of bribery in october
i acted unwise and i don't blame anyone else burke said at the sentencing hearing
prosecutors said burke and his aide billy hardemon took kickbacks to steer millions of dollars in business to san francisco financier calvin grigsby a founder of what was once the nation's leading minority-owned municipal bond firm
hardemon and grigsby were acquitted
defense secretary william cohen said friday he remains optimistic that the pentagon can build a reliable national missile defense despite the failure of a missile interceptor test last week
the science is there to build a system of radars and interceptors that could defend all 50 states against a limited attack by long-range ballistic missiles cohen said in an interview in his pentagon office
cohen said the interceptor launched last week from kwajalein island in the central pacific missed its target - a mock warhead sent aloft by a minuteman missile from more than 4000 miles away - by less than 100 feet that was a more precise description of the outcome than pentagon officials had previously provided
the exact reason the intercept missed still is being sought cohen said
cohen said he still intends to give president clinton a recommendation this summer on whether to commit to deploying a national missile defense if the commitment is made the plan is to have it ready for use by 2005
the defense secretary said clinton will take into account the level of threat posed by countries such as north korea that are trying to build long-range ballistic missile forces
the threat is there and is likely to grow cohen said
on other topics cohen said
the russian army is now bogged down in its war in chechnya to the point where the outcome is uncertain whatever victory they might secure they certainly have to face a long-term type of guerrilla warfare he said
the 2001 defense budget to be submitted by president clinton on feb 7 will include about $60 billion in money to buy new weapons about $1 billion of that will be devoted to repairing shortcomings exposed in the kosovo war last spring including the purchase of an additional joint stars ground surveillance aircraft an additional squadron of navy ea-6b electronic warfare aircraft and more unmanned surveillance planes
he intends to ask congress again this year for authority to close more military bases he did not sound optimistic about the chances of persuading congress which has refused to grant such authority in each of the last three years can we achieve it this year i don't know he said he said he is consulting with senate majority leader trent lott r-miss about how to approach the problem this year
the pentagon's policy on gays in the military in which homosexuals are permitted to serve as long as they don't reveal their sexual orientation is generally being implemented effectively despite highly publicized lapses
a us postal service truck crashed and caught on fire after its driver swerved to avoid boulders from a landslide burning thousands of letters
postal workers will be able to salvage only about 10 percent of them and because the fire needed to be hosed down even the salvageable mail was soaked postal service spokesman david mazer said
the big rig mail truck which left the mojave mail processing center was bound for los angeles international airport early thursday the driver suffered minor injuries in the crash

president clinton took the agenda for his final year in office to small town america on friday saying strong economic times demand action on social security education inequality and other long-term challenges
the president asked the residents of quincy to remember how they banded together in 1993 when flood waters imperiled neighboring communities along the mississipppi river - and how their forefathers harbored slaves seeking freedom
when you have the chance of a lifetime to do good you cannot be lulled into complaceny clinton said his overcoat collar turned up against the frigid weather as he spoke in washington park site of the sixth lincoln-douglas debate the president urged an enthusiastic crowd of several thousand people to seize the challenge of a new era
we've got to understand that we're a strong country when we all work together and we give everyone a chance to rise he said
with republicans in control of congress and the november elections beginning to steal the political spotlight the prognosis for clinton's agenda is not rosy but at a white house breakfast with dozens of mayors earlier friday the president said saving the retirement system and improving schools are too important to be stymied by election-year politics
the further away you move from the grass roots the more likely politics is to shift from deeds to words he said asking the local leaders to join his cause you mayors can make a difference here
this town of 42202 named for john quincy adams - who served 17 years in congress after leaving the white house - welcomed clinton warmly the day after he delivered his last state of the union address
hundreds were on hand at baldwin field when the presidential plane arrived local television lingered on every handshake and positioned cameras along the motorcade route to broadcast his arrival live
twenty local heroes from law enforcement officers to teachers and businessmen were seated on the platform as clinton spoke in washington park
quincy is home to farmers and manufacturers a century ago it provided safe haven to escaped slaves who made it across the mississippi river and victims of religious persecution in 1993 the community served as a staging area for relief efforts when flooding overwhelmed nearby towns
clinton chose to visit quincy aides said because it symbolized communities large and small across the country that have prospered during his administration crime and unemployment have reached historic lows over the past seven years
across the politically important state of illinois unemployment has declined 3 percentage points since clinton took office in 1993 more than 35000 children have entered the head start program and crime is down 9 percent
the president repeated his call for investing more in education - from head start to college tuition assistance shoring up social security while paying down the $36 trillion public debt and spurring investment in areas that have yet to share in the recent economic prosperity
we can bring free enterprise and hope to people who have never had it he said
in a nod to the farmland surrounding quincy clinton also called anew for overhaul of federal assistance to farmers
we should be using this time wisely to deal with the long-term challenges clinton said that's what i want the american people to support
heading into a final frantic weekend of campaigning in new hampshire republican john mccain sought to hold off george w bush for a primary victory to keep his underdog presidential campaign alive
bush in a two-front fight against staunch conservative candidates on one side and the more moderate mccain on the other believed he was narrowing the gap aides said friday but they also said they feared their boss might run out of time
there would have to be a sea change in voter attitudes for mccain to lose said ken khachigian one of the arizona senator's advisers
the majority of public polls friday gave mccain the lead but they also offered bush reason to hope conservative steve forbes was running a distant third still taking aim at bush
four days before the nation's first primary the gop campaigns launched their get-out-the-vote drives and made final decisions on weekend tv ads unlike past years when negative ads were part of the closing-weekend dynamic the top-tier campaigns decided to keep their attack spots off the air unless a rival went first
though eleventh-hour attacks could still hit monday the reluctance to go negative suggested that mccain bush and forbes were focusing on turning out their supporters rather than trying to peel away their rivals' backers
absent any earth-shattering events this weekend it's all going to come down to turnout said bush spokesman ari fleischer
the texas governor said he had a very good chance of winning tuesday but whatever happens bush told reporters i'm in it for the long pull with a campaign well organized in primary states beyond new hampshire
i will survive he said
mccain however can't afford to lose here his aides said with a fraction of bush's money and little support from the party establishment mccain's longshot strategy is to hobble bush in new hampshire and ride the momentum into later primary states
all i know is it's tight mccain said belying the upbeat mood of his senior staff both bush and mccain drew large crowds friday
steve duprey new hampshire's republican party chairman said mccain was the man to beat but he sensed bush gaining ground the bush people have to pour it on to catch john he said
mccain has been leading in most polls using his strength among independents while a couple of polls have shown the race very close tracking polls which are sometimes unreliable showed bush gaining ground on mccain after wednesday's debate by getting increasing support from republicans
bush meanwhile was being squeezed from the right and left while mccain kept him occupied conservative voters were flirting with forbes alan keyes and gary bauer
criticism was served with coffee at a manchester donut shop friday as bauer attacked bush's abortion stance
i believe governor bush is awol on this issue he said
speaking to a group of college students keyes' eyes welled up with tears when he spoke of his religious faith
and forbes joined forces with mccain to sue for inclusion on new york primary ballots both candidates are accusing bush of trying to keep them off
forbes flew several current and former texas education officials to manchester to criticize bush's record as governor bush's rhetoric about his texas record is in direct contrast to what has actually happened the new jersey publisher said
bush replied as he usually does to forbes by recalling his rival's 1996 tv ads that damaged the campaign of eventual nominee bob dole
the people of new hampshire are going to reject that kind of campaigning bush said
turning to mccain the texan said president clinton's state of the union address showed that the president and mccain agree on the size of the tax cut	 it's not significant enough bush said of the $350 billion 10-year tax cut proposed by clinton mccain is proposing $237 billion in tax cuts over five years half the size of bush's plan
turning the tables mccain compared bush to clinton
george bush's tax plan is exactly the kind of empty promise we've had from president clinton the last eight years he said
already flush with endorsements bush picked up the backing of former new hampshire gov john sununu former vice presidential candidate jack kemp endorsed bush a day earlier
mccain said the back-to-back backings show real desperation among the establishment
behind the scenes mccain's campaign mailed promotional material to 95000 republican women and more than 100000 independent voters in addition 60000 veterans will be getting letters discussing the former vietnam pows one last mission
letters from bush's mother former first lady barbara bush were sent by the texan's campaign to tens of thousands of new hampshire residents each voter identified by the campaign as a bush backer will get four pieces of mail and four telephone calls urging them to vote tuesday
forbes' mailouts said that bush couldn't be trusted to cut taxes or government spending
a gay pride week that comes smack in the middle of the roman catholic holy year has irked the vatican but rome's mayor insisted friday that the event will be allowed to take place
you might not go along with the gay pride event but it would be a mistake to ban it mayor francesco rutelli said
world pride roma 2000 is expected to bring hundreds of thousands of gays and lesbians to rome at the same time the city is overflowing with religious pilgrims coming to the jubilee millennium celebrations called by pope john paul ii
rome has a millennium-old code of welcome and respect that won't change in 2000 rutelli told a city council meeting on holy year issues friday as about 20 demonstrators gathered outside to protest world pride
the vatican which condemns homosexual acts but not homosexuality itself had no official comment on the july 1-9 event vatican officials denied reports that the holy see had tried to get it canceled
but the officials who spoke on condition of anonymity also acknowledged that the vatican was irritated by the fact that the gathering comes during the jubilee year
early saturday italian rai state radio quoted cardinal angelo sodano the pope's secretary of state as saying during a reception friday evening that the vatican expects from the premier a gesture of common sense an apparent call for the italian government to intervene to cancel the gay event
sodano also was quoted as saying the controversy puts into question the concordat a document regulating relations between rome and the vatican that was first signed in 1929 and was revised in the 1980s
a pro-vatican member of parliament mario baccini called the mayor's decision a moral and material slap in the face of the holy see
vatican officials said the holy see was displeased by the city's cooperation with the organizers including allocation of $180000 to cover municipal costs like security
rutelli has been a big jubilee booster shepherding the city through major construction projects - including a vatican garage - to spruce it up for an estimated 30 million pilgrims
the vatican's holy year calendar includes days dedicated to the sick to children and to city traffic officers the pope's fellow poles get their day during the first week in july - the same time as world pride
gays have criticized the pope's teachings on homosexuality but italian gay leaders denied any disrespect is intended by holding world pride during the jubilee
it's not an anti-jubilee event nor an event against the pope said francesco falsetta an official of the mario mieli homosexual cultural association one of the organizing groups
world pride's main event will be a july 8 march through the city organizers say it will also feature conferences sporting events and parties
firefighters were attempting to extinguish a landfill fire friday on the us virgin island of st croix
the fire at the landfill sent up a plume of smoke over the area but did not affect flights at the nearby airport said public workers commissioner harold thompson authorities did not know what caused the fire nor when it would be contained
landfill fires are not uncommon at the us virgin islands' two landfills the other located on st thomas island in june an explosion caused by a fuel tank at the st croix landfill threw up a 2000-foot-high mushroom cloud and ignited a fire that burned for several days
the federal aviation administration has ordered the local government to shut down the st croix landfill by december 2002 because it attracts birds which could cause a danger to planes using the nearby airport port authority executive director gordon finch said
a woman with multiple sclerosis was convicted of drug possession on friday for lighting a marijuana cigarette in a congressman's capitol hill office when she felt the onset of an attack related to her illness
judge stephanie duncan-peters of the district of columbia superior court ruled in a nonjury trial that the woman renee emry wolfe 39 of ann arbor mich had not met the burden of proof necessary for a medical defense
she could have sentenced the mother of four to six months in jail and fined her $1000 but instead ordered wolfe to perform 50 hours of community service and pay court costs of $50
i would prefer that wolfe return to her home and deal with her medical condition in whatever way she and her doctor deem appropriate duncan-peters said
marijuana is banned by the federal government although voters in six states have approved laws allowing the drug to be used for medical purposes nearly 70 percent of voters in washington dc voted last year to allow the medical use of marijuana but congress has blocked the measure from becoming law
wolfe went to rep bill mccollum's office on sept 15 1998 carrying the marijuana and a sign to protest his resolution saying marijuana is a dangerous drug that should not be legalized for medical use
defense lawyer jeffrey orchard said wolfe intended to simply tell the congressman about her experience with marijuana but started to feel tense she lighted the marijuana cigarette only when she believed she was about to suffer an attack of shaking and muscle tightening caused by her condition he said
a neurologist dr denis petro testified that marijuana works as a muscle relaxant allowing people with multiple sclerosis to control their shaking or spasticity other drugs produce severe side effects or are not as effective he said
prosecutor alex bourelly acknowledged this is a unique case and a unique defense but said it was clear wolfe was guilty of marijuana possession under the law in washington
the judge said the case comes down to whether there was a necessity for wolfe to possess marijuana on that day in the district of columbia
there isn't any evidence she was suffering an attack of spasticity at the time she was in the congressman's office duncan-peters concluded
multiple sclerosis is a disease of the central nervous system that afflicts more than 300000 americans wolfe has difficulty walking and usually sits in a wheelchair
a fairly strong earthquake with a preliminary magnitude of 68 shook northern japan but there were no reports of damage or injuries
the quake which hit friday night around 1121 pm was centered about 35 miles under the floor of the pacific ocean off the eastern coast of japan's northern island of hokkaido the meteorological agency said
it was felt most strongly in the cities of kushiro and nemuro and the towns of nakashibetsu akkeshi and betsukai in hokkaido people in the northern region of honshu japan's main island also felt the quake
there was no fear of tsunami or seismic waves caused by undersea disturbances such as volcanic activity or undersea earthquakes
a quake of magnitude 6 can cause damage to houses if it is centered in a residential area
japan is one of the world's most earthquake-prone countries it sits atop four tectonic plates slabs of land that move across the earth's surface
a couple who say their son has brittle bone disease and fled when authorities contended they beat him have returned to minnesota and worked out a deal with prosecutors ending nine months on the run
wally hines iii 31 and his wife debby 32 came back with their 18-month-old son wyatt on wednesday and appeared in court friday they were released without bail and allowed to keep custody of their child
the criminal charges will be dismissed oct 30 if the parents stay out of trouble with the law continue to cooperate with authorities on care for the child and if the boy remains in good health dakota county attorney james backstrom said the agreement includes continued involvement by social service workers and juvenile court supervision
they're very happy they wanted to come home said john whitehead president of the rutherford institute a charlottesville va-based legal advocacy group that helped negotiate their return
i think they feel that things have worked out about as well as could be expected said wally hines jr wyatt's grandfather i didn't think they would have come back otherwise to tell you the truth
a spokeswoman for the county attorney's office diane anderson said officials couldn't give further details because all parties in the case remain under a judge's gag order
the hineses and their defenders have always denied that wyatt was the victim of abuse and maintained that authorities overreacted to his injuries the parents were never charged with child abuse only with depriving the county of its custodial rights and federal charges of interstate flight to avoid prosecution the federal charges are being dropped
the family says wyatt suffers from osteogenesis imperfecta a genetic disease that affects some 20000 to 50000 americans or about 1 in 20000 they say that's what explains the broken leg and broken ribs that first brought wyatt to authorities' attention
because of the gag order it was unclear if prosecutors were still disputing the diagnosis they had suggested earlier that the boy's fractures might have been caused by roughhousing by his father
officials with the osteogenesis imperfecta foundation in gaithersburg md say it's common for social workers to conclude that children are victims of abuse when they're really victims of oi and that the condition can be difficult to diagnose
wyatt's problems were first noticed when he was just 6 weeks old and his parents took him to a doctor with a swollen leg x-rays showed that his femur was broken in two places when child protection workers ordered more x-rays doctors found six broken ribs and wyatt was put in foster care for three months where he suffered more fractures
the couple got wyatt back when they agreed to a deal that required the father to live away from their home for four weeks shortly before a final hearing in may wyatt's femur broke again and they fled april 27 after learning police were coming to take wyatt away
one by one all 599 graduates walked up the aisle of the gymnasium of the richard stockton college of new jersey on friday one by one they engaged in the familiar graduation ceremony routine a handshake a diploma a posed photograph
nearly everyone got some applause from classmates or family members but the whole crowd roared for tony skladanek or was it amelia they were cheering for
skladanek 33 of northfield and amelia - his seeing eye dog - walked up the ramp near the dais as the applause grew louder skladanek was handed his psychology degree then shook hands with carole hedinger a member of the college's board of trustees before heading down the ramp and back to his seat
it was a graduation for me and a retirement party for her skladanek said later
the german shepherd which is 11 years old is gradually going blind skladanek will soon replace her but she'll only be losing a job - not a friend
she'll stay right here and live in the lap of luxury with my family i'll be getting my own apartment in atlantic city he said
skladanek a former casino waiter lost his sight 12 years ago as a result of complications stemming from diabetes a graduate of atlantic community college he went on to earn a 338 grade-point average at stockton where he relied on braille and student note-takers to help him work
but his peers learned plenty from him too
a lot of people when they're having a hard time at school and they think they can't do it they look at me i give 'em a boost they think if he can do it i can do it' i seem to encourage people even before i ever open my mouth he said
they were certainly encouraged friday when skladanek and amelia - both wearing caps and gowns - walked up to receive his diploma
after the ceremony he and his family celebrated with a graduation party at their home
but skladanek who hopes to either attend graduate school or go to work for the state commission for the blind and visually impaired wasn't interested in dwelling on his accomplishment
hours after the ceremony he was already antsy for a new challenge
i feel like i'm wasting time now not going to class he said

trying to capitalize on al gore's shaky abortion record bill bradley is set to air an ad accusing the vice president of straddling on what many democrats see as a bedrock issue
of the seven men running for president only one candidate has been pro-choice for everyone all the time a narrator says in the ad
gore says he has always believed that abortion should remain legal but for many years he voted to prevent government from paying for abortions for poor women in the medicaid program gore also voted in 1984 to define the word person under four civil rights laws to include unborn children from the moment of conception and in a 1987 letter to constituents he called abortion arguably the taking of human life
in the late 1980s gore changed his mind and began supporting medicaid abortion funding
bradley vowing to campaign more aggressively is hitting gore hard on the issue he pounded it in their debate wednesday and will begin airing a new television ad saturday in new hampshire which holds the nation's first primary on tuesday
this is the kind of issue you can't straddle bradley says speaking directly to the camera you can't be on both sides you have to decide which side you are on are you anti-abortion or are you pro-choice and i decided a long time ago that i'm pro-choice
the bradley ad coupled with his aggressive criticism of gore's abortion record represents a run at women voters who are crucial to democrats
gore emphasizes that he supports federal funding now and notes that there is no difference between the two candidates' current positions still the issue continues to dog him
appearing on a new hampshire public radio call-in show friday a woman accused gore of lying about his abortion record in wednesday's debate i don't know how i can support your candidacy if you're so dishonest on national tv she said
gore responded i have always supported roe vs wade i have always supported keeping abortion legal and it's true early in my career i voted to restrict the use of federal funding in some circumstances but over the years i've come to the view that federal funding ought to be available
the new bradley ad is among the sharpest of the democratic campaign but it stops short of being a direct attack not mentioning gore by name it's not unlike a gore ad that ran in iowa that picked on a bradley senate vote to declare that gore was the only democrat who was there for farmers during damaging floods
clearly anxious about gore's abortion-rights record his campaign on released friday an open letter from 42 members of congress stating that al gore is pro-choice
that letter was followed by a list of 300 new hampshire women pledging support for gore in part because of his commitment to women's health and abortion rights
but gore's campaign insists it is not worried about the abortion issue
i think the voters of new hampshire are very smart and recognize that this is the politics of desperation said gore spokesman chris lehane
bradley released three other ads on friday all of which were upbeat and positive
one recounted his work in passing legislation requiring health insurance companies to pay for at least 48 hours in the hospital after childbirth a second touted newspaper endorsement and the third had basketball legend bill russell urging people to turn out at the polls tuesday
a moroccan man was detained after crossing into the united states from canada and ordered held friday by a federal judge after prosecutors said he may be a material witness
federal officials who were treating the case with an unusual level of secrecy would not say what alerted them to the man youssef karroum or in what kind of case he may be a witness
harold malkin a spokesman for the us attorney in seattle said karroum was detained thursday at the border in northern washington state
malkin and other authorities would not say whether there was a connection between karroum and ahmed ressam an algerian who was stopped last month in port angeles after crossing into the country from canada with explosives in his car
ressam has pleaded innocent to charges that he had been planning a terrorist bombing
nearly 40 years after an american u-2 spy plane was shot down and its pilot captured by the soviet union a civilian version of the aircraft flew through russian airspace this week with permission
the national aeronautics and space administration mission was aimed at finding clues to ozone loss in the stratosphere over the arctic
one of nasa's california-based er-2 aircraft a variant of the lockheed u-2 passed southwest of moscow on thursday during a six-hour flight for the international research program
the flight was closely coordinated with russian observers nasa said friday
on may 1 1960 a u-2 reconnaissance plane was downed by a soviet missile and pilot francis gary powers was captured triggering a crisis that forced cancellation of an imminent paris summit conference
powers was tried in moscow forcing president dwight eisenhower to admit he lied when he denied the existence of the u-2 program which had been under way for years
the florida nun selected by attorney gen janet reno as a neutral party in the custody battle over elian gonzalez sought unsuccessfully on friday to persuade reno to change her mind about returning the 6-year-old to cuba sister jeanne o'laughlin also backed legislation to make elian an american citizen
conceding i am no longer neutral o'laughlin told reporters she has come to believe that separating elian now from his florida relatives would be another traumatic loss for him after the death of his mother at sea in november
her abandonment of impartiality was denounced by those seeking elian's return to his father
i am bewildered said rep maxine waters d-calif never in my wildest imagination would i think that a nun who was supposed to be a neutral party would undermine that neutrality
o'laughlin the barry university president whose miami beach home was used earlier in the week for a meeting between elian and his cuban grandmothers said she now thinks it is in the boy's best interest to stay in this country at least temporarily
but reno a longtime friend did not back away from her support of the immigration and naturalization service's ruling that the boy be returned to his father
she would only change her mind i believe if she could find legal reasons to change her mind and have adequate evidence that that would be necessary o'laughlin said outside the justice department
reno after escorting o'laughlin to the department door said in a written statement that she had listened to all she had to say she told me about her feelings observations and conclusions
however reno said i continue to believe based on all the information available to me including the information that sister jeanne shared with me that the person who speaks for this child is his one surviving parent - his father
despite the stark difference of opinion the two women remained friendly at the end of their meeting o'laughlin said i left my meeting with janet reno with a gigantic hug and a promise that we will both keep pursuing the truth as we see it
the ins ruling has not been carried out because the federal government agreed to postpone action until the family had an opportunity to challenge it in court which elian's florida relatives have done filing a lawsuit in miami
at a hearing friday in miami us district judge william hoeveler said he would hear arguments on feb 22 on whether the lawsuit should be dismissed on thursday the judge had set a hearing date of march 6
reno said she hoped the case would be resolved as quickly as possible
before meeting with reno o'laughlin visited sen connie mack r-fla chief sponsor of the citizenship bill and announced her support for it
the child has been in the torment of the seas and now he's been in the torment of political agendas somehow we must find for him calm seas at least for a while she said if it takes a congressional act to keep him here so be it she said
her support for the legislation came just as it appeared to be losing ground in congress elian's grandmothers made the rounds of capitol hill this week urging the boy's return to cuba
mack conceded that the grandmothers' visits had affected some of my colleagues costing potential support for his legislation but denied that o'laughlin's support for it would undermine her credibility or was intended on his part to counter the grandmothers' visits
we don't care about politics we care about our grandson said mariela quintana the paternal grandmother
the grandmothers might return to cuba this weekend said the rev joan brown campbell of the national council of churches which has facilitated their travel and supports the boy's return to cuba
in a statement friday the council said it was surprised that o'laughlin chose to step out of her assigned role of neutrality
we regret that sister jeanne in choosing to state her opinion after exercising the role of neutral host so admirably has in her action further fueled the fire of controversy and eliminated herself as a neutral facilitator in any future discussions on this matter the council said
the meeting in reno's office ran more than an hour and a half twice the scheduled length also present were ins commissioner doris meissner and peg albert a child psychologist and colleague of sister jeanne the ins is part of the justice department
elian has been the center of an international tug of war since he was found clinging to an inner tube nov 25 off the florida coast his mother and others traveling with him from cuba had drowned
chinese authorities freed a us college librarian on friday five months after they arrested him on charges of smuggling secret documents out of the country us and chinese officials said here
song yongyi who works at dickinson college in carlisle pa was scheduled to arrive in philadelphia on saturday afternoon
state department spokesman james foley said the us government was pleased by china's decision but did not believe there was any evidence to warrant his detention
however china's ambassador to the united states said in a statement that song admitted all the facts related to his criminal activities and also voluntarily revealed evidence against illegal activities of others
song's case was treated with leniency because of his repentance said the ambassador li zhao xing
song a 50-year-old chinese national who had planned to become a us citizen in september was on a trip to china in august to collect source material on the 1966-76 cultural revolution when he and his wife helen yao were detained his wife was allowed to return to the united states in november
dickinson officials have said song was collecting previously published material to bring to the united states but the chinese contended he was purchasing or illegally supplying intelligence to people outside china
foley cited the efforts of secretary of state madeleine k albright sen arlen specter r-pa and several congressional delegations that visited china for pressuring the chinese government to release song
specter said he learned of song's release during a meeting with li at the chinese embassy in washington on friday morning he said he believes chinese authorities released song to curry favor with congress which will decide whether to grant china permanent normal trade relations formerly known as most-favored-nation trading status
they know they'll need our votes said specter who declined to comment on song's alleged confession
contacted at home by the associated press song's wife yao said he called me and said he was free today is a very exciting day she said the state department told her song would arrive in detroit on saturday
dickinson president william durden said he was appreciative of the actions of the chinese government and look forward to his return to his family and our campus durden also declined to comment on the confession but called the release a victory for academic freedom
song is an expert on documents about the cultural revolution when millions in china were persecuted as mao tse-tung sought to consolidate his power the communist government continues to regard the period as extremely sensitive and heavily restricts access to archived material about it
colombia broke its own world record for kidnappings last year with nearly 3000 reported abductions a private watchdog group reported friday
dramatic mass abductions by leftist guerrilla contributed to a 33 percent increase in kidnappings according to the pais libre foundation the 2945 cases in 1999 compares to 2216 the year before
the surge in abductions helped spawn a citizen-based peace movement
half of the year's kidnappings were carried out by leftist rebels common criminal gangs were the second biggest culprits
the guerillas who often snare their victims at highway roadblocks have turned to ransom as a way to finance their armed struggle
the highest number of rebel abductions were attributed to colombia's largest guerrilla band the revolutionary armed forces of colombia or farc
but the year's most spectacular kidnappings were carried out by the smaller national liberation army or eln
in april the group hijacked an avianca airliner and abducted all 41 people aboard one month later eln commandoes raided a catholic mass and trucked more than a hundred faithful into the mountains
the report issued friday also noted a six-fold increase in kidnapping last year by the rebels' main rivals rightist paramilitary groups who are backed by wealthy landowners the militias kidnapped 120 people during 1999 pais libre reported among them well known human rights activists and a left-leaning senator
the federal judge hearing sen john mccain's request to get his name back on state presidential primary ballots said friday he was considering cutting by 80 percent the number of signatures state gop leaders can require candidates to collect
us district judge edward korman said it appeared new york's top republicans had designed onerous ballot access rules in an effort to close the presidential primary to all but their favorite candidate - this year texas gov george w bush
isn't that the reality of what's happening here korman asked during a three-and-a-half conference with lawyers from the state gop and the campaigns of mccain steve forbes and alan keyes it's being done to wall off the republican primary
a state judge threw mccain's name off ballots in eight new york congressional districts on thursday potentially leaving him unable to contest the march 7 primary in at least 12 of the state's 31 districts the possibility that republicans in more than a third of the state may be unable to vote for a candidate who some polls show leading in the crucial new hampshire primary has prompted renewed criticism of new york's notoriously arcane ballot access rules
the cumulative effect of these rules makes it virtually impossible for candidates to get on the ballot without spending a huge amount of money or having the support of the state party said mccain attorney burt neuborne it seriously burdens voters of the state of new york if they cannot express their support for sen john mccain
state party leaders say the requirements are a legitimate way of determining whether candidates have statewide support and that mccain's campaign should have done a better job of signature-gathering
the mccain campaign was not a reasonably diligent campaign and that's the standard said lawrence mandelker a lawyer for the state party
the forbes campaign - which has spent more than $650000 so far trying to get on the ballot - joined mccain's lawsuit and asked korman to place the millionaire publisher's name back on the ballot in three long island congressional districts where his petitions were declared invalid
mccain stumping in new hampshire said he welcomed forbes' involvement in the case
i am glad he's joined us mccain said it shows that other people are deprived ballot access
lawyers for keyes asked the judge to eliminate the requirement that signatures be collected district by district instead allowing candidates to appear on the ballot if they gather 5000 names statewide
keyes and gary bauer decided not to contest the new york primary because of the complicated requirements but keyes' lawyers asked that both candidates be allowed to try again under a lower standard
korman who said he hoped to issue a decision next week appeared to be considering a reduction in the number of signatures republican candidates must collect in each congressional district
candidates are now required to get signatures of 5% of each district's registered republicans plus 5000 more signatures statewide korman discussed with lawyers the possiblity of reducing the district requirement to 1%
he said he planned to make a final decision by the end of next week
as another winter blast was poised to pound georgia on friday president clinton freed up federal aid to the state to recover from last week's ice storm
georgia gov roy barnes asked the federal government to declare disasters in 39 northern counties because of the storm that left 500000 customers without electricity and caused an estimated $55 million in damage
also on friday north carolina gov james b hunt jr requested federal disaster aid to reimburse costs incurred by the state and 26 counties after a winter storm that hit the state jan 24 and 25 this storm blanketed the piedmont of north carolina with the greatest snowfall on record for a single event in the last 100 years hunt wrote in a letter
a disaster declaration makes federal money available to local governments and individuals for repairs and loans
meanwhile a blizzard heading into georgia this weekend was expected to cover a much greater area and drop up to 3 inches of snow plus sleet and freezing rain through super bowl sunday more than 100000 people are expected in atlanta for the game between the tennessee titans and the st louis rams
the state supreme court on friday ordered swift hearings and a quick conclusion to a lawsuit that is keeping new jersey from cashing in on hundreds of millions of dollars from the national settlement with the tobacco industry
the court ordered the appellate division to accelerate arguments in the case and then quickly rule on the appeal the case involves 12 smokers who objected to the state's settlement with big tobacco saying more antismoking measures should have been implemented
state officials and an attorney for the dozen new jersey residents say they are attempting to work out a settlement that would avert having the case to go court but several issues remain unresolved
the court case has huge budget implication for new jersey under the settlement new jersey is to receive $76 billion over 25 years state officials say more than $180 million of the settlement money has been put in escrow until the lawsuit is resolved gov christie whitman on monday said in her budget message that she wants to use the money for a variety of health-related programs and also to help subsidize a school construction program nearing $10 billion
under the tobacco agreement new jersey would lose the $76 billion if the matter isn't settled by dec 31 2001
those on both sides of the dispute however said friday they expect a settlement
anything that moves us closer to a settlement will be good news across the board for new jersey said peter mcdonough whitman's chief spokesman there are some very good state programs funded through this settlement
the lawsuit filed in 1997 demands that programs such as clinics to help people stop smoking be written into the agreement other demands include chest x-rays cancer screening and medical exams
terry paul bottinelli who is representing the 12 smokers in the lawsuit said many of those things were included in whitman's budget message he said the state and his clients are getting close to a settlement but concedes there are issues that could force a trial
what we have been looking for has been the establishment of tobacco control programs and antismoking programs said bottinelli it looks like the governor is funding this
the 12 involved in the lawsuit are not asking for personal payments he said
bottinelli and state officials however said several issues are unresolved such as whether or not the tobacco industry should have to pay lawyers fees and what role the state will have in future lawsuit or fee matters
the courts set no hearing date on friday
a posse of sharpshooters has taken to buffalo's residential streets with 22-caliber rifles and their sights on pigeons
the band of pigeon busters is part of the city's animal control squad and is armed daily with poison traps and rifles to handle residents' complaints about unwanted wildlife
the common council is considering a request to hire two more officers to the six-member pest control squad
they are a bunch of inhumane cowboys enjoying target practice on taxpayer dollars said stephanie boyles wildlife biologist for people for the ethical treatment of animals residents who like pigeons or those who just don't want bullets flying down their street shouldn't be paying for this
the group learned of the practice through a buffalo news article officials weren't sure how long the shooting has been going on shooting nuisance birds by government officials has been practiced in other cities nationwide shooting within city limits would be illegal in most municipalities if done by private citizens
the mayor's spokesperson peter cutler said that peta's letter demanding the hunt to be stopped and suggested options will be taken seriously
we're concerned for the health and safety of all residents so we need to watch out for disease but on the same token we don't want anybody harmed while these guys are out there cutler said he said the rifles are used in the most extreme circumstances
we'll give serious review to other methods and take the most appropriate action he said
sharpshooters are ready each weekday to get rid of the unwanted birds frank poincelot the city's head pest-control and wildlife officer told the buffalo news that on a good day they the pest-control officers could go through 50 or 60 rounds of ammunition
that means 50 to 60 dead birds because officials insist the crew doesn't miss its shots which are often at birds perched on roof peaks of single- and two-family houses although a 22-caliber bullet can travel a mile or more and potentially through a bird animal control officials said the shooting isn't a threat to people most bird hunting is done with shotguns not 22 caliber rifles
the main complaint of residents is the droppings left by roosting pigeons some fear the spread of disease but most just don't like cleaning up the mess
everyday in the spring i'm hosing my driveway and scraping my windshield said ann marie cortese of north buffalo those birds make me have extra work
pigeons have been accused of spreading everything from salmonella to meningitis and tuberculosis
peta's website charges that pest control companies have spread the misconception that urban pigeons spread disease the vast majority of people are at little health risk from pigeons and have a better chance of getting struck by lighting the organization writes
ms boyles concedes that the droppings can be a nuisance sure they are annoying but only effective methods will get rid of them she said when you kill a bird the only thing that'll happen is that another will take its place
peta suggests that homeowners and building managers should take measures to make the roosting site less hospitable in the first place tying up wind chimes playing a radio putting up effigies of predator birds or flying a balloon with big eyes drawn on it have all proven effective according to peta
people feed the birds or leave their trash out attracting them ms boyles said and then the birds are shot at paying for our irresponsibility
independence for taiwan would mean war with china vice premier qian qichen warned friday as china stressed anew its own plan for reunification
qian warned that those who want independence for taiwan should not play with fire the state-run xinhua news agency reported late friday taiwan independence absolutely will not mean peace but war he added
qian spoke friday at a forum marking the fifth anniversary of beijing's plan to reunify with taiwan under the one country two systems model it used for hong kong and macau
qian a foreign policy specialist who oversaw the return of hong kong in 1997 and macau in december reiterated the government's offer of giving taiwan more autonomy under more flexible policies than the arrangements with the other two territories
negotiations with taiwan could include international space for economic cultural and social activities for taiwan that suits it and the political status of the taiwan authorities he said according to xinhua
qian repeated the mainland's offer that anything could be discussed as long as taiwan agreed to the one-china principle he also reiterated the government's condemnation of taiwan president lee teng-hui for saying last summer that the two sides should be treated as equals in talks
china regards taiwan as one of its provinces the mainland and the island of taiwan have been ruled separately since the end of the chinese civil war in 1949 beijing demands that they be reunited eventually and has long threatened to use military force if taiwan declares independence
sacramento police arrested the mayor of neighboring folsom and accused him of offering an undercover female officer cash and cocaine for sex
mayor everett reginald drew known as reggie drew was one of eight people arrested thursday night in the second police sweep made under a new city law that allows authorities to impound cars used in prostitution and drug crimes police chief arturo venegas said
drew 57 was booked on five felony and misdemeanor prostitution and drug counts and released on $5000 bond the sacramento county district attorney will decide whether to file formal charges
drew leaving jail friday morning waved his arms when asked about the charges
until we're through the judicial process i can't comment he said
drew is mayor of folsom a city of 48000 in eastern sacramento county known mainly for its giant state prison complex he is also a manager with the state prison industry authority
police said the mayor approached the officer who was standing on a sacramento street and struck up a conversation
he offered cash as well as a small quantity of rock cocaine for the sex act they agreed upon said capt ted mandalla he declined to give additional details
they went to a nearby motel the police were using for the sweep and arrested drew there police said
drew was captured on a video the department was making for a planned press conference friday to tout the success of the two sweeps mandalla said
results of chemical tests taken to determine if drew was under the influence of drugs are not yet back he said
lockheed martin corp slashed its dividend in half friday continuing a belt-tightening that already includes plans for 2800 new job cuts in an attempt to reverse setbacks at its aerospace and aviation businesses
the nation's second-largest defense business after boeing co also reported fourth-quarter earnings after excluding one-time gains fell 20 percent from a year earlier matching wall street's diminished expectations
lockheed officials reiterated a warning first made last october that the bleak financial picture would continue into the new year but projected gains in the years to come
we have a very strong conviction that the year 2000 will be the low point for earnings and cash generation for this corporation chief financial officer robert j stevens told analysts in a telephone conference call friday
lockheed stock fell about 3 percent for the second day in a row dropping 56 1/4 cents to $1887 1/2 in trading at 515 pm on the new york stock exchange
cutting quarterly dividend payments from 22 cents a share to 11 cents effective with the payout due march 31 is the latest in a series of measures aimed at improving the bottom line reducing the dividend frees up about $180 million analysts said
consistent with our previously announced focus on reducing debt it is prudent to change the dividend at this time said vance coffman the chairman and chief executive of the bethesda md-based maker of rockets satellites and the f-16 fighter jet
on thursday the company announced it was eliminating 2 percent of its 140000 jobs worldwide lockheed said the new cuts of 2800 jobs in its aircraft and rockets businesses would produce $200 million in annual savings the latest retrenchment brings the total number of jobs eliminated in recent months to 4500
the purpose of these actions is to drive down indirect and administrative costs to improve earnings and cash flow and reduce debt while improving focus on these businesses coffman said friday
lockheed said it was considering whether to add another subsidiary lockheed martin ims to the list of eight company businesses on the auction block the teaneck nj-based unit which had sales of $500 million last year provides services to government including child-support collection and ticketing drivers caught on red-light cameras
company officials also said they planned to close a deal to acquire bethesda-based comsat corp in the first six months of 2000 lockheed bought 49 percent of the satellite service provider last year but cannot purchase the rest until congress changes comsat's ownership rules to allow it the house and senate are expected to begin working out final legislation next month
analysts gave mixed reviews
all the bad news is out we think the stock is in the midst of a turnaround said jeff pittsburg of pittsburg institutional inc who is advising his clients to buy the stock i think the dividends the layoffs they're trying to create the cash flow they're telling you they're going to generate a lot of cash and that's very important
paul nisbet of jsa research inc rates the stock a hold - one of the lowest ratings generally given by analysts he said the stock is in limbo
the prospects as they have outlined them to us certainly aren't very bright he said it doesn't exactly exude confidence
for the fourth quarter of 1999 lockheed reported earnings of $293 million or 76 cents a share compared with $125 million or 33 cents a share in the same 1998 period
profit in the latest quarter included $102 million or 17 cents a share in one-time gains from the sale of surplus real estate noncore businesses and the company's stock in l3 communication holdings the earnings of 59 cents after eliminating the unusual gains met the average estimate of analysts surveyed by first call/thomson financial
for the year lockheed earned $382 million or 99 cents a share compared with $1 billion or $263 a share in 1998 excluding one-time charges earnings for 1999 would have been $150 vs $299 for the previous year
in october the company cut its earnings forecast for 2000 by more than half to about $1 per share and lockheed saw its stock lose nearly half its value
but the company also said it expected earnings per share to grow at an annual rate of 15 percent to 25 percent in the near term with growth at the lower end of the range in 2001
lockheed's problems have been aggravated by troubles in its space systems business there have been several rocket launch failures as well as satellite delays and the loss of satellite contracts such as a long-held us spy satellite contract reportedly worth $45 billion
sales of the company's flagship aircraft the f-16 fighter jet have dwindled lockheed delivered 109 of the planes in 1998 down from 150 in the previous year the company now is almost entirely dependent on foreign sales

prime minister jerzy buzek's cabinet emerged unscathed friday after the ruling solidarity party beset by infighting and plunging public approval ratings met to hash out ways to restore its battered image
after hours of closed meetings solidarity party leader marian krzaklewski said there would be no cabinet changes - despite a clamor by some party factions for buzek to be replaced
solidarity is a coalition of several factions krzaklewski said they can have different approaches but the approach of the bloc is the one supported by the majority
krzaklewski said solidarity leaders agreed to reform the bloc's parliamentary caucus in february draft a new government program in march and select a presidential candidate in april
friday's talks reflected desperation within the party which has its roots in the solidarity movement that toppled communism in 1989 to keep its members in line behind unpopular economic reforms
some party factions have been voting against the government in parliament and are demanding that buzek be replaced party leaders have responded by saying those deputies could be banned from running again on solidarity's ticket
solidarity's troubles are deepening as former communists exploit public anger over cost-cutting in social services and a restructuring of moribund state industries that is leaving many poles without work
a poll released this week by the cbos agency put solidarity's public approval rating at a record low 16 percent all recent credible surveys suggest that if an election were held today the former communists who governed in the mid-1990s would return to power
solidarity leaders and their junior coalition partner the center-right freedom union are reluctant to backtrack on reforms that have won high praise from the west and set poland on course to join the european union they say the problem is a matter of poor public relations not policy
one group of rebellious solidarity deputies even has organized a survey to ask journalists what the party is doing wrong
one question asks respondents to choose which term best describes the party's media policy joke chaos incompetence lies fun sabotage stupidity order professionalism accuracy truthfulness or honesty
the feuding is being watched closely by western investors whose anxiety runs high whenever economic reforms come under threat
a storm spread still more snow across the deep south on friday giving children from arkansas to georgia a rare chance to build snowmen but threatening travel to the super bowl
the storm which had dumped up to 17 inches of snow in oklahoma dropped between an inch and a foot in arkansas mississippi alabama and tennessee before stalling near the alabama-georgia line
fourth-grader trent franklin stayed up until after midnight to watch the flakes start falling outside his shelby county ala home then he got up at daybreak bundled up and went outside to play in 2 inches of snow
i've got so many layers on i can't get cold he said
the storm to was expected to re-form and head east hitting the atlanta area with up to 3 inches of snow through super bowl sunday
it could potentially turn into a significant icing weather channel meteorologist robyn hulecki said
as a precaution delta air lines canceled some flights into atlanta friday afternoon but promised to accommodate passengers trying to get to the super bowl more than 100000 people are expected in atlanta for the game between the tennessee titans and the st louis rams
we want the customers to get down there to the super bowl said john farmer delta station manager in nashville tenn we'll work with them any way we can to get them there by kickoff
todd benson 28 of kansas city mo managed to beat the storm and arrive at the atlanta airport friday i feel very lucky that we made it here that the flight did not get canceled he said
while travelers worried thousands of children in the deep south enjoyed a rare snow day they threw snowballs and built snowmen as their parents took friday off from work
in alabama tv stations stayed on the air all night giving live updates from cold reporters framed on the screen by winter storm 2000 graphics
brothers brad and david dooley in the birmingham ala area enjoyed the day off from class by working on a snowman outside their house roads were clear but their mother had no complaints about schools being closed
how could they do anything with this out there said cynthia dooley
mississippi gov ronnie musgrove activated about 300 national guardsmen to help communities
officials elsewhere also were treating the weather with urgency
in north carolina which was surprised by 2 feet of snow this week gov jim hunt on friday asked president clinton to declare 26 counties disaster areas which would make them eligible for federal funds about 13000 customers remained with power in the state but they were expected to have it back by friday night
president clinton approved a disaster declaration late friday for 30 georgia counties because of an ice storm last week that left 500000 customers without electricity and caused an estimated $55 million in damage
this weekend's storm is expected to cover a much greater area
the thruway authority board has quietly adopted a plan which could provide for annual increases in tolls to pay for improvements to the superhighway and other transportation projects
the board thursday voted to go forward with a previously unannounced plan to tie future toll increases on the thruway to the construction cost index which is an average of construction material and labor costs in 20 us cities the first-year hike would be 18 percent under that system according to thruway authority executive director john platt
tolls at the short-trip barriers around buffalo and new york city would not go up because they are rounded to the nearest quarter but virtually all other tolls on the ticketed part of the superhighway would go up by 18 percent rounded to the nearest nickel
thruway officials will hold four public hearings to gather comment on the toll-increase plan and finalize the plan this spring thruway spokeswoman anya frost said
platt insisted that no final decision has been made
it is not cast in stone at all he said
tolls were last raised on the thruway the nation's longest toll road in 1988 in 1996 the thruway board backed away from a toll hike at the insistence of gov george pataki
there was little if any advance word that the board was contemplating a toll hike before thursday's meeting the press release issued by the authority afterward spoke of the agency funding $275 million in capital improvements this year not until the second page of the release did the authority refer to the adoption of a plan which could result in an annual toll hike - it called it an indexed toll adjustment plan - beginning june 1
this common-sense plan will ensure that motorists are never hit with massive toll hikes while providing businesses that rely on the thruway with the information they need when planning their budgets the authority said in a statement from chairman louis tomson
the majority leader of the state senate said friday he is opposed to raising tolls joseph bruno cited such a hike as running counter to recent state efforts to cut taxes and other costs of doing business in the state
now is not the time for the thruway authority to impose a hidden tax on upstate businesses residents and commuters in the form of multiyear toll hikes bruno r-rensselaer said
if the senate majority wants to make money available for capital projects we'll be more than happy to discuss this alternative platt said but otherwise we need to be able to have a hedge against the cost of construction
the state motor truck association blasted the authority for the secretive manner in which it voted to raise tolls and said it appeared there was nothing to prevent tolls from going up 3 percent every year if construction costs continue to rise annually
as business people we would never increase our prices to our largest customers without first consulting with them grumbled the motor truck association's president bill joyce
it called on pataki to ask the thruway authority to reexamine its projected toll hike and to find other ways to fund improvements on the roadway
pataki spokesman michael mckeon refused to take a stance on the plan at this point it's just a proposal he said there's going to be public hearings we'll let the process move forward
under the $275 million in projects to be put out for bid this year by the thruway was work on the interstate 287 corridor around the tappan zee bridge and the syracuse inner harbor development project
both projects are among the transportation facilities the thruway has assumed authority for in recent years critics say the drain of these other facilities have put additional financial burdens on the authority past that of maintaining the original toll highway between new york city and the pennsylvania border
tomson was a former deputy to pataki and was nominated by the governor to the thruway position it is unlikely that the thruway authority board would proceed with a toll hike plan without the prior knowledge of pataki's office
a federal proposal to ship nuclear waste across ohio puts people at risk of radiation exposure from potential rail or truck accidents critics said friday
i think people will want to know if they are getting hundreds of free x-rays as they are sitting in traffic rep dennis kucinich d-ohio said at a department of energy public hearing
ohio as a key transit point between east coast nuclear plants and a proposed nevada repository for nuclear waste would bear an unfair burden involving nuclear waste shipping kucinich said
kucinich a critic of increased rail traffic through his congressional district in cleveland was the leadoff witness at the 20th in a series of energy department hearings on proposals for a nuclear-waste repository inside yucca mountain about 100 miles northwest of las vegas
the nuclear power industry says the shipments would be safe
the six-month period for public comment will end feb 9 then the president and congress must decide whether to proceed with the proposal which would not take effect until 2010
nationwide more than 42000 tons of lethal commercial waste are being kept at nuclear plants at yucca mountain the waste would be sealed in metal containers within rock tunnels about 1000 feet underground and 1000 feet above the water table
santa clara county transit authorities have ordered the removal of graphic cancer-awareness posters depicting women scarred by mastectomies
created by the san francisco-based breast cancer fund the posters feature women provocatively posed as if in lingerie ads but with mastectomy scars superimposed on their chests
residents in santa clara county and elsewhere in the san francisco bay area have complained about the posters since they appeared about two weeks ago the billboard company that had agreed to put them on san francisco bus shelters also rejected the ads after seeing them
we will not run ads that anyone will find offensive said lupe solis a spokeswoman for the santa clara valley transportation authority
breast cancer fund founder andrea martin whose mastectomy scars were used in the pictures said she was disappointed
what about those who think this is a positive thing too bad she said
about 17 posters remain on bus shelters in oakland and adjoining contra costa county martin said
an american airlines jet that crashed off the end of a wet runway in a storm could have landed safely if all its braking systems had worked properly aviation experts testified friday
instead flight 1420 left the runway still going about 100 mph then hit a metal lighting structure broke apart and caught fire eleven people died in the june 1 crash at the little rock airport including the pilot
the mcdonnell-douglas md-82 landed in heavy rain and 25 mph crosswinds but that alone was not enough to cause it to run off the runway according to boeing corp tests exhibited at a national transportation safety board hearing
the plane's braking was hindered because it did not use its spoilers - wing panels that help deceleration by putting more weight on the wheels said thomas yager a nasa research engineer who specializes in runway braking
with spoilers 80 percent of the plane's weight is placed on a plane's main landing gear said cj turner a boeing engineer boeing now owns mcdonnell-douglas
without spoilers less than 30 percent of the weight remains on the main landing gear making it much more difficult to brake turner said in a crosswind - as was the case with the accident - without spoilers the main landing gear will bear just 7 percent of the load
the flight recorders indicated that the spoilers did not deploy but it was unclear whether the crew failed to set them or whether there was a mechanical problem
co-pilot michael origel has testified that he believed chief pilot richard buschmann set the spoilers to deploy automatically upon landing but origel whose duty it was to confirm the task said he could not recall the position of the spoiler handle before the accident
instances in which spoilers have not deployed when properly set are very rare said robert baker vice chairman of american airlines' parent company amr corp
the deceleration of flight 1420 was also impeded because the pilots did not apply wheel brakes until 11 seconds after touchdown - choosing to use manual brakes instead of brakes that deploy automatically
part of the reason for the braking delay was that the chief pilot was trying to straighten the plane after an off-center touchdown
representatives of american airlines and its pilots union questioned whether a flooded runway could have also affected the landing
but yager said runway markings showed no evidence of hydroplaning and that the runway was of the highest quality with good traction and drainage he said the plane's tire treads also were good
the runway itself was not at fault yager said
someone is tarnishing robert c smith's good name
and in at least some instances it's smith's good friend say police
at least five times in the past two years area police have wrongly filed charges against the 20-year-old syracuse man after catching someone who claimed to be him
attorneys for the real robert smith have managed to get the charges dismissed but the mistakes resulted in new york suspending smith's license warrants being issued for his arrest and smith having to appear in court on several occasions
the most recent episode occurred last weekend when police arrested five men on felony drug charges after finding them in possession of 11 ounces of crack cocaine
it turned out the person who gave smith's name was jeffrey dowdell jr 21 who has been friends with smith since the attended elementary school together in liverpool
dowdell did not have any identification when he was arrested but provided deputies with smith's correct date of birth and address said john d'eredita spokesman for the onondaga county sheriff's department at the jail however a deputy recognized him as dowdell d'eredita said
the deception earned dowdell an extra charge criminal impersonation a misdemeanor
smith's mother celestine smith said she doubted her son will remain friends with dowdell
he's tired of being dragged through the mud and being in court all the time being deaf is hard enough said mrs smith of her son who lost his hearing three years ago after contracting meningitis
they were friends since the time they were 9 years old but he can't be too much of our friend if he's doing this to us she said
smith did not want to talk about the affair
dowdell though maintained that smith was his friend and said he was sorry
i know my man robert i know he's mad at me but he'll get over it that's my man dowdell said in a jailhouse interview with the post-standard of syracuse
celestine smith said dowdell admitted to her this summer that he had pretended to be her son on a previous occasion when he was stopped by police
he said he didn't think robert would get in trouble because he can't hear said mrs smith
dowdell admitted monday that he told police he was smith last fall when they confiscated $1000 from him because he was in a drug-infested neighborhood and had no proof he had legally earned the money
however dowdell said he never got any tickets in smith's name
but syracuse police issued three separate appearance tickets in smith's name to an impersonator said attorney december haab who represented smith
the appearance tickets noted that the suspect had a scar on his face and a tattoo - which the real smith does not have haab said neither does dowdell
warrants were issued in 1999 for smith's arrest for failing to appear in court on a marijuana charge the warrants and charges were dismissed after haab met with prosecutors
suspects occasionally deceive police as to their true identity but are usually caught within hours after they are booked and fingerprinted authorities said
i think it's unusual haab said of smith's predicament i hope it's unusual
somewhere dionne warwick knew this would happen
new york city officials sensing bad publicity and worse jokes announced friday that they would no longer funnel welfare recipients into jobs with the psychic network the telephone pay service offered clairvoyance at $499 a minute
the decision to pull the plug on the psychic connection came hours after the hiring policy became public knowledge since last april network instructors had taught 15 welfare clients to read tarot cards and offer their callers a peek into the future
though hra believes people should have the freedom to choose their own employment hra's business link has decided to not include the psychic network as one of its participating employers said a statement from human resources administration commissioner jason a turner
this leaves welfare workers applying for employment with a less interesting selection of jobs from a variety of companies rite aid madison square garden macy's
not quite the psychic gig eh
initially hra spokeswoman ruth reinecke said the jobs while odd-sounding were actually not strange at all
the pay is rather good and it's attractive to work out of the home for the mothers who have young children she said
the qualifications were a high school diploma and the ability to read write and speak english the pay starts at $10 an hour plus bonuses
the city refused to provide any information about the psychic network citing a confidentiality agreement with companies that participate in the workfare program
the hra offices received a large number of calls about the plan after the new york times first reported it a pittsburgh radio reporter trying to track down an hra spokeswoman said the report was the subject of great mirth in the steel city
a woman in the hra offices friday was laughing when she answered another reporter's call is this about the psychics she intuitively inquired
while the 900-number services are a quirky business they are legitimate their ads must run with a required disclaimer that the calls are strictly for entertainment value
trying to track down the owner of the psychic network could require the use of tea leaves the only phone listing under the name is a florida bookstore that has no connection to the telephone business
in new york there was no listing for the psychic network attempts to reach the company telepathically were also unsuccessful
the psychic phone lines often advertised on late-night television or via informercials haven't drawn this much attention since the psychic friends network filed for chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in february 1998
the psychic friends - actually inphomation communication inc - were best-known for the 30-minute informercials hosted by singer dionne warwick
a middletown police sergeant died friday after his cruiser went off route 9 and crashed during a pursuit of two burglary suspects police said
sgt george dingwall a 19-year veteran was one of several officers chasing the suspects at about noon when his cruiser went off the left side of the highway and crashed into some trees said lt ralph carpenter a state police spokesman
police were investigating whether the cruiser was rammed by the suspects' car police said
dingwall was taken by life star helicopter to hartford hospital where he later died
as the suspects' vehicle proceeded down route 9 the vehicle rammed a middletown police cruiser carpenter said it continued further down southbound and ended up ramming one of our state police cruisers
the car was stopped on interstate 95 in branford by troopers using stop sticks a spiked device that when driven over slowly deflates a car's tires
bryant brown 36 and victor santiago 38 both from new haven were taken into custody they were being held on numerous charges
the chase began when police interrupted a burglary in progress at a home in middletown police said
the accident and investigation closed route 9 southbound near exit 3 in essex the highway remained closed after 8 pm friday
flags were flying at half staff friday afternoon in front of the middletown police headquarters to honor dingwall
he had a distinguished career and he was well respected by all of us at the middletown police department said police chief j edward brymer we have lost a family member
the federal judge hearing sen john mccain's request to get his name back on state presidential primary ballots said friday he was considering cutting by 80 percent the number of signatures state gop leaders can require candidates to collect
us district judge edward korman said it appeared new york's top republicans had designed onerous ballot access rules in an effort to close the presidential primary to all but their favorite candidate - this year texas gov george w bush
isn't that the reality of what's happening here korman asked during a three-and-a-half hour conference with lawyers from the state gop and the campaigns of mccain steve forbes and alan keyes it's being done to wall off the republican primary
a state judge threw mccain's name off ballots in eight new york congressional districts on thursday potentially leaving him unable to contest the march 7 primary in a total of 14 of the state's 31 districts the possibility that republicans in more than a third of the state may be unable to vote for a candidate who some polls show leading in the crucial new hampshire primary has prompted renewed criticism of new york's notoriously arcane ballot access rules
the cumulative effect of these rules makes it virtually impossible for candidates to get on the ballot without spending a huge amount of money or having the support of the state party mccain attorney burt neuborne said in brooklyn federal court it seriously burdens voters of the state of new york if they cannot express their support for sen john mccain
state party leaders say the requirements are a legitimate way of determining whether candidates have statewide support and that mccain's campaign should have done a better job of signature-gathering
the mccain campaign was not a reasonably diligent campaign and that's the standard said lawrence mandelker a lawyer for the state party
the forbes campaign joined mccain's lawsuit and asked korman to place the millionaire publisher's name back on the ballot in three long island congressional districts where his petitions were declared invalid forbes has so far spent more than $650000 trying to get on the ballot
mccain stumping in new hampshire said he welcomed forbes' involvement in the case
i am glad he's joined us mccain said it shows that other people are deprived ballot access too
lawyers for keyes asked the judge to eliminate the requirement that signatures be collected district by district and instead allow candidates to appear on the ballot if they gather 5000 names statewide
keyes and gary bauer decided not to contest the new york primary because of the complicated requirements but keyes' lawyers asked that both candidates be allowed to try again under a lower standard
korman who said he hoped to issue a decision next week appeared to be considering a reduction in the number of signatures republican candidates must collect in each congressional district
candidates are now required to get signatures of 5 percent of each district's registered republicans plus 5000 more signatures statewide korman discussed with lawyers the possibility of reducing the district requirement to 1 percent
he said he planned to make a final decision by the end of next week
forbes sued successfully in federal court in 1996 to appear on the ballot when state party leaders lined up behind eventual nominee bob dole korman ruled then that the party must reduce its per-district signature requirement from 5 percent to 5 percent party leaders and the state legislature decided last year to use the judge's requirement this time around
but korman on friday criticized the gop for imposing other burdensome rules and challenging so many signatures that the 5 percent is not a true 5 percent he questioned the requirement that volunteers only be allowed to gather signatures in their own districts the imposition of a 37-day limit on petition drives and the fact that the drives fall during the busy holiday season
why are there 37 days only the judge asked why is it the hardest 37 days why are there restrictions on who can circulate petitions there ought to be some answers
meanwhile forbes plans to challenge bush's petitions in six districts where campaign workers claim to have uncovered fraud including lists of signatures apparently written in the same handwriting
jeffrey buley general counsel to the state republican committee said that although there might be isolated incidents of fraud he was confident all of bush's petitions were valid
venezuela's highest court has struck down a lawsuit claiming its own magistrates were appointed illegally by a powerful constitutional assembly overstepping its bounds
the ruling thursday was a setback for critics of president hugo chavez who say he has concentrated power into his own hands and brought the country dangerously close to dictatorship but it is also likely to stir further controversy about the way the president is carrying out his social revolution in venezuela
the same lawsuit claimed that a new mini-congress the attorney general the national comptroller the public defender and the national electoral council were all designated illegally each of those claims was shot down by venezuela's newly created supreme tribunal of justice
since becoming president a year ago chavez has pushed through a new constitution and decimated the two political parties that ruled the south american nation during 40 years of democracy
the new constitution approved by voters on dec 15 calls for the renewal of all elected powers but national balloting has been postponed until may because of last month's massive flooding and landslides that killed thousands of people on venezuela's northern coast
in the meantime chavez a former army paratrooper who staged a failed military coup eight years ago will be able to rule venezuela with virtually no checks on his power
on thursday 21 members of a so-called mini-congress made up of chavez supporters were sworn in the mini-congress's job will be to perform basic legislative functions until elections are held for a new legislature
like the high court magistrates the mini-congress's members were each handpicked by the chavez-controlled panel that rewrote the constitution
a venezuelan attorney named eduardo garcia presented a lawsuit to the court saying this was illegal
but the court ruled that the constitutional assembly had the power to make the appointments because it was given originating power by the venezuelan people in national elections
chavez and his supporters say the profound changes taking place in venezuelan society and politics will root out decades of corruption and crush a corrupt oligarchy that plunged the oil-rich nation into poverty
on friday chavez appointed a former fellow coup participant head of venezuela's secret police eliecer otaiza replaces retired col jesus urdaneta another former coup plotter who resigned last week because of a conflict with the foreign minister
chavez has come under criticism for promoting former coup participants to top government posts and for giving the military a larger role in venezuelan society
a storm spread still more snow across the deep south on friday giving children from arkansas to georgia a rare chance to build snowmen but threatening travel to the super bowl
the storm which had dumped up to 17 inches of snow in oklahoma dropped between an inch and a foot in arkansas mississippi alabama and tennessee before stalling near the alabama-georgia line

i've got so many layers on i can't get cold he said
the storm to was expected to re-form and head east hitting the atlanta area with up to 3 inches of snow through super bowl sunday
it could potentially turn into a significant icing weather channel meteorologist robyn hulecki said
as a precaution delta air lines canceled some flights into atlanta friday afternoon but promised to accommodate passengers trying to get to the super bowl more than 100000 people are expected in atlanta for the game between the tennessee titans and the st louis rams

clinton approved a disaster declaration late friday for 30 georgia counties because of an ice storm last week that left 500000 customers without electricity and caused an estimated $55 million in damage
this weekend's storm is expected to cover a much greater area
berlin police on friday banned a planned weekend demonstration against the building of a holocaust memorial in the center of the city citing the potential for violence
authorities said the saturday demonstration was actually just a cover for a march by the extreme-right national party of germany that had originally been set to take place in the central city of goettingen that event was banned by local authorities there on thursday because of fears of violence
police have reason to believe that for berlin there is also a large possibility that the procession will take a confrontational course berlin police said friday in a statement
also planned for saturday was an event by supporters of the memorial who will take to the streets around the site to solicit donations for the project earlier cost estimates have been around $10 million although designs for a documentation center to be located at the site have not been finalized
german leaders on thursday held a ceremonial dedication for the monument to be located just south of the landmark brandenburg gate consisting of a vast field of 2700 close-set concrete slabs resembling stones in a graveyard thursday was also germany's annual day of remembrance for victims of nazism established in 1996 to coincide with the day soviet soldiers liberated the auschwitz death camp in nazi-occupied poland in 1945

in the final hours of international talks friday on trade in genetically modified food and other products negotiators found themselves grappling over the same issues that doomed a similar agreement nearly a year ago
delegates scurried from room to room of the montreal hotel where the meeting was being held bearing proposals and counterproposals late in the afternoon conference president juan mayr delayed what was to be the final meeting of the disagreeing parties by four hours early in the evening he pushed the meeting back yet again
mayr who set a deadline of friday night also has said that he will not leave montreal without an agreement
somebody has to give in somewhere said ethiopian head delegate towalde egziabher
negotiators were attempting to draft the biosafety protocol a set of rules that would protect the environment from damage by genetically modified plants animals and bacteria environmentalists and a few scientific studies have raised concerns that genetically modified organisms could wipe out native species disrupt natural cycles and cause other ecological damage
there's fish genes in fruit poultry genes in fish animal genes in plants growth hormones in milk insect genes in vegetables tree genes in grain and in the case of pork human genes in meat said steve gilman an organic farmer in stillwater ny real and reasonable concerns about genetic engineering have fallen upon deaf ears
the debate at the talks has revolved around how great the scientific uncertainty is and how it should be dealt with the european union and developing nations have argued that countries should be allowed to decline imports of a genetically modified product if little is known about its environmental effect
but the united states and its partners disagree saying the proposed rules in their current form would restrict trade those countries argued that any nation's refusal to import a genetically modified product should be backed by scientific evidence in the form of a risk assessment
we live in a world in which scientific certainty is not available said us undersecretary of state frank loy
talks last february in cartagena colombia ended in disarray when the united states and five other countries - canada australia argentina chile and uruguay - rejected a draft agreement favored by 125 other countries
the situation has changed since then with major us food producers such as archer daniels midland gerber and the iams pet food company either demanding that genetically modified products be segregated or refusing to use them altogether protests at the world trade organization talks in seattle last month also suggest that the american public has concerns about genetically altered food
in the year since cartagena it has become obvious that the position of the united states' group is increasingly isolated said philip bereano a university of washington professor who has been following the talks
just as in cartagena the talks in montreal have come down to a handful of issues
the relationship of the proposed rules to the world trade organization the united states wants the agreement to have equal status with the free trade pact but other countries fear that any bans they impose will be overturned by the world trade organization's dispute resolution panel
the amount of scientific evidence that is needed to justify banning a genetically modified product
the amount of evidence that exporters must provide about their products
genetically modified crops are already widespread about 70 million acres of genetically engineered plants were cultivated worldwide in 1999 in the united states genetically engineered varieties account for about 25 percent of corn and 40 percent of soybeans
former secretary of state henry kissinger on friday canceled a speech scheduled for next week at the university of texas citing safety concerns over a planned protest
kissinger national security adviser to president nixon and secretary of state to both nixon and president ford had been scheduled to speak tuesday
two groups - ut radical action network and peace action austin - held a meeting on campus earlier this week to denounce kissinger's foreign policy during his days in office and to plan a protest for next week
harry middleton director of the lyndon baines johnson library at ut said university police and the secret service had warned that the planned protests posed a threat to public safety
pat borders assistant director of the lbj library said protesters indicated they would disrupt kissinger's speech attempts to control the protests could create problems for other spectators borders said
in a statement kissinger said he regrets the cancellation
calls to one of the protest organizers professor robert jensen were not returned

independence for taiwan would mean war with china vice premier qian qichen warned friday as china stressed anew its own plan for reunification
qian warned that those who want independence for taiwan should not play with fire the state-run xinhua news agency reported late friday taiwan independence absolutely will not mean peace but war he added
qian spoke friday at a forum marking the fifth anniversary of beijing's plan to reunify with taiwan under the one country two systems model it used for hong kong and macau
qian a foreign policy specialist who oversaw the return of hong kong in 1997 and macau in december reiterated the government's offer of giving taiwan more autonomy under more flexible policies than the arrangements with the other two territories
negotiations with taiwan could include international space for economic cultural and social activities for taiwan that suits it and the political status of the taiwan authorities he said according to xinhua
qian repeated the mainland's offer that anything could be discussed as long as taiwan agreed to the one-china principle he also reiterated the government's condemnation of taiwan president lee teng-hui for saying last summer that the two sides should be treated as equals in talks
he also repeated china's opposition to any foreign force - a reference the united states - selling advanced weapons to taiwan or transferring technologies for a missile-defense system
china regards taiwan as one of its provinces the mainland and the island of taiwan have been ruled separately since the end of the chinese civil war in 1949 beijing demands that they be reunited eventually and has long threatened to use military force if taiwan declares independence
a couple who said their son's broken bones were caused by brittle bone disease have worked out a deal with prosecutors to keep custody of their son if he remains healthy
wally hines iii 31 and debby hines 32 fled minnesota nine months ago after being accused of causing their son's injuries the couple returned with their 18-month-old son wyatt on wednesday and appeared in court friday they were released without bail and allowed to keep custody of their child
the parents were never charged with child abuse only with depriving the county of its custodial rights and federal charges of interstate flight to avoid prosecution the federal charges are being dropped
the state charges will be dismissed oct 30 if the parents stay out of trouble with the law continue to cooperate with authorities on care for the child and if the boy remains in good health dakota county attorney james backstrom said the agreement includes continued involvement by social service workers and juvenile court supervision
they're very happy they wanted to come home said john whitehead president of the rutherford institute a charlottesville va-based legal advocacy group that helped negotiate their return
i think they feel that things have worked out about as well as could be expected said wally hines jr wyatt's grandfather i didn't think they would have come back otherwise to tell you the truth
the hineses and their defenders have always denied that wyatt was the victim of abuse and maintained that authorities overreacted to his injuries
the family says wyatt suffers from osteogenesis imperfecta a genetic disease that affects some 20000 to 50000 americans or about 1 in 20000 they say that's what explains the broken leg and broken ribs that first brought wyatt to authorities' attention
because of the gag order it was unclear if prosecutors were still disputing the diagnosis social workers have said they thought the injuries were caused by the parents
officials with the osteogenesis imperfecta foundation in gaithersburg md say it's common for social workers to conclude that children are victims of abuse when they're really victims of oi and that the condition can be difficult to diagnose
wyatt's problems were first noticed when he was just 6 weeks old and his parents took him to a doctor with a swollen leg x-rays showed that his femur was broken in two places when child protection workers ordered more x-rays doctors found six broken ribs and wyatt was put in foster care for three months where he suffered more fractures
the couple got wyatt back when they agreed to a deal that required the father to live away from their home for four weeks shortly before a final hearing in may wyatt's femur broke again and they fled april 27 after learning police were coming to take wyatt away because of the injury
an american airlines jet that crashed off the end of a wet runway in a storm could have landed safely if all its braking systems had worked properly aviation experts testified friday
instead flight 1420 left the runway still going about 100 mph then hit a metal lighting structure broke apart and caught fire eleven people died in the june 1 crash at the little rock airport including the pilot
the mcdonnell-douglas md-82 landed in heavy rain and 25 mph crosswinds but that alone was not enough to cause it to run off the runway according to boeing corp tests exhibited at a national transportation safety board hearing
the plane's braking was hindered because it did not use its spoilers - wing panels that help deceleration by putting more weight on the wheels said thomas yager a nasa research engineer who specializes in runway braking
with spoilers 80 percent of the plane's weight is placed on a plane's main landing gear said cj turner a boeing engineer boeing now owns mcdonnell-douglas
without spoilers less than 30 percent of the weight remains on the main landing gear making it much more difficult to brake turner said in a crosswind - as was the case with the accident - without spoilers the main landing gear will bear just 7 percent of the load
the flight recorders indicated that the spoilers did not deploy but it was unclear whether the crew failed to set them or whether there was a mechanical problem
co-pilot michael origel has testified that he believed chief pilot richard buschmann set the spoilers to deploy automatically upon landing but origel whose duty it was to confirm the task said he could not recall the position of the spoiler handle before the accident
instances in which spoilers have not deployed when properly set are very rare said robert baker vice chairman of american airlines' parent company amr corp
the deceleration of flight 1420 was also impeded because the pilots did not apply wheel brakes until 11 seconds after touchdown - choosing to use manual brakes instead of brakes that deploy automatically
part of the reason for the braking delay was that the chief pilot was trying to straighten the plane after an off-center touchdown
representatives of american airlines and its pilots union questioned whether a flooded runway could have also affected the landing
but yager said runway markings showed no evidence of hydroplaning and that the runway was of the highest quality with good traction and drainage he said the plane's tire treads also were good
the runway itself was not at fault yager said
also testifying was stephanie manus who said a child-restraint seat saved her 18-month-old daughter's life in the crash she urged that the use of such seats be made a requirement
when we're about to land they advise us to put away our laptops and the reason is you cannot safely hold on to those items in an unexpected situation mrs manus said our children are much more precious than a laptop computer and something has got to be done about this
in december the federal aviation administration said it would begin writing a rule to create standards for child-restraint seats on airplanes ntsb chairman james hall told mrs manus he supported the change
a russian official at the center of a kremlin corruption scandal said friday that he wouldn't rule out going to switzerland to answer an arrest warrant charging him with money-laundering
swiss judge daniel devaud said friday that he had issued the warrant charging former kremlin property manager pavel borodin of laundering money through swiss banks
borodin said friday that he hadn't seen the warrant and that he would have to examine it carefully but that he would consider going to switzerland he denied the charges
i respect switzerland mountains and all other stuff he said jokingly
devaud said he could not ask russia to extradite a russian citizen but he could be arrested if he traveled to western countries there was no indication friday that russian authorities would turn borodin over to the swiss prosecutors
borodin served as kremlin property manager for seven years under former president boris yeltsin and presided over the kremlin business empire including government buildings resorts hotels planes and numerous other assets worth approximately several billion dollars
the south carolina legislature has taken issue with media reports of a mass slaying of korean civilians by us forces during the korean war
the reports are capable of being used by the enemies of the united states and detractors of the armed forces of the united states to blemish the heroism and distinguished record of the one and one-half million men and women who served as soldiers sailors marines and airmen in the armed forces of the united states during the korean war reads a house resolution passed this week on a voice vote
the associated press citing dozens of villagers and us veterans reported in september that hundreds of korean civilians were killed at no gun ri by american soldiers who feared north korean soldiers were infiltrating groups of refugees
the united states and south korea previously dismissed the claims but opened investigations after the ap report was published
a man and his parents have been arrested in the 1996 slaying of his ex-wife whose dismembered body was found floating in a lake by fishermen
macon county state's attorney lawrence fichter would not talk about a possible motive or who he thinks fired the shots that killed the 23-year-old karyn hearn slover she was shot five times in the head
slover's ex-husband and former in-laws were arrested thursday hours after the third grand jury to consider the case returned indictments against all three for first-degree murder
grand jury documents allege michael k slover jr 29 and his parents michael k slover sr 53 and jeanette slover 52 intentionally shot and killed karyn slover the indictments also charge that the two slover men tried to conceal the crime by cutting burning and destroying the woman's body
all three were arrested without incident illinois state police sgt rory steidl said
fichter said he would ask the judge to deny bond and keep all three in jail until trial
attorney sam cahnman who represented slover jr during the grand jury proceedings said friday to the best of my knowledge my client is not guilty
calls to the office of the attorney representing the parents were not answered
karyn slover vanished sept 27 1996 she was last seen by co-workers at the decatur herald &amp review where she worked in the newspaper's advertising department she left the newspaper that day to pick up her 3-year-old son at her in-laws' home she was never heard from again
the car she was driving was found that night abandoned with the engine running 29 miles northeast of decatur on interstate 72 two days later fishermen found parts of her dismembered body in plastic bags in lake shelbyville - 41 miles away from where the car was left
friends and family were stunned and the case gripped the community a sickening feeling lingered for years at the newspaper office said human resources manager terri kuhle
you had highs and lows in the investigation then you wait and nothing happens kuhle said
major crimes dropped 127 percent in 1999 to the lowest recorded number in the city since 1971 police said friday
the 101552 serious crimes recorded last year from january through december are the lowest since the city began reporting the numbers to the fbi police chief benny napoleon said
this is a one-year phenomenal reduction he said there were 116322 serious crimes recorded in 1998
after surging in the first half of the year homicides were down 3 percent overall to 416 the figures show larcenies were down 185 percent while burglaries dropped 143 percent
my goal is to have detroit consistently out of the top 30 when it comes to its violent crime rate napoleon said
mayor dennis archer said the drop should be noticed by businesses and serve as a benchmark for the city
making people feel safe was among archer's chief goals when he took office in 1994 and since then the overall crime rate has gone down mirroring a national trend
prosecutors have agreed to drop their case against the owners of a 150-pound pet chimp named moe but he will remain in custody until a civil lawsuit is settled
and if he ever comes back to town said martin j mayer the city's chief prosecutor his surrogate parents ladonna and st james davis can expect to find themselves back in court again
the city's civil lawsuit seeks a permanent injunction against the davises barring moe from the city a court date has not been set yet
even though moe has bitten two people in two years city prosecutors dropped their criminal case against the davises this week west covina police chief frank wills said friday
at a news conference with his wife and a few supporters davis said it was a relief not to face criminal charges and thanked more than 24000 people who he said have signed a petition demanding moe's return
davis holding a sign saying no moe red tape insisted moe isn't a public safety threat and he has bitten people only when provoked
animals bite people bite mike tyson bites so what he asked at the friday news conference
but in a phone interview mayer disagreed
the chimpanzee is not a cute little monkey mayer said adding that the 5-foot-tall moe has 1200 pounds of crushing power in each of his arms and used that strength two years ago to beat a police officer who answered a disturbance call
the couple has spent tens of thousands of dollars since september fighting to get back the primate who lived with them in west covina 25 miles east of los angeles for more than 30 years
wills said prosecutors decided to drop the criminal case after the animal legal defense fund agreed last weekend to mediate on behalf of moe in the civil case the defense fund works nationally to defend animals against abuse and exploitation
moe was something of a local celebrity before he was hauled off to quarantine in september appearing at ribbon cuttings and helping to sell girl scout cookies
a mobster who died while serving time for drug trafficking got the last laugh - with his obituary
saul kane 65 a former associate of nicodemo little nicky scarfo died jan 20 of respiratory problems linked to a heart condition
kane who was serving a 25-year prison term in lexington ky had his family deliver a death notice the newspapers couldn't refuse it listed the imprisoned scarfo as his brother and scarfo's son as one of his own sons the notice was published saturday in the philadelphia inquirer and the press of atlantic city
listing scarfo as a relative was kane's way of pointing up his loyalty according to an unidentified investigator quoted by the inquirer
kane was convicted in the drug case in 1987 and sentenced to 95 years in prison in part because he refused to give authorities information about scarfo the sentence was later reduced
what he's saying is that he was loyal to the end the investigator said what he's saying is that unlike some others he wasn't a rat
kane had always had a reputation as a wiseguy even among his fellow wiseguys
he operated an atlantic city lounge called the my way - as in the frank sinatra song when law enforcement investigators identified the my way as a mob hangout in the late 1970s kane took out an advertisement in the press saying come meet the mob at the my way
the bottom line is he got the last laugh from the grave he was still busting mob informant george fresolone said in tuesday's inquirer

vice president al gore has pulled ahead of bill bradley in new hampshire polls with a surge of support from men independents and registered democrats bradley was working to reverse the trend with aggressive campaigning
with four days left until the first-in-the-nation primary gore appears to have gotten a boost from his strong campaign in iowa which resulted in a decisive win monday
a dartmouth college-associated press poll released friday gives gore a 54 percent to 40 percent lead over bradley
the poll was conducted sunday through wednesday in the days just before and after gore's victory in the iowa caucuses gore was moving up in many polls before his caucus win
a tracking poll released friday night by the university of new hampshire for wmur and fox news gave gore a 13-point lead 54-41 the cnn-usa today-gallup tracking poll out friday night gave gore a 16-point lead 56-40 both polls had an error margin of plus or minus 5 percentage points for the democrats
the last dartmouth-ap poll two weeks ago had bradley at 49 percent and gore at 43 a slight edge for bradley
in the republican race the latest dartmouth-ap poll had john mccain in a virtual tie with george w bush 37 percent to 34 percent publisher steve forbes had 15 percent in the dartmouth-ap poll two weeks ago mccain had 42 points bush 33 and forbes 11
mccain has a narrow lead in some polls based on his strength among independents bush's chance to catch him may depend on his ability to win over undecided republicans despite competition for their votes from conservatives forbes and alan keyes veteran pollsters say
the cnn-usa today-gallup poll taken tuesday through thursday out friday night had the two about even bush at 37 percent and mccain at 36 percent with an error margin of 4 percentage points the university of new hampshire-wmur-fox tracking poll taken monday through thursday gave mccain a 40-33 edge just outside the poll's 4-point error margin
the dartmouth-ap poll of 365 likely voters in the democratic primary and 435 likely voters in the republican primary had an error margin of plus or minus 5 percentage points
linda fowler director of the rockefeller center polling institute at dartmouth college in hanover said gore's campaign has improved democrats who previously doubted whether he could win in november now think gore has a better chance she said
gore looks much more poised fowler said he's much clearer in terms of his message he's less jittery he looks more in control
that's reflected in poll numbers that showed likely voters saying gore is more likely to provide strong leadership than bradley they also said gore is much more likely to win both the new hampshire primary and november's general election bradley still has an edge in trustworthiness
bradley had drawn much of his strength from independents and men but the dartmouth-ap poll shows gore has surged among men and has regained an earlier advantage among women
two weeks ago 56 percent of men supported bradley and 38 percent backed gore in the dartmouth-ap but in the latest poll 51 percent of men are backing gore while 41 percent supported bradley
on the republican side mccain still ranks significantly higher than bush on voter perceptions that he is trustworthy and a strong leader but voters also think bush is more likely to prevail in the new hampshire primary and win the presidency in november
though supporters' views seemed decidedly mixed bill bradley kept up his aggressive criticism of al gore on friday questioning his democratic rival's truthfulness and portraying him as the kind of politician who uses words in a very tricky manner
you have to look at every word and every clause bradley said in a comment echoing accusations that critics made about president clinton during the lewinsky investigation
taking the stage after gore on friday night at a dinner benefiting the new hampshire democratic party bradley turned the heat on his opponent even hotter we have to face up to the fund-raising scandals of 1996 bradley said hoping to remind democrats of gore's central role in that controversy if we don't clean our house the republicans will clean it for us in the fall
some bradley supporters have said his new more confrontational campaign style has made them uncomfortable and one questioned him about it face to face
how can you deal with the sleaze factor without yourself going through the same type of tactic asked sonia sheridan who said she was troubled by the new approach
i think you make a very good point said bradley when someone misrepresents your position as al gore has done consistently in this campaign you call them on it
with polls showing gore with an apparent lead just days before tuesday's new hampshire primary bradley aides said he would continue his new tack
as voters make up their mind this weekend we want to make sure they are aware of the differences said aide anita dunn
sheridan the supporter who questioned bradley wasn't sure how the former senator should respond to gore's criticism
i don't know what he should do so that's why i asked him she said as for negative campaigning she said i certainly don't like that tactic but gore seems to be zooming because of it
other bradley supporters at campaign events friday were less than enthusiastic about his new approach
it makes me uncomfortable said belinda glennie i'd rather see him be the egghead he is
i've heard good reviews and i've heard bad reviews said nick hanlon who attended a rally in newport i hope it doesn't turn people off
unfazed bradley argued at rally after rally that gore makes campaign promises designed to be evasive or to mislead on issues ranging from gun control to health care to abortion rights
for example bradley said gore talks about favoring licensing of handguns but actually favors licensing of new handguns only
the problem is not new handguns the problem is all handguns bradley said
gore said little in response i'm going to emphasize the positive the vice president said as he arrived in portsmouth from his brief return to washington for clinton's state of the union address
i'm not going to get down to that level i'm going to continue to emphasize a positive agenda he said later in an interview with wnds-tv
accompanied by former treasury secretary robert rubin gore stuck to his day's message - that he is the only presidential candidate with the know-how to keep the economy on track
we have just begun to prosper he declared
also on a positive note his campaign previewed for reporters a 30-minute ad it will air on new hampshire television saturday besides commercials that have already been running it includes new scenes - gore playing frisbee with his wife and dancing with his daughter at her wedding - showing him as a loving husband and father
among the people at gore's portsmouth event bradley's recent criticism seemed to have made an impact
at the northern research and engineering corp engineer dave glista a democrat from durham said he was undecided but leaning toward bradley even though his priority issues - the economy and urban sprawl - should put him in gore's camp
everyone says clinton is the king of smooth talking and political talking i'm sure gore has picked up some of that so i would be more leery of what he says glista said
for his part gore accuses bradley of negative campaigning sparked by desperation
undecided democrat amos johnson had her own doubts
i'm more interested in the issues ms johnson said this is a bit abrasive we're going to go see al gore tomorrow and we'll make up our mind
along the way friday bradley collected the endorsement of connecticut gov lowell weicker weicker was a republican senator before winning the governor's office as an independent
one of bradley's strengths is his appeal to independent voters and he was hoping to use weicker's backing to score points with independents on tuesday
weicker aimed his pitch in their direction the only independent thinker and actor out there is bill bradley

chinese authorities freed a us college librarian on friday five months after they arrested him on charges of smuggling secret documents out of the country us and chinese officials said here
song yongyi who works at dickinson college in carlisle pa was scheduled to arrive in philadelphia on saturday afternoon
state department spokesman james foley said the us government was pleased by china's decision but did not believe there was any evidence to warrant his detention
however china's ambassador to the united states said in a statement that song admitted all the facts related to his criminal activities and also voluntarily revealed evidence against illegal activities of others
song's case was treated with leniency because of his repentance said the ambassador li zhao xing
song a 50-year-old chinese national who had planned to become a us citizen in september was on a trip to china in august to collect source material on the 1966-76 cultural revolution when he and his wife helen yao were detained his wife was allowed to return to the united states in november
dickinson officials have said song was collecting previously published material to bring to the united states but the chinese contended he was purchasing or illegally supplying intelligence to people outside china
foley cited the efforts of secretary of state madeleine k albright sen arlen specter r-pa and several congressional delegations that visited china for pressuring the chinese government to release song
specter said he learned of song's release during a meeting with li at the chinese embassy in washington on friday morning he said he believes chinese authorities released song to curry favor with congress which will decide whether to grant china permanent normal trade relations formerly known as most-favored-nation trading status
they know they'll need our votes said specter who declined to comment on song's alleged confession
contacted at home by the associated press song's wife yao said he called me and said he was free today is a very exciting day she said the state department told her song would arrive in detroit on saturday
in beijing a us official said song left saturday on a northwest flight to detroit
us ambassador to china james prueher said he hoped song's release would be a harbinger of continued open academic research in china and of broader discussions with the chinese government on related issues prueher said in a statement he was delighted for song yongyi and his family
dickinson president william durden said he was appreciative of the actions of the chinese government and look forward to his return to his family and our campus durden also declined to comment on the confession but called the release a victory for academic freedom
song is an expert on documents about the cultural revolution when millions in china were persecuted as mao tse-tung sought to consolidate his power the communist government continues to regard the period as extremely sensitive and heavily restricts access to archived material about it
just before the new hampshire primary former sen bill bradley reported friday that his campaign bank account is up to $20 million his opponent vice president al gore has a little more than $11 million on hand
bradley finished 1999 with more than $83 million in the bank and expects an additional $114 million in federal matching funds the federal government matches the first $250 of each individual contribution for presidential candidates who agree to limit their campaign spending
overall the bradley campaign reported raising more than $27 million through dec 31 compared with $28 million for his rival gore final numbers are due monday
we always planned to run a national campaign and as a result of the overwhelming support we have received at the grass-roots level we will have the resources to compete throughout the entire nominating process campaign chairman douglas berman said
helping bradley's fund raising is the money he has brought in through his web site the campaign said it had raised more than $250000 this month via the internet bringing its online total to more than $16 million
though he trails in national opinion polls bradley has been able to match gore in fund raising gore reported having $112 million in the bank as of jan 3 and has requested $124 million in federal funds
gore also has raised an additional $27 million to pay legal and accounting costs for the general election

outside the georgia dome workers unloaded the giant mounds of sand they might need to keep the ramps and entryways from becoming too slick on super bowl sunday
at the entrance to the delta airlines terminal at the airport a huge scratchpad sitting on an easel spelled out the growing list of flights into atlanta that had already been canceled
only one thing was missing as midnight approached in chilly atlanta on friday
snow
indeed it seemed the winter storm making its way across the southeast was taking on characteristics of the game itself sometimes the buildup is more frenzied than the main event
i walked outside earlier today and it was really pretty nice nfl vice president of special events jim steeg said noting cloudy skies still winds and temperatures in the mid-30s we're ready for whatever comes the forecast seems to be changing by the minute
late friday night a light mist of freezing rain fell on atlanta the national weather service backed off on its forecast of snow but said the freezing rain could continue into saturday
if the worst hits it could be the kind of storm that might normally stop hotlanta in its tracks
if anything is still running however it figures to be the super bowl
we feel like we're prepared steeg said it's a matter of flexibility we need to be able to adjust to circumstances depending on what the weather brings
some of the adjustments have included
rescheduling a rehearsal for the pregame show in the georgia dome so both teams could hold their final full practices indoors friday
stationing workers on the georgia dome roof to brush off snow or excess water should it accumulate
making sure all the food and drinks arrive at the stadium early to prevent delivery trucks from having to negotiate slick roads
placing 16 power generators at the georgia dome to provide emergency energy should ice and snow knock out power to the downtown area
james peters of georgia power says downtown atlanta is networked for power underground
it's very very rare that an outage occurs peters said if an outage does occur we do have contingency plans in place
travelers were searching for backup plans as well
delta canceled four flights from nashville to atlanta airline officials said they canceled the flights to prevent a worse backlog in case it snowed
the decision left travel agencies in tennessee scrambling
it doesn't make a whole lot of sense to me said suzette bertuccelli manager of embassy travel in nashville they usually don't cancel until inclement weather hits we've just gotten a couple of calls this morning from people wanting to get protected on another flight
she said other airlines were still flying between the two cities but those flights are completely booked
in st louis susan dibb of lesterville mo climbed aboard a chartered plane friday morning and felt fortunate to be on an early flight out
i don't care if it's got eight inches after we get there because we're going to the super bowl she said i'm very excited
reservation managers at two large downtown hotels the hyatt and marriott said the number of room cancellations through friday had been negligible
the nfl has no plans to redistribute tickets that aren't picked up
the league isn't really in a position to do that steeg said now if coke learns that half its group isn't going to make it in it's their decision
but steeg doesn't anticipate seeing a half-empty georgia dome come sunday
he recalled the 1987 super bowl when the giants played the broncos in pasadena calif and a giant snowstorm closed airports in the new york area in the days leading up to the game
everyone still made it out there steeg said everyone has four days to make it to the game they don't have any other meetings to go to until the big one at 6 o'clock sunday if they can make it here by then they're good then the big issue becomes what's the weather going to be like monday when everyone is going home

calling the mother of elian gonzalez an excellent girl president fidel castro said friday she had been practically kidnapped by the boyfriend who perished along with her on the boat wreck her 6-year-old son survived
castro's remarks to a conference of economists were aimed at those who say that elian should remain in the united states because his mother sacrificed his life to take her to freedom a vision he called a cliche
he placed the blame on lazaro rafael munero who apparently organized the ill-fated journey on which elian's mother elisabeth brotons and 10 other people - including munero - died
castro called munero - who reportedly drove a taxi and engaged in unofficial businesses in the cuban city of cardenas - a ruffian on whom cuban police had amassed 100 pages of reports
according to sources quoted by the miami herald munero had fled to florida in june 1998 and returned to cuba later that year only to be jailed for several months
the mother was practically kidnapped along with the boy to make the late-november trip castro said
the cuban leader said elian had been especially loved by his parents because the mother had earlier suffered seven miscarriages
earlier friday cuba's communist government celebrated the birth of independence hero jose marti on friday with rallies calling for the return of elian gonzalez the boy martyr at the center of an international custody battle
tens of thousands of children flooded havana's plaza of the revolution to deliver a dual homage to marti and elian the 6-year-old cuban whose rescue off florida's coast two months ago set off a tug-of-war between relatives living on both sides of the florida straits
wearing their red communist pioneer neckerchiefs a string of young boys and girls recited poems they wrote for elian dubbed cuba's boy hero and symbolic child and for marti commonly known on the island as cuba's teacher and apostle
the communist party daily granma compared elian with revolutionary icon ernesto che guevara and said the boy has been converted forever into a symbol of the crimes and injustices that imperialism is capable of committing against an innocent
the commemorations were similar to those held here annually for marti the revolutionary and poet who fought for cuba's independence from spain in 1898 but this year children wore t-shirts bearing elian's portrait with their school uniforms
the commemorations began early friday morning as tens of thousands of cubans marched through havana's streets by torchlight similar events were held all day in the capital and across the island
in old havana hundreds of children marched around the parque central chanting we will save elian a small group of girls wore construction paper handcuffs - an apparent reference to the government's characterization of elian's retention in the united states as a kidnapping
fidel castro's government has been using such traditional political events - along with other rallies almost every day - to draw attention to the case of elian who was rescued nov 25 while clinging to an inner tube his mother and 10 others died at sea while trying to reach the united states
for the past two months elian's father has demanded that the boy be returned to him in cuba and the us government has said that father and son should be reunited
but elian's paternal great-uncle in the united states backed by the anti-castro cuban american national foundation is fighting in the courts to keep the boy in miami

a storm spread still more snow across the deep south on friday giving children from arkansas to georgia a rare chance to build snowmen but threatening travel to the super bowl
the storm which dumped up to 17 inches of snow in oklahoma earlier this week dropped between an inch and a foot in arkansas mississippi alabama and tennessee before stalling near the alabama-georgia line for most of the day friday
as midnight approached however the storm was moving through northern georgia national weather service meteorologist terry murphy said
areas in north georgia and parts of central georgia got snow sleet and freezing rain he said icy rain fell on northeastern alabama rain fell on atlanta and snow started falling in western south carolina

as a precaution delta air lines canceled some flights into atlanta friday afternoon but promised to accommodate passengers trying to get to the super bowl more than 100000 people are expected in atlanta for the game between the tennessee titans and the st louis rams
we want the customers to get down there to the super bowl said john farmer delta station manager in nashville tenn we'll work with them any way we can to get them there by kickoff
todd benson 28 of kansas city mo managed to beat the storm and arrive at the atlanta airport friday i feel very lucky that we made it here that the flight did not get canceled he said

rock star melissa etheridge joined the battle against a ballot measure aimed at banning state recognition of same-sex marriages saying on friday that the proposal was fueled by hate and bigotry
there are hundreds and thousands of people that i represent that are just like me that don't happen to have two grammys that this affects and this affects me deeply said etheridge who is gay
proposition 22 which appears on the march 7 ballot would prohibit california from granting legal recognition to same-sex marriages that are legally performed in other states state law currently recognizes only marriage between a man and a woman
joining etheridge at a news conference was judy shepard whose son matthew was beaten tied to a fence and left to die outside laramie wyo in october 1998 his attackers have since been sentenced to life in prison
mrs shepard said the initiative indirectly relates to the death of her 21-year-old son who was killed because he was gay
what it does is create a climate where such actions are viewed as acceptable she said
etheridge added that the measure is not about telling gay people they can't be married because california law already prohibits such that
what proposition 22 does is tell me my partner my children that we are less than my neighbor said the musician who is raising a 3-year-old daughter and 1-year-old son with partner julie cypher a filmmaker
a posse of pigeon rustlers or inhumane cowboys loose in the neighborhood how an armed animal control squad is viewed in buffalo depends on where you stand on animal rights or where you sit
everyday in the spring i'm hosing my driveway and scraping my windshield said ann marie cortese of north buffalo those birds make me have extra work
the city's animal control squad and is armed daily with poison traps and 22-caliber rifles to handle residents' complaints about unwanted wildlife
the common council is now considering a request to hire two more officers to the six-member pest control squad
they are a bunch of inhumane cowboys enjoying target practice on taxpayer dollars said stephanie boyles wildlife biologist for people for the ethical treatment of animals residents who like pigeons or those who just don't want bullets flying down their street shouldn't be paying for this
mayoral spokesperson peter cutler said that peta's letter demanding the hunt to be stopped and suggested options will be taken seriously
we're concerned for the health and safety of all residents so we need to watch out for disease but on the same token we don't want anybody harmed while these guys are out there cutler said he said the rifles are used in the most extreme circumstances
we'll give serious review to other methods and take the most appropriate action he said
the group learned of the practice through a buffalo news article officials weren't sure how long the shooting has been going on shooting nuisance birds by government officials has been practiced in other cities nationwide shooting within city limits would be illegal in most municipalities if done by private citizens
sharpshooters are ready each weekday to get rid of the unwanted birds frank poincelot the city's head pest-control and wildlife officer told the buffalo news that on a good day they the pest-control officers could go through 50 or 60 rounds of ammunition
that means 50 to 60 dead birds because officials insist the crew doesn't miss its shots which are often at birds perched on roof peaks of single- and two-family houses although a 22-caliber bullet can travel a mile or more and potentially through a bird animal control officials said the shooting isn't a threat to people most bird hunting is done with shotguns not 22 caliber rifles
residents complain about the droppings left by roosting pigeons some fear the spread of disease but most just don't like cleaning up the mess
pigeons have been accused of spreading everything from salmonella to meningitis and tuberculosis
peta's website charges that pest control companies have spread the misconception that urban pigeons spread disease the vast majority of people are at little health risk from pigeons and have a better chance of getting struck by lighting the organization writes
ms boyles concedes that the droppings can be a nuisance sure they are annoying but only effective methods will get rid of them she said when you kill a bird the only thing that'll happen is that another will take its place
peta suggests that homeowners and building managers should take measures to make the roosting site less hospitable in the first place tying up wind chimes playing a radio putting up effigies of predator birds or flying a balloon with big eyes drawn on it have all proven effective according to peta
people feed the birds or leave their trash out attracting them ms boyles said and then the birds are shot at paying for our irresponsibility
hillary rodham clinton has written to a top jewish leader to express her opposition to joerg haider and his far-right freedom party becoming part of a coalition government in austria
the move friday served to call attention once again to the fact that her expected republican senate opponent new york city mayor rudolph giuliani had shared the dais with haider at a martin luther king day event earlier this month
haider is a controversial figure who once praised adolf hitler's orderly employment practices and later said veterans of hitler's elite waffen ss were decent people of good character
giuliani aides had said at the time that the mayor had not been aware that haider was at the event
in a letter to edgar bronfman president of the world jewish congress mrs clinton said haider's record of intolerance extremism and anti-semitism should be of concern to all of us
neither he nor his party should be seriously considered as a partner in an austrian government the first lady added
surely the history of the past century tells us the danger of such a move i hope that people of good will in austria and around the world will speak out and express their concern at this important moment mrs clinton wrote i certainly will
there has been an international outcry including sharp criticism from israeli leaders in the wake of news that the center-right austrian people's party was talking with the freedom party about forming a governing coalition
the clinton camp left no doubt that the letter to bronfman was meant to put giuliani on the spot but campaign aides to the mayor refused to comment
it's been nearly two weeks since rudy giuliani shared a dais with joerg haider why hasn't he spoken out howard wolfson a spokesman for mrs clinton said why didn't he throw joerg haider out of the room
the mayor created an international stir when he threw palestinian leader yasser arafat out of a lincoln center concert celebrating the united nations' 50th anniversary in 1995
at the time giuliani blamed the palestine liberation organization for the murder of new yorker leon klinghoffer during the hijacking of the achille lauro cruise liner in 1985
when we're having a party and a celebration i would rather not have someone who was implicated in the murders of americans there giuliani had said
the clinton campaign's move also seemed designed to score points with the state's politically important jewish community the first lady and the mayor have been jockeying over that for months
giuliani had blasted mrs clinton for her embrace of arafat's wife last year just moments after she had charged that israel was using poison gas against palestinians the first lady later condemned mrs arafat's statements
the mayor's camp was also critical of mrs clinton's appearance at a martin luther king day event this month hosted by al sharpton during the event a sharpton ally had made remarks considered anti-semitic neither mrs clinton nor sharpton were in the room at the time the first lady subsequently criticized the comments
someone is tarnishing robert c smith's good name
and in at least some instances it's smith's good friend say police
at least five times in the past two years area police have wrongly filed charges against the 20-year-old syracuse man after catching someone who claimed to be him
attorneys for the real robert smith have managed to get the charges dismissed but the mistakes resulted in new york suspending smith's license warrants being issued for his arrest and smith having to appear in court on several occasions
the most recent episode occurred last weekend when police arrested five men on felony drug charges after finding them in possession of 11 ounces of crack cocaine
it turned out the person who gave smith's name was jeffrey dowdell jr 21 who has been friends with smith since the attended elementary school together in liverpool
dowdell did not have any identification when he was arrested but provided deputies with smith's correct date of birth and address said john d'eredita spokesman for the onondaga county sheriff's department at the jail however a deputy recognized him as dowdell d'eredita said
the deception earned dowdell an extra charge criminal impersonation a misdemeanor
smith's mother celestine smith said she doubted her son will remain friends with dowdell
he's tired of being dragged through the mud and being in court all the time being deaf is hard enough said mrs smith of her son who lost his hearing three years ago after contracting meningitis
they were friends since the time they were 9 years old but he can't be too much of our friend if he's doing this to us she said
smith did not want to talk about the affair
dowdell though maintained that smith was his friend and said he was sorry
i know my man robert i know he's mad at me but he'll get over it that's my man dowdell said in a jailhouse interview with the post-standard of syracuse
celestine smith said dowdell admitted to her this summer that he had pretended to be her son on a previous occasion when he was stopped by police
he said he didn't think robert would get in trouble because he can't hear said mrs smith
dowdell admitted monday that he told police he was smith last fall when they confiscated $1000 from him because he was in a drug-infested neighborhood and had no proof he had legally earned the money
however dowdell said he never got any tickets in smith's name
but syracuse police issued three separate appearance tickets in smith's name to an impersonator said attorney december haab who represented smith
the appearance tickets noted that the suspect had a scar on his face and a tattoo - which the real smith does not have haab said neither does dowdell
warrants were issued in 1999 for smith's arrest for failing to appear in court on a marijuana charge the warrants and charges were dismissed after haab met with prosecutors
suspects occasionally deceive police as to their true identity but are usually caught within hours after they are booked and fingerprinted authorities said
i think it's unusual haab said of smith's predicament i hope it's unusual
annual toll hikes could be possible along the new york state thruway under a plan approved by the toll road's board of directors
the board voted to go forward with a previously unannounced plan to tie future toll increases on the thruway to the construction cost index which is an average of construction material and labor costs in 20 us cities
the first-year hike would be 18 percent effective june 1 according to thruway authority executive director john platt
tolls at the short-trip barriers around buffalo and new york city would not go up because they are rounded to the nearest quarter but virtually all other tolls on the ticketed part of the superhighway would go up by 18 percent rounded to the nearest nickel
thruway officials will hold four public hearings to gather comment on the toll-increase plan and finalize the plan this spring thruway spokeswoman anya frost said
platt insisted that no final decision has been made
it is not cast in stone at all he said friday night
the toll-hike plan once it became known friday received immediate criticism
the majority leader of the state senate joseph bruno cited such a hike as being in opposition to recent state efforts to cut taxes and other costs of doing business in the state
now is not the time for the thruway authority to impose a hidden tax on upstate businesses residents and commuters in the form of multiyear toll hikes bruno r-rensselaer said
if the senate majority wants to make money available for capital projects we'll be more than happy to discuss this alternative platt countered but otherwise we need to be able to have a hedge against the cost of construction
the state motor truck association blasted the authority for the secretive manner in which it voted to raise tolls and said it appeared there was nothing to prevent tolls from going up 3 percent every year if increases in the construction cost index allowed such hikes
as business people we would never increase our prices to our largest customers without first consulting with them grumbled the motor truck association's president bill joyce
it called on pataki to ask the thruway authority to reexamine its projected toll hike and to find other ways to fund improvements on the roadway
pataki spokesman michael mckeon refused to take a stance on the plan at this point it's just a proposal he said there's going to be public hearings we'll let the process move forward
tolls were last raised on the thruway the nation's longest toll road in 1988 in 1996 the thruway board backed away from a toll hike at the insistence of gov george pataki
there was little if any advance word that the board was contemplating a toll hike before thursday's meeting the press release issued by the authority afterward spoke of the agency funding $275 million in capital improvements this year not until the second page of the release did the authority refer to the adoption of a plan which could result in an annual toll hike - it called it an indexed toll adjustment plan - beginning june 1
under the $275 million in projects to be put out for bid this year by the thruway was work on the interstate 287 corridor around the tappan zee bridge and the syracuse inner harbor
both projects are among the transportation facilities the thruway has assumed authority for in recent years critics say the drain of these other endeavors have put additional financial burdens on the authority past that of maintaining the original toll highway between new york city and the pennsylvania border
the thruway authority's chairman louis tomson is a former deputy to pataki and was nominated by the governor to the thruway position it is unlikely that the thruway authority board would proceed with a toll hike plan without the prior knowledge of pataki's office
it's duck season in the north country just ask is it cold enough for ya and watch everybody duck
such mild banter is offered at some risk when the weather turns drastically un-mild like in this adirondack mountain village here mercury doesn't dip in january it disappears from the thermometer
how cold is it
it's so cold in saranac lake that gasoline in a car's tank can turn to jelly it's so cold that home heating pipes and toilet bowls are cracking open it's so cold that people mummify themselves in wool and fur before stepping outside
it's hard to breathe said heather tuttle a supervisor at the wawbeek hotel
saranac lake is a quaint village of about 5000 people tucked in the high peaks of the adirondacks not as celebrated or upscale as nearby lake placid the northern new york village still features a rustic charm accented by clapboard homes an old fashioned main street and a mountain lake
and being so high up temperatures far below zero are common temperatures dipped to the -20 to -30 range recently - or -60 with the wind chill even with cloud cover over the past few days temperatures have been as low as -15
it's getting to be so if its zero you feel warm and if it's 8 above you take off your jacket and leave it in the truck said bill decker owner of big d fuel
and when the temperatures nosedive the locals just deal with it
craig catalano manager of asplin tree farm had to go out friday to cut down two balsam fir trees to be shipped to glens falls how does he psyche himself to go out in the cold
he doesn't he just puts on a herd's worth of wool and does it
hopefully it will be quick and simple he said
catalano noted a big problem with the cold was getting the diesel tractors to start up even with electric heaters on the engine blocks fuel will sometimes coagulate in the line he said
andreas mowka said he routinely will plug in his family's three cars overnight but when it gets really cold - as it has a few times recently - he will get up at 3 am to run the cars for a half hour so they don't freeze up
while the cars are idling he'll make sure the horse's water doesn't ice up and stock his house's wood stove 15 face cords a winter then he goes back to bed
you're in a dreamlike state when you do this he said
people with weekend homes in the area have it tougher decker said that in the 24-hours since one home was checked the heating system sputtered out causing water in every pipe to freeze cracking radiators and toilet bowls
our technicians our boiler repairmen aren't getting a lot of sleep he said
saranac lake is not necessarily colder than other places in the adirondacks but it gets more attention because it is the lone federally maintained weather observation site in the area it's also the largest year-round population center within the 6-million-acre park
it sort of becomes representative of the adirondacks said national weather service meteorologist mike cempa
residents here know their hometown has a frosty reputation but they tend to shrug it off as the price for living in such a beautiful setting
mowka said he has lived as far afield as iran germany and long island but that saranac lake is the best and most beautiful
mary la rose a retiree who was looking out the window friday morning to watch chickadees flitting about her bird feeder said it's important to keep in mind the upsides of the area
we don't have hurricanes and floods so we have a little cold weather once in while she said that's not too bad

in the final hours of international talks friday on trade in genetically modified food and other products negotiators found themselves grappling over the same issues that doomed a similar agreement nearly a year ago
delegates scurried from room to room of the montreal hotel where the meeting was being held bearing proposals and counterproposals the shuttling delayed the start of a final plenary session for seven hours when it finally began just before midnight key us and european delegates were not present - still negotiating separately over their differences
mayr who set a deadline of friday night has said that he will not leave montreal without an agreement
somebody has to give in somewhere said ethiopian head delegate towalde egziabher
negotiators were attempting to draft the biosafety protocol a set of rules that would protect the environment from damage by genetically modified plants animals and bacteria environmentalists and a few scientific studies have raised concerns that genetically modified organisms could wipe out native species disrupt natural cycles and cause other ecological damage
there's fish genes in fruit poultry genes in fish animal genes in plants growth hormones in milk insect genes in vegetables tree genes in grain and in the case of pork human genes in meat said steve gilman an organic farmer in stillwater ny real and reasonable concerns about genetic engineering have fallen upon deaf ears
the debate at the talks has revolved around how great the scientific uncertainty is and how it should be dealt with the european union and developing nations have argued that countries should be allowed to decline imports of a genetically modified product if little is known about its environmental effect
but the united states and its partners disagree saying the proposed rules in their current form would restrict trade those countries argued that any nation's refusal to import a genetically modified product should be backed by scientific evidence in the form of a risk assessment
we live in a world in which scientific certainty is not available said us undersecretary of state frank loy
talks last february in cartagena colombia ended in disarray when the united states and five other countries - canada australia argentina chile and uruguay - rejected a draft agreement favored by 125 other countries
the situation has changed since then with major us food producers such as archer daniels midland gerber and the iams pet food company either demanding that genetically modified products be segregated or refusing to use them altogether protests at the world trade organization talks in seattle last month also suggest that the american public has concerns about genetically altered food
in the year since cartagena it has become obvious that the position of the united states' group is increasingly isolated said philip bereano a university of washington professor who has been following the talks
just as in cartagena the talks in montreal have come down to a handful of issues
the relationship of the proposed rules to the world trade organization the united states wants the agreement to have equal status with the free trade pact but other countries fear that any bans they impose will be overturned by the world trade organization's dispute resolution panel
the amount of scientific evidence that is needed to justify banning a genetically modified product
the amount of evidence that exporters must provide about their products
genetically modified crops are already widespread about 70 million acres of genetically engineered plants were cultivated worldwide in 1999 in the united states genetically engineered varieties account for about 25 percent of corn and 40 percent of soybeans

he's tired of being dragged through the mud and being in court all the time being deaf is hard enough said mrs smith of her son who lost his hearing three years ago after contracting meningitis
they were friends since the time they were 9 years old but he can't be too much of our friend if he's doing this to us she said
smith did not want to talk about the affair
dowdell though maintained that smith was his friend and said he was sorry
i know my man robert i know he's mad at me but he'll get over it that's my man dowdell said in a jailhouse interview with the post-standard of syracuse
celestine smith said dowdell admitted to her this summer that he had pretended to be her son on a previous occasion when he was stopped by police
he said he didn't think robert would get in trouble because he can't hear said mrs smith
dowdell admitted monday that he told police he was smith last fall when they confiscated $1000 from him because he was in a drug-infested neighborhood and had no proof he had legally earned the money
however dowdell said he never got any tickets in smith's name
but syracuse police issued three separate appearance tickets in smith's name to an impersonator said attorney december haab who represented smith
the appearance tickets noted that the suspect had a scar on his face and a tattoo - which the real smith does not have haab said neither does dowdell
warrants were issued in 1999 for smith's arrest for failing to appear in court on a marijuana charge the warrants and charges were dismissed after haab met with prosecutors
suspects occasionally deceive police as to their true identity but are usually caught within hours after they are booked and fingerprinted authorities said
i think it's unusual haab said of smith's predicament i hope it's unusual
annual toll hikes could be possible along the new york state thruway under a plan approved by the toll road's board of directors
the board voted to go forward with a previously unannounced plan to tie future toll increases on the thruway to the construction cost index which is an average of construction material and labor costs in 20 us cities
the first-year hike would be 18 percent effective june 1 according to thruway authority executive director john platt
tolls at the short-trip barriers around buffalo and new york city would not go up because they are rounded to the nearest quarter but virtually all other tolls on the ticketed part of the superhighway would go up by 18 percent rounded to the nearest nickel
thruway officials will hold four public hearings to gather comment on the toll-increase plan and finalize the plan this spring thruway spokeswoman anya frost said
platt insisted that no final decision has been made
it is not cast in stone at all he said friday night
the toll-hike plan once it became known friday received immediate criticism
the majority leader of the state senate joseph bruno cited such a hike as being in opposition to recent state efforts to cut taxes and other costs of doing business in the state
now is not the time for the thruway authority to impose a hidden tax on upstate businesses residents and commuters in the form of multiyear toll hikes bruno r-rensselaer said
if the senate majority wants to make money available for capital projects we'll be more than happy to discuss this alternative platt countered but otherwise we need to be able to have a hedge against the cost of construction
the state motor truck association blasted the authority for the secretive manner in which it voted to raise tolls and said it appeared there was nothing to prevent tolls from going up 3 percent every year if increases in the construction cost index allowed such hikes
as business people we would never increase our prices to our largest customers without first consulting with them grumbled the motor truck association's president bill joyce
it called on pataki to ask the thruway authority to reexamine its projected toll hike and to find other ways to fund improvements on the roadway
pataki spokesman michael mckeon refused to take a stance on the plan at this point it's just a proposal he said there's going to be public hearings we'll let the process move forward
tolls were last raised on the thruway the nation's longest toll road in 1988 in 1996 the thruway board backed away from a toll hike at the insistence of gov george pataki
there was little if any advance word that the board was contemplating a toll hike before thursday's meeting the press release issued by the authority afterward spoke of the agency funding $275 million in capital improvements this year not until the second page of the release did the authority refer to the adoption of a plan which could result in an annual toll hike - it called it an indexed toll adjustment plan - beginning june 1
under the $275 million in projects to be put out for bid this year by the thruway was work on the interstate 287 corridor around the tappan zee bridge and the syracuse inner harbor
both projects are among the transportation facilities the thruway has assumed authority for in recent years critics say the drain of these other endeavors have put additional financial burdens on the authority past that of maintaining the original toll highway between new york city and the pennsylvania border
the thruway authority's chairman louis tomson is a former deputy to pataki and was nominated by the governor to the thruway position it is unlikely that the thruway authority board would proceed with a toll hike plan without the prior knowledge of pataki's office
it's duck season in the north country just ask is it cold enough for ya and watch everybody duck
such mild banter is offered at some risk when the weather turns drastically un-mild like in this adirondack mountain village here mercury doesn't dip in january it disappears from the thermometer
how cold is it
it's so cold in saranac lake that gasoline in a car's tank can turn to jelly it's so cold that home heating pipes and toilet bowls are cracking open it's so cold that people mummify themselves in wool and fur before stepping outside
it's hard to breathe said heather tuttle a supervisor at the wawbeek hotel
saranac lake is a quaint village of about 5000 people tucked in the high peaks of the adirondacks not as celebrated or upscale as nearby lake placid the northern new york village still features a rustic charm accented by clapboard homes an old fashioned main street and a mountain lake
and being so high up temperatures far below zero are common temperatures dipped to the -20 to -30 range recently - or -60 with the wind chill even with cloud cover over the past few days temperatures have been as low as -15
it's getting to be so if its zero you feel warm and if it's 8 above you take off your jacket and leave it in the truck said bill decker owner of big d fuel
and when the temperatures nosedive the locals just deal with it
craig catalano manager of asplin tree farm had to go out friday to cut down two balsam fir trees to be shipped to glens falls how does he psyche himself to go out in the cold
he doesn't he just puts on a herd's worth of wool and does it
hopefully it will be quick and simple he said
catalano noted a big problem with the cold was getting the diesel tractors to start up even with electric heaters on the engine blocks fuel will sometimes coagulate in the line he said
andreas mowka said he routinely will plug in his family's three cars overnight but when it gets really cold - as it has a few times recently - he will get up at 3 am to run the cars for a half hour so they don't freeze up
while the cars are idling he'll make sure the horse's water doesn't ice up and stock his house's wood stove 15 face cords a winter then he goes back to bed
you're in a dreamlike state when you do this he said
people with weekend homes in the area have it tougher decker said that in the 24-hours since one home was checked the heating system sputtered out causing water in every pipe to freeze cracking radiators and toilet bowls
our technicians our boiler repairmen aren't getting a lot of sleep he said
saranac lake is not necessarily colder than other places in the adirondacks but it gets more attention because it is the lone federally maintained weather observation site in the area it's also the largest year-round population center within the 6-million-acre park
it sort of becomes representative of the adirondacks said national weather service meteorologist mike cempa
residents here know their hometown has a frosty reputation but they tend to shrug it off as the price for living in such a beautiful setting
mowka said he has lived as far afield as iran germany and long island but that saranac lake is the best and most beautiful
mary la rose a retiree who was looking out the window friday morning to watch chickadees flitting about her bird feeder said it's important to keep in mind the upsides of the area
we don't have hurricanes and floods so we have a little cold weather once in while she said that's not too bad
hundreds of riot police blocked mexico city streets friday to demand salary raises and other benefits clogging key thoroughfares and causing traffic jams that stretched for miles
from before the morning rush hour until the evening uniformed officers parked buses at intersections and erected barricades to block main thoroughfares wreaking havoc for commuters
the officers want 100 percent salary increases better equipment and benefits they also called for the dismissal of their commander the televisa network reported the officers withdrew their roadblocks late friday but continued to gather outside their headquarters demanding that officials negotiate with them
mexico city mayor rosario robles said the protest was unjustified but acknowledged that an accounting error had delayed paychecks for the officers the government news agency notimex reported she said the problem would be resolved by saturday
in the afternoon traffic was congested even further by another street protest by administrative workers from the autonomous university of chapingo the demonstrators who were demanding wage increases walked onto the main freeway that circles mexico city
for two hours the university workers blocked traffic in both directions on the perifico sur riot police who remained on duty during their colleagues' protest were called in to dislodge the workers notimex reported
though supporters' views seemed decidedly mixed bill bradley kept up his aggressive criticism of al gore on friday questioning his democratic rival's truthfulness and portraying him as the kind of politician who uses words in a very tricky manner
you have to look at every word and every clause bradley said in a comment echoing accusations that critics made about president clinton during the lewinsky investigation
taking the stage after gore on friday night at a dinner benefiting the new hampshire democratic party bradley turned the heat on his opponent even hotter we have to face up to the fund-raising scandals of 1996 bradley said hoping to remind democrats of gore's central role in that controversy if we don't clean our house the republicans will clean it for us in the fall
some bradley supporters have said his new more confrontational campaign style has made them uncomfortable and one questioned him about it face to face
how can you deal with the sleaze factor without yourself going through the same type of tactic asked sonia sheridan who said she was troubled by the new approach
i think you make a very good point said bradley when someone misrepresents your position as al gore has done consistently in this campaign you call them on it
with polls showing gore with an apparent lead just days before tuesday's new hampshire primary bradley aides said he would continue his new tack
as voters make up their mind this weekend we want to make sure they are aware of the differences said aide anita dunn
sheridan the supporter who questioned bradley wasn't sure how the former senator should respond to gore's criticism
i don't know what he should do so that's why i asked him she said as for negative campaigning she said i certainly don't like that tactic but gore seems to be zooming because of it
other bradley supporters at campaign events friday were less than enthusiastic about his new approach
it makes me uncomfortable said belinda glennie i'd rather see him be the egghead he is
i've heard good reviews and i've heard bad reviews said nick hanlon who attended a rally in newport i hope it doesn't turn people off
unfazed bradley argued at rally after rally that gore makes campaign promises designed to be evasive or to mislead on issues ranging from gun control to health care to abortion rights
for example bradley said gore talks about favoring licensing of handguns but actually favors licensing of new handguns only
the problem is not new handguns the problem is all handguns bradley said
gore said little in response i'm going to emphasize the positive the vice president said as he arrived in portsmouth from his brief return to washington for clinton's state of the union address
i'm not going to get down to that level i'm going to continue to emphasize a positive agenda he said later in an interview with wnds-tv
accompanied by former treasury secretary robert rubin gore stuck to his day's message - that he is the only presidential candidate with the know-how to keep the economy on track
we have just begun to prosper he declared
also on a positive note his campaign previewed for reporters a 30-minute ad it will air on new hampshire television saturday besides commercials that have already been running it includes new scenes - gore playing frisbee with his wife and dancing with his daughter at her wedding - showing him as a loving husband and father
among the people at gore's portsmouth event bradley's recent criticism seemed to have made an impact
at the northern research and engineering corp engineer dave glista a democrat from durham said he was undecided but leaning toward bradley even though his priority issues - the economy and urban sprawl - should put him in gore's camp
everyone says clinton is the king of smooth talking and political talking i'm sure gore has picked up some of that so i would be more leery of what he says glista said
for his part gore accuses bradley of negative campaigning sparked by desperation
undecided democrat amos johnson had her own doubts
i'm more interested in the issues ms johnson said this is a bit abrasive we're going to go see al gore tomorrow and we'll make up our mind
along the way friday bradley collected the endorsement of connecticut gov lowell weicker weicker was a republican senator before winning the governor's office as an independent
one of bradley's strengths is his appeal to independent voters and he was hoping to use weicker's backing to score points with independents on tuesday
weicker aimed his pitch in their direction the only independent thinker and actor out there is bill bradley

mark messier scored two goals for the first time in almost two years as the vancouver canucks snapped a six-game winless streak with a 4-1 victory over the san jose sharks on friday night
alexander mogilny back after missing seven games with an injury and donald brashear also scored for the canucks who ended an eight-game home winless slide dating back to dec 22 the win was also vancouver's first in eight meetings against san jose they were 0-4-3 against the sharks dating back to feb 7 1998
the sharks are 2-6-2 in their last 10 games
messier the nhl's leading active goal-scorer and points-producer - scored both of his goals on the power play marking his first multiple-goal performance since he scored twice in vancouver's 6-4 loss to ottawa on feb 28 1998 with nine goals on the season messier now has a career total of 619
san jose's todd harvey opened the scoring 28 seconds into the game messier's first goal put the canucks ahead for good breaking a 1-1 tie with 14 seconds left in the first period
mattias ohlund who had two assists set up the play going after his own rebound ohlund kicked the puck free to messier who waiting alone just left of the net flipped it in the open side
brashear made it 3-1 when he beat san jose goalie steve shields with a weak 40-footer with 251 left in the second period the goal ended shields night as he was pulled in favor of backup evgeni nabokov
shields who gave up three goals on 18 shots has struggled going 2-5-1 in his last eight starts
messier then sealed the victory when he flipped in a rebound off markus naslund's shot 548 into the third period
the game's momentum turned in the opening minutes when the sharks failed to capitalize on a two-minute two-man advantage the sharks managed just two shots on net over the two-minute span and to make matters worse mogilny wound up tying the game 35 seconds after the penalties expired
with mogilny back in the lineup the canucks sent down rookie steve kariya - younger brother of anaheim mighty ducks star paul kariya - to the syracuse crunch of the american hockey league earlier in the day after opening the season with six goals and 11 points in 20 games kariya had been held without a point in the last nine games he played
shaquille o'neal scored 26 of his 30 points in the first half friday night as the los angeles lakers ended their only two-game losing streak of the season with a 117-89 romp over the milwaukee bucks
kobe bryant added 23 points for los angeles which took control in the third quarter while the bucks could not find the basket
starting with 721 left in the third the bucks missed 19 consecutive shots during a 1425 span when they were outscored 35-9 and fell behind 108-77
sam cassell scored 18 for milwaukee and vinny del negro had 15 points off the bench
glen rice added 19 points for los angeles and ron harper had 10 assists
o'neal also blocked four shots and had eight rebounds and got a rare restful game playing just 33 minutes he went 13-of-18 from the floor
the bucks' most lopsided loss prior to the game was an 106-84 defeat at indiana
tom lehman cooled off just in time to put some suspense back into the phoenix open
lehman who shot an 8-under-par 63 in the first round and shared a three-stroke lead with phil mickelson going into the second followed up with a 67 friday
he plateaued after birdies on three of the first five holes allowing frank lickliter to stay within one stroke lehman finished with four straight pars holing out in deep twilight on no 18
my main objective on the 18th was just to make sure i finished strong lehman said because it was dark i didn't want to make a mistake i was very satisfied with a par there
lickliter carded a 64 reaching the midpoint at 11-under 131 and feeling confident about his chances of picking up what would be his first pga tour title
if i keep putting myself in this position rocco mediate keeps telling me i'll win by accident - i'll birdie the last three holes or someone will bogey the last three holes or something lickliter said i feel like i keep getting better every year
hal sutton robert allenby and bradley hughes were four shots off the pace at 134 with steve flesch and stewart cink were one shot behind them
mickelson who won the phoenix open four years ago shot 73 and backed into a five-way tie at 136 with tom pernice jr kenny perry paul stankowski and 1993 champion lee janzen
frost delayed the start of play for 30 minutes in the morning and darkness forced the suspension of play with 21 players still on the course
that kept the pga from announcing the cut pending completion of the round saturday morning
it was projected at 142 with 65 players who finished the round at par or lower
mediate 137 the defending champion 1998 winner jesper parnevik 138 and 1997 phoenix medalist steve jones 139 easily qualified to play the weekend
paul azinger the 1987 phoenix winner and the winner two weeks ago in honolulu was likely to miss the cut after rounds of 76 and 70
noted newcomers sergio garcia and gary nicklaus son of jack nicklaus also were at 146
lehman's approach shots were uncanny he had birdie putts of 8 10 and 10 feet on nos 2 3 and 5 birdied no 10 from four feet and got his fifth birdie on the 13th hole with an 8-foot putt
at the 14th hole he made his only bogey of the tournament after lofting an 8-iron to the back of the green leaving the chip five feet short and missing the par putt
i definitely feel like i'm in great position said lehman who won $1 million in the williams world challenge on jan 2 and tied for sixth in honolulu his only official pga event before this week
lickliter who shot a career-low 62 in a round at honolulu had five birdies and an easy eagle-3 on the 501-yard 15th hole where he dropped a 3-iron approach within 3 1/2 feet
a federal judge considering whether to restore sen john mccain's name to state presidential primary ballots accused new york's gop leaders of trying to guarantee texas gov george w bush an uncontested ride through the march 7 primary
isn't that the reality of what's happening here us district judge edward korman asked friday during a 3 1/2 hour conference with lawyers from the state gop and the campaigns of mccain steve forbes and alan keyes it's being done to wall off the republican primary
korman said it appeared top state republicans had designed onerous ballot access rules in an effort to save bush their chosen candidate the trouble of fending off primary challenges the judge said he was considering cutting by 80 percent the number of signatures state gop leaders can require candidates to collect
he said he would issue a decision by the end of next week
a state judge threw mccain's name off ballots in eight new york congressional districts on thursday leaving him unable to contest the march 7 primary in 14 of the state's 31 districts the possibility that republicans in more than a third of the state may be unable to vote for a candidate who some polls show leading in the crucial new hampshire primary has prompted renewed criticism of new york's notoriously tough ballot access rules
the cumulative effect of these rules makes it virtually impossible for candidates to get on the ballot without spending a huge amount of money or having the support of the state party mccain attorney burt neuborne said in brooklyn federal court it seriously burdens voters of the state of new york if they cannot express their support for sen john mccain
state party leaders say the requirements are a legitimate way of determining whether candidates have statewide support and that mccain's campaign should have done a better job of signature-gathering
the mccain campaign was not a reasonably diligent campaign and that's the standard said lawrence mandelker a lawyer for the state party
the forbes campaign joined mccain's lawsuit and asked korman to place the millionaire publisher's name back on the ballot in three long island congressional districts where his petitions were declared invalid forbes has so far spent more than $650000 trying to get on the ballot
mccain stumping in new hampshire said he welcomed forbes' involvement in the case i am glad he's joined us mccain said it shows that other people are deprived ballot access too
lawyers for keyes asked the judge to eliminate the requirement that signatures be collected district by district and instead allow candidates to appear on the ballot if they gather 5000 names statewide
keyes and gary bauer decided not to contest the new york primary because of the complicated requirements but keyes' lawyers asked that both candidates be allowed to try again under a lower standard
the federal judge appeared to be considering a reduction in the number of signatures republican candidates must collect in each congressional district
candidates are now required to get signatures of 5 percent of each district's registered republicans plus 5000 more signatures statewide korman discussed with lawyers the possibility of reducing the district requirement to 1 percent
forbes sued successfully in federal court in 1996 to appear on the ballot when state party leaders lined up behind eventual nominee bob dole korman ruled then that the party must reduce its per-district signature requirement from 5 percent to 5 percent party leaders and the state legislature decided last year to use the judge's requirement this time around
but korman on friday criticized the gop for imposing other burdensome rules and said because so many signatures are challenged the 5 percent is not a true 5 percent
he questioned the requirement that volunteers only be allowed to gather signatures in their own districts the imposition of a 37-day limit on petition drives and the fact that the drives fall during the busy holiday season
why are there 37 days only the judge asked why is it the hardest 37 days why are there restrictions on who can circulate petitions there ought to be some answers
meanwhile forbes plans to challenge bush's petitions in six districts where campaign workers claim to have uncovered fraud including lists of signatures apparently written in the same handwriting
jeffrey buley general counsel to the state republican committee said that although there might be isolated incidents of fraud he was confident all of bush's petitions were valid
while baseball wondered whether juan gonzalez would get a record-setting deal some older players found new teams friday and four in arbitration settled on new contracts
talk of a possible $140 million eight-year contract between detroit and its new outfielder buzzed through team offices but there was no indication a deal was done or even close
however the sides said they are talking
we have had ongoing negotiations for some time tigers general manager randy smith said the talks have been very private and anything i say would probably be detrimental
if gonzalez does get a $140 million eight-year deal the average salary of $175 million would break the current mark of $15 million set on dec 12 1998 when kevin brown and the los angeles dodgers agreed to a $105 million seven-year contract
shortstop derek jeter and the new york yankees have been talking about a $1185 million seven-year contract which would average $16928571
meanwhile some veterans out on the market agreed to minor league contracts bobby bonilla with atlanta danny tartabull with san diego and mark wohlers with cincinnati
bonilla cut loose by the new york mets earlier this month would get a $200000 one-year contract if he makes the roster of the braves who are looking for insurance in case andres galarraga isn't ready to come back
bonilla and the mets agreed to defer his $59 million salary for 12-36 years at an 8 percent annual interest rate paying him a total of $29831205 from 2011 to 2035
if the braves sign him to a major league contract that would reduce the total by about 339 percent or $1011278
also friday pitcher pat rapp agreed to a $750000 one-year contract with the baltimore orioles
settling their arbitration cases were arizona left-hander brian anderson $11 million for three years atlanta outfielder andruw jones $37 million for one year yankees reliever ramiro mendoza $14 million for one year and boston right-hander john wasdin $16 million for two years
jones in arbitration for the first time got a more than 10-fold increase from his $330000 salary last season
forty players remain in arbitration with the first case scheduled to be heard tuesday at tampa fla

glen rice added 19 points for los angeles and ron harper had 10 assists
o'neal also blocked four shots and had eight rebounds and got a rare restful game playing just 33 minutes he went 13-of-18 from the floor
the bucks' most lopsided loss prior to the game was an 106-84 defeat at indiana
the lakers had lost four of their last six including a defeat at indiana that stopped their 16-game winning streak los angeles' 34-9 record is still the best in the nba
the lakers had gotten little time off so far this month playing 20 games in 12 days before getting a three-day break heading in against the bucks and they looked rested especially o'neal
coming into the game against the bucks the lakers had lost 95-91 to portland in los angeles and 105-101 at utah in double overtime
their victory was their ninth straight over milwaukee
trailing 48-47 five minutes into the second quarter the lakers outscored milwaukee 20-8 including a 16-5 stretch to lead 67-55 at halftime o'neal had 16 points in the quarter
he missed just two of his 13 field goal attempts in the first half and also had five rebounds and blocked three shots
animal rights activists say there are better ways city officials can control nuisance pigeons rather than having them shot at by animal control sharpshooters
six animal control workers carry 22-caliber rifles when they are called to handle residents' complaints about unwanted wildlife
they are a bunch of inhumane cowboys enjoying target practice on taxpayer dollars said stephanie boyles wildlife biologist for people for the ethical treatment of animals residents who like pigeons or those who just don't want bullets flying down their street shouldn't be paying for this
peta suggests making pigeon roosting site less hospitable by tying up wind chimes playing a radio putting up effigies of predator birds or flying a balloon with big eyes drawn on it
people feed the birds or leave their trash out attracting them ms boyles said and then the birds are shot at paying for our irresponsibility
mayor's spokesman peter cutler said peta's suggestions will be considered he said the city is concerned about shooting in residential areas - which would be illegal in most municipalities if done by private citizens
we're concerned for the health and safety of all residents so we need to watch out for disease but on the same token we don't want anybody harmed while these guys are out there cutler said
he said the rifles are used only in the most extreme circumstances
frank poincelot the city's head pest-control and wildlife officer told the buffalo news that pest-control officers sometimes go through 50 or 60 rounds of ammunition in one day
shooters often are called to clear away birds perched on roof peaks of single- and two-family houses
officials insist the shooters don't miss although a 22-caliber bullet can travel a mile or more and potentially through a bird animal control officials say people aren't in danger
buffalo officials said other communities have killed nuisance birds by shooting them salem ore stopped shooting pigeons in 1998 after animal activists protested
the mayor of neighboring folsom was among eight people arrested in a police sweep targeting drugs and prostitution
police said mayor everett reginald drew known as reggie drew offered an undercover female officer cash and cocaine for sex
drew leaving jail friday morning waved his arms when asked about the charges
until we're through the judicial process i can't comment he said
thursday's police sweep was the second made under a new city law that allows authorities to impound cars used in prostitution and drug crimes police chief arturo venegas said
drew 57 was booked on five felony and misdemeanor prostitution and drug counts and released on $5000 bond the sacramento county district attorney will decide whether to file formal charges
capt ted mandalla said drew approached the undercover officer who was standing on a sacramento street and offered cash and a small quantity of rock cocaine for the sex act they agreed upon
they went to a nearby motel the police were using for the sweep and arrested drew there police said
results of chemical tests taken to determine if drew was under the influence of drugs are not yet back mandalla said
folsom a city of 48000 in eastern sacramento county is known mainly for its giant state prison complex drew also is a manager with the state prison industry authority
julia rubin senior national photo editor for the associated press has been named entertainment editor for the news service

president clinton's whirlwind visit here today raises to a new high the american profile at an annual gathering of economic and political leaders at a time when the forum is wresting with tensions between haves and have-nots in the global economy
clinton's acceptance of the invitation of the world economic forum was a coup for the foundation that runs the meeting and the swiss professor klaus schwab who started the annual meetings 30 years ago as an informal gathering of economic elites
it is the first time an american president has joined the gathering top administration officials and leading members of congress and state governments have routinely attended the forums but the clinton entourage makes this the biggest us delegation yet a forum spokeswoman said
one organizer quipped there will be more members of the us cabinet here than there usually are in washington dc they include secretary of state madeleine albright commerce secretary william daley treasury secretary lawrence h summers and energy secretary bill richardson as well as other top clinton administration officials
clinton was preceded to davos by his wife hillary rodham clinton in 1998 when she appealed for more attention to the needs of women and children last year vice president al gore used the forum to propose broad and deep cuts in barriers to farm trade
undaunted by threats of anti-free trade demonstrations clinton was expected to return in his speech today to the same theme he addressed in seattle last month the need to include worker rights and environmental safeguards in global trade talks
his audience in the alpine resort - nearly 2000 leaders of world corporations governments and academia - has already been urged by other top speakers - including british prime minister tony blair - to take steps in world trade that will allay the anxieties of people fearing a loss of jobs or income because of shifting investments
groups that oppose the closed meetings of the six-day forum and the megacorporations represented in davos plan to defy a swiss ban on demonstrations today they say the elite meeting has undue influence on the lives of people around the world
security in the narrow valley town has been tightened further with checks being made on people traveling into the resort by road or train the swiss army has been dispatched for the first time to act as reinforcements to police brought in from across switzerland
the session of the world trade organization in seattle late last year saw large demonstrations by opponents and some protests turned into violent clashes with police
clinton's views on trade coincide with those of many peaceful anti-wto protesters in seattle
the ideas clash however with those of many developing countries that regard the attempt to impose labor standards in trade agreements as being unfair interference in their affairs by rich nations and a new trade round will fail to go forward until it receives support from across the 135-member wto
albright's arrival friday started shifting the attention of the gathering to the search for solutions to regional tensions
she met separately with the foreign ministers of greece and turkey friday encouraging the cautious steps the two nato allies are taking to overcome decades of mistrust
officials said clinton and albright would be meeting with other leaders representing peoples involved in regional tensions or conflicts including the presidents of armenia and azerbaijan
albright also is to join clinton in a session with palestinian leader yasser arafat but israeli prime minister ehud barak on friday canceled his visit to the forum which ruled out a possible three-way meeting on middle east peace
not everyone in davos was thrilled by clinton's appearance at the forum bruno gerber the 13000-population town's tourism director said we are not ready and not big enough and not organized enough in such a small resort to have such an army of people just trying to secure one man
i'm quite glad that he's not going to stay here for a couple of days gerber told the associated press that would not be good for the resort
bond has been set at $1 million for a teen-ager who allegedly dumped her newborn baby into the garbage just seven hours after giving birth

state's attorney douglas gansler had requested that montague be held without bond but said he was satisfied with the $1 million figure

a woman who prosecutors said made her daughter so sick that the girl had her gall bladder appendix and part of her intestines removed has been sentenced to five years in prison

prosecutors said bush 42 had munchausen syndrome by proxy a psychological disorder in which a parent causes illnesses in the child to get attention
i never harmed my daughter - physically emotionally psychologically or medically bush told the judge i love jennifer with all my heart and all my soul
by 1996 when the state started its investigation jennifer had been hospitalized 200 times and had undergone about 40 operations doctors treated her for seizures infections and symptoms such as diarrhea and vomiting
prosecutors said bush gave her daughter excessive dosages of seizure medication tampered with her feeding machine and fabricated symptoms on her medical charts
a former state senator and son of a civil rights leader has been sentenced to four years in prison for billing $5700 in phony expenses to the state and asking a witness to help him cover it up
ralph david abernathy iii the son and namesake of one of the rev martin luther king jr's top lieutenants was indicted in 1998 on 35 counts accusing him of stealing more than $13000
after one trial ended with a hung jury he was convicted last month of 18 counts for taking $5700 committing forgery violating his oath of office and offering a witness $2700
abernathy 40 claimed the bogus expenses between 1994 and 1997 and said much of the money went to pay aides for legislative services he was convicted of forging the aides names on letters claiming they had received the money
abernathy also received six years of probation despite pleas for leniency from his mother and the rev hosea williams a civil rights leader and close friend of abernathy's late father
my son is not a criminal he is not a crook he has made some mistakes as all of us in this room have juanita abernathy said of her son
abernathy served three terms in the state senate but was barred from seeking re-election in 1998 because his $400 qualifying check bounced
the senate reprimanded abernathy in 1998 after he was caught with a small amount of marijuana in his underwear at the atlanta airport after a flight from jamaica

two border patrol agents stand on the banks of one of the most polluted rivers in north america and shout at six illegal immigrants in their underwear who have floated into the united states clutching an inner tube
get out of the river it's very dangerous george wetjen calls out in spanish to the men just 10 feet away
but the immigrants ignore the agents they float past and vanish into the night holding the inner tube with one hand and gripping black plastic bags containing their dry clothes with the other
the immigrants have beaten the border patrol that's because agents draw the line at getting in the new river - an oily foul-smelling stew of raw sewage industrial waste agricultural runoff and trash that flows from the border city of mexicali mexico into the california desert
desperate to reach the united states and blocked by tighter security elsewhere along the southwestern border illegal immigrants use the river as a nearly guaranteed path into the region east of san diego one of the nation's busiest corridors for illegal immigration
some immigrants may not know the new river is badly polluted others don't care
the river is posted with signs warning of drowning rattlesnakes and the treacherous terrain but not pollution still a glance and a sniff are all it takes to know stiff clumps of foam glide along on the surface plastic jugs empty cans and blocks of wood bob in the water and line the banks the stench of sewage is overpowering
what's not seen are the carcinogens bacteria and viruses
anyone who swims in the river risks exposure to such things as salmonella typhoid e coli bacteria and parasites said yvonne smith public health director for imperial county
it's like having a rattlesnake in your backyard she said you have no idea when it's going to hit and make someone sick
sometimes agents find dark-colored vomit from immigrants who swallowed river water and got sick after reaching the river banks
but if immigrants are falling ill from the water they aren't reporting it said vivian perez administrator of an imperial valley clinic for migrant workers
they make jokes about it perez said they say go in the new river and you come out glowing'
earlier this month border patrol agent matt daly fell in while chasing a group of immigrants he immediately went back to the station for a shower then to a hospital for a hepatitis a vaccine and a polio booster shot
i got some in my mouth it was a bad experience he said
at least 11 immigrants floated through the gap in the 12-foot steel border fence on jan 23 wetjen said 75 made it the night before and 25 earlier that week january is a busy time because many mexicans went home for the holidays and are returning to jobs in the united states
jose luis angel who monitors the river for the state water resources control board has photographed immigrants camouflaging themselves with the foam piling it on their heads as they float downstream border agents have seen parents use the foam to hide their babies and older children
the immigrants' goal is to float across the border less than a mile to calexico where they slip into neighborhoods until someone picks them up
about 20 minutes after the men passed wetjen on the inner tube he spotted them walking down a calexico street in dry clothes he stopped his chevy tahoe but they scattered when he got out wetjen caught one
the one caught francisco campos said he is from the state of jalisco on mexico's pacific coast he had been headed for the san fernando valley in los angeles to work campos wearing a flannel work shirt boots and a denver broncos baseball cap said he had never heard of the new river until he arrived in mexicali three days earlier
i didn't know it was dangerous he said they said there's no current but the current is really strong and it's cold
campos was taken back to the station for fingerprinting and was promptly returned to mexico with a warning that he shower and change his clothes to avoid getting sick
the environmental protection agency lists the river as one of the most polluted in north america it contains 15 million gallons of untreated or partially treated sewage from the overwhelmed sewer system in mexicali a city of more than 600000
eugenia mcnaughton who monitors the river for the epa said mexico and the united states are working to reduce the pollution spending $50 million to expand mexicali's sewer capacity

the maximum security prison de la sante - meaning health - is a scourge on the heart of paris according to veronique vasseur who has run the penitentiary's medical department since 1992
her book chief doctor at la sante prison published this month in france reveals a hidden world of horrors just feet from a sidewalk lined with chestnut trees in southern paris
in a universe where victims and violence steal headlines vasseur's graphic account of cockroaches and rats rapes and self-mutilations shocked authorities and - within a week after excerpts were published in the daily le monde - drew promises of major reforms in french prisons
of the nation's 187 prisons 109 are more than 80 years old justice minister elisabeth guigou said last week she conceded that la sante - built in 1867 - is a dilapidated establishment which does not meet the norms that our nation has a right to expect
last year 124 prisoners committed suicide in french jails - one of the highest rates in europe according to the international prison observatory three inmates took their lives at la sante where 1202 people are currently jailed
last weekend guigou announced the closure of three prisons she described as shameful ruins and plans to build seven new ones the nation's five largest facilities including la sante will be renovated she said
vasseur's book an account of her work - often on the job alone in the middle of the night - breached the wall of silence surrounding the prison system
la sante is not just any institution
indeed other prisons may be worse than la sante but for many french the 19th century prison where terrorists spies politicians and poets were jailed epitomizes the very idea of incarceration
it's a place peopled with phantoms vasseur wrote recalling that writers paul verlaine and guillaume apollinaire spent time there as did painter le douanier rousseau
today the man known as carlos the jackal once considered the world's most wanted terrorist is serving a life sentence there
vasseur who still works at la sante described the institution as a wasteland with not a trace of grass not a plant not a flower not a single tree on the 10-acre sprawl
and she painted a picture of a vermin-infested cells where orange peels are used to hide the stench of toilets skin diseases are the norm sex though forbidden is common among prisoners and staff and the weak are victimized by rackets and rapes
some prisoners turn to self-mutilation the prison doctor said
it's incredible what they can swallow razor blades keys coins nail clippers knives forks spoons nuts bolts nails spectacles she wrote
state prosecutor jean-pierre dintilhac denounced the excessive and voluntarily provocative account by vasseur and a prison employees' union demanded she apologize for implicating prison guards in beatings and sexual acts
however la sante's director alain jego recently opened the prison doors for a rare visit by several journalists whose grim description of overcrowding and moldy showers reinforced vasseur's account
more than two dozen public figures who have been imprisoned including a former president of the oil giant elf-aquitaine loik le floch-prigent published a petition denouncing prison conditions
the petition addressed to the justice minister notes a system by which rich prisoners are allowed to use their money to buy a television set a private refrigerator and decent food while poor prisoners go without
prison is a world of humiliations scandalous inequalities where the law of the strongest and the privileges of money reign the petition says prison is a school for crime
the petition says that about half of france's prisoners - 40 percent at la sante - are awaiting trial and therefore presumed innocent
i have tears in my eyes vasseur wrote she had just learned that prisoners are sent to la sante in tiny cubicles in the back of trucks like cattle
cuban president fidel castro says elian gonzalez' mother was practically kidnapped by her boyfriend and intimidated into leaving for the united states countering claims that she was on a flight to freedom with her 6-year-old son
many who want elian to remain in the united states say his mother elisabeth brotons was trying to bring him to freedom in a voyage across the straits of florida that ended with shipwreck she and 10 others drowned and elian was left floating alone in an inner-tube
but castro speaking to a conference of economists friday denounced that idea he blamed the tragedy on brotons' boyfriend lazaro rafael munero who apparently organized the ill-fated journey in late november which he also died
the mother was practically kidnapped along with the boy to make the trip castro said the mother was taken in conditions of intimidation
castro called munero a ruffian on whom cuban police had amassed 100 pages of reports
according to sources quoted by the miami herald munero - who reportedly drove a taxi in the cuban city of cardenas - had fled to florida in june 1998 and returned to cuba later that year only to be jailed for several months
castro called brotons an excellent girl who had suffered seven miscarriages before delivering elian
one who is born among eight pregnancies how desired that child must be castro said brotons had separated from elian's father several years ago though both continued to see the child regularly
earlier friday tens of thousands of children took part in a government-organized rally in havana calling for the return of cuba's boy hero the rally friday also celebrated the birth of independence hero jose marti and called both martyrs
castro said cuba could carry on such protests - which have continued daily for two months - for 10 years
elian's grandmothers meanwhile were considering returning home to cuba after a week in the united states trying to win the boy's return said the rev joan brown campbell of the national council of churches the new york-based group has facilitated their travel and supports the boy's repatriation
the boy's great-uncle and other relatives in miami are fighting to keep him in the united states
the immigration and naturalization service has ruled elian should return to his father in cuba but its order has not been carried out because the federal government agreed to hold off until the miami relatives could challenge it in court
at a hearing friday in miami us district judge william hoeveler moved up to feb 22 from march 6 the date when he would hear arguments on whether the relatives' lawsuit should be dismissed
while a move in congress to grant the child us citizenship seemed to be faltering the nun who hosted a meeting between the boy and his grandmothers urged us attorney general janet reno on friday to let the boy stay in the united states
sister jeanne o'laughlin told reno in a meeting friday that she has come to believe separating elian from his florida relatives would be another traumatic loss for him after the death of his mother
reno a longtime friend of o'laughlin said she continues to support the ins's ruling for the boy's return
o'laughlin conceded to reporters i am no longer neutral in the elian question reno had chosen the nun as a disinterested party to host the grandmothers' visit with elian
in havana on friday tens of thousands of children flooded the plaza of the revolution to deliver a dual homage to marti and elian wearing red communist pioneer neckerchiefs children recited poems they wrote for elian
the communist party daily granma called elian a symbol of the crimes and injustices imperialism is capable of committing against an innocent
it compared the boy's image emblazoned on hundreds of thousands of t-shirts here with that of revolutionary icon ernesto che guevara one that will spread across the world and remain forever in our mind and in our hearts
in old havana hundreds of children marched around the parque central chanting we will save elian some girls wore construction-paper handcuffs - an apparent reference to the government's claim elian has been kidnapped
since his release from prison a month ago fumihiro joyu has presented a very different image from that of the strident spokesman he once was for the doomsday cult accused in the 1995 nerve gas attack on tokyo's subways
trading his religious garb for a suit and tie joyu and other cult members have embarked on a campaign of apologies vows of reform and statements distancing themselves from the guru they once worshipped as a living god
so far they are generating more fear than sympathy
authorities see the cult's claims of contrition as an attempt to get around laws passed last month that strengthen the government's hand in seizing cult assets and monitoring its activities
and as further evidence all is not well police are still trying to unravel the bizarre kidnapping earlier this month of asahara's eldest son - possibly indicating a power struggle within the cult
the public reaction to the cult has been utter rejection said makoto hogetsu a crime expert and professor of sociology at kyoto university people see their overtures as camouflage
though the cult has never stopped functioning joyu's return has greatly increased worries that it may enjoy a resurgence
eloquent and charismatic joyu 37 was one of the cult's most high-profile members at the time of the march 1995 subway attack he was never charged in the gassing but served a three-year prison sentence for a cult-related forgery
with the cult's other leaders still in prison or on trial joyu appears to be filling the leadership vacuum he has denied taking over the helm but shortly after his release he announced a need for fundamental reform
that included removing asahara as guru while insisting that asahara was spiritually a genius joyu acknowledged the old leadership including asahara was responsible for the gassing
prosecutors say asahara ordered cult followers to poke holes in plastic bags filled with lethal sarin gas spreading the poison and sending commuters into convulsions a dozen people died and thousands were sickened
the attack was intended to set off a chain of events leading to armageddon and followers justified their actions by asserting that the cult had the right to kill those it deemed unenlightened
though a shadow of its former self - the cult now has about 2000 members in japan down from the 10000 it claimed before the attack - it has been regaining strength
police say it also has a solid financial base earning about $66 million a year from a chain of discount computer shops
that prompted parliament to pass legislation requiring the cult to report its activities every three months and allowing police to inspect the group's facilities without warrants
a government panel is expected to decide in the next few weeks whether the cult continues to pose enough of a danger to be subjected to such laws
to prove it isn't a threat the cult has promised to compensate victims of the subway gas attack - something it had long refused to do
and to further bolster the argument it is now a different group than it was five years ago it has even changed its name - from aum shinri kyo to aleph the first letter in the hebrew alphabet
but the cult's position has been seriously undermined by police reports that some of its members are suspected in the jan 21 kidnapping of asahara's 7-year-old son the boy has since been found and is in government custody his mother has been convicted of murdering a cult member and is in prison
the cult has officially replaced asahara with tatsuko muraoka but she is largely seen as a figurehead
instead the cult's leadership is believed to center around joyu asahara's children and those senior officials closely linked with them asahara's 16-year-old daughter who is revered as possessing spiritual powers is being sought as a suspect in the kidnapping
all of this has raised concern among people living near cult members
we're fed up says kazuo takahashi 65 who runs a shoe repair shop near the riot-police guarded apartment building where joyu now lives i want him out but i hate to say it because he's just going to mean big trouble to others somewhere else

the old master painting had a turbulent past it had been purchased with the federally insured deposits of the mismanaged miami savings-and-loan for its high-living chairman who is now behind bars
another page was added to its history friday when peter paul rubens' portrait of a man as mars sold for $82 million at a sotheby's auction
a buyer whose name was not released by sotheby's bought the rubens and set a new record at auction for the artist said sotheby's spokesman matthew weigman it is the most important rubens to come on the auction market in the last generation weigman said
it topped the $6 million paid for the artist's samson and delilah painting which was sold at a 1980 auction in london
in 1989 florida banking officials discovered that the 17th century painting portrait of a man as mars and two dozen other artworks worth a total of $29 million were purchased with funds from the strapped centrust savings and loan the buyer was david l paul the s&ampl's art-collecting chairman and chief executive
he had paid $132 million for the rubens with sotheby's acting as agent for rush kress widow of samuel kress founder of the five-and-dime store according to the wall street journal sotheby's would not confirm the figure saying it was a private sale
but it also was a high-profile sale and it helped bring down the thrift ceo
paul was in the spotlight he had bought art for the s&ampl without first seeking special permission and the collection was the lesser expense paul had charged up about $45 million in personal expenses with centrust money
in 1990 after centrust stopped paying dividends it was taken over by the federal government in one of the biggest american savings and loan failures the thrift was liquidated and sold to great western bank in beverly hills calif
paul was convicted of fraud conspiracy and racketeering at a 1994 trial in miami and is currently serving an 11-year sentence in a federal prison in south carolina
the florida department of banking and finance ordered the paintings sold in 1989 portrait of a man as mars the image of a man dressed as the god mars was bought by a european art dealer along with six less expensive paintings in a private sale again brokered by sotheby's
the painting has spent the last decade shuttling from international art fairs to museums in four different nations it was displayed last year at manhattan's metropolitan museum of art
officials at sotheby's did not expect it to reach anywhere near the $132 million paul paid for it during the late 1980's and early 1990's cycle of booming art prices but had estimated it would sell for between $6 million and $8 million
an ap news analysis by barry renfrew associated press writer
moscow ap - despite weeks of bitter fighting the russian military is bogged down in the ruins of grozny unable to capture the shattered chechen capital or defeat its outgunned rebel defenders
why has one of the world's largest armies been struggling for months to take a single city why can't a military with 17 million troops defeat a few thousand guerrillas who have no tanks planes or heavy artillery
after years of political and economic decline in russia the military is more like an armed mob than a modern army most combat units are made up of untrained teen-age conscripts who can barely use a weapon many officers are as ill-trained and demoralized as their men
trained infantry is the backbone of any army combat training in western armies lasts up to a year with even more for officers and noncommissioned officers some of the russian soldiers killed in chechnya had been in the army for six weeks
most soldiers drafted for two years' service are desperate to get out of the military life in the ranks is hard with soldiers sometimes going hungry and enduring brutal hazing by older soldiers morale the psychological force that gives soldiers the will to fight has collapsed
all these weaknesses have been exposed in the battle for grozny reluctant russian soldiers are being hurled against experienced guerrillas fighting with fanatical determination for their homes
urban warfare is among the most difficult and dangerous kind of combat the defenders of a city have thousands of places to hide and every building can be turned into a fortress attacking forces must clear a city house by house street by street the defenders can slip around the attackers striking them on the flank or from behind at any time
the untrained demoralized russian infantry is totally unprepared for this kind of war when their fumbling ground attacks meet resistance the russians call in air and artillery strikes to clear the way
but the airstrikes rarely cause casualties among the chechen fighters who know the russian tactics and pull back before the bombardment the shelling demolishes empty buildings creating new hideouts for the chechens in the rubble and new obstacles for the russian troops
at night the russians often pull back to fortified bases giving up territory they have just taken the guerrillas reoccupy the ground and the russians must seize it again losing more men day after day
despite russian claims the military's encirclement of grozny has failed to seal off the city the rebels can move in and out with supplies especially at night when the russians pull back
grozny will almost certainly fall but not because the russian military will outfight the chechens the chechens chose to fight in grozny because it gave them the best chance to inflict casualties on the russians which is their chief aim the guerrillas who are taking some losses will pull out before their own casualties reach a point that threatens their ability to keep the war going
the russian military has based its strategy on taking grozny gambling that a high-profile victory will destroy the chechens' will to fight but the rebels likely will shift the struggle into the countryside and fight on as they did after they lost grozny during the 1994-96 fighting - a war they eventually won

with its layer of snow new hampshire's landscape may resemble iowa's but republican candidates must dig a little deeper here if they want to unearth conservative support
steve forbes spent the week pointing to his second-place showing in the iowa caucus as proof that he is the conservative gop alternative to george w bush and john mccain
but the conservative base that boosted him there may melt away in new hampshire where two key factors face him and the other candidates there just aren't as many conservative voters and those who are may be hard to herd toward one candidate
donna polychronis of rochester a rare find in new hampshire calls herself very very conservative and is leaning toward gary bauer her decision is motivated by both money and morals she said she likes bauer's 16 percent flat tax plan and his unwavering stand on abortion
he stands by his views she said i think that's why i'm shying away from the other candidates they just brush on the subject but they don't like to talk about it
in iowa caucus exit polls from monday night 37 percent of republicans said they considered themselves part of the conservative christian political movement also known as the religious right compared to just 17 percent of new hampshire republicans in 1996
i think the iowa caucus voter is primarily socially conservative in new hampshire i think it's a combination of social conservatism as well as fiscally conservative said jayne marcucci executive director of the state republican party
there are voters out there that specifically vote on their pro-life stance but i don't think that would make up the majority of the conservatives she said i think that they're also concerned with their taxes and the size of government
forbes who ran mostly on a flat-tax platform in 1996 is counting this time on drawing anti-abortion voters from the most conservative candidates - bauer and alan keyes - while swiping support from anti-tax voters from mccain and bush he says he is well aware that new hampshire conservatives represent two sides of a coin but he insists he can appeal to both
his flat tax plan fits with the state's strong anti-tax live free or die history he said
they're very independent minded they don't like government telling them what to do he said friday in an interview so there is a very different definite characteristic of the state
although the state's gop-controlled house has repeatedly rejected efforts to further regulate abortion forbes thinks the strength of the state's anti-abortion movement is underestimated
people may not like to talk about it but they do have principles he said i think they like the idea that a candidate - even if they don't fully agree with a candidate - takes a stand they appreciate someone who is forthright on that and doesn't try to dance around the issue
at a campaign event friday at memorial high school in manchester a 17-year-old student asked forbes what he would do if he had to choose between imposing a flat tax and ending abortion
i want to do my tax thing i want to do a lot of things he said but then made it clear he wanted to end abortion first if you don't protect everyone everyone is vulnerable first - life
but the issue isn't as black and white as it seems for republicans such as forbes who believe there should be exceptions for abortion in cases of rape incest and when a woman's life is in danger
asked by a reporter what he would do if his daughter wanted an abortion forbes said that if she were a minor under the law she should absolutely have the baby but he added that if she were over 18 it would be her decision although he would urge her to have the baby
we are a loving family we would provide comfort at a moment of considerable worry and panic and so we'd rally around her and assure her that in bringing the baby to term the baby would be brought up in a loving caring atmosphere forbes said
in new hampshire forbes may have more luck by tapping into anti-tax sentiment
david rapp a flower shop owner from littleton says he disagrees entirely with forbes' stand on abortion but plans to vote for him anyway because he likes his 17 percent flat tax plan
a lot of people don't seem to understand that bush's tax cuts don't go far enough said rapp who describes himself as fiscally conservative and socially libertarian
david philbrick a retired minister for the pentacostal church from dover said he settled on supporting baur after hearing him speak at a christian coalition banquet
alan keyes spoke he was quite good i won't deny him that said philbrick but then gary spoke it brought tears to my eyes
bill bradley was again answering questions about his health after experiencing another episode of irregular heartbeats in recent days the fifth in a month
bradley said the episode which he said occurred last sunday or monday did not require a doctor's attention
the democratic presidential candidate sought to downplay the episode and hadn't told staff about it until friday when reporters inquired the candidate has a non-life threatening heart condition that periodically causes his heart to go out of rhythm
the latest episode lasted roughly two hours which he said is shorter than most
bradley dismissed any idea that the timing was bad just four days before the new hampshire primary a state where he needs to win or do well to stay competitive against vice president al gore
no it doesn't mean anything he told the associated press this is an issue i haven't heard one real person talk about
he said the incident didn't last long
it goes two hours and it's back in bradley said i haven't talked to one doctor yet who thinks this is an issue he added saying he didn't consult a doctor this time
bradley disclosed on dec 10 - after he had to cancel a campaign event because his heart wouldn't stop racing - that he has had atrial fibrillation since 1996 the former senator called the condition a minor irritation and said he hadn't felt the need to reveal his condition to the press and public
on friday bradley reaffirmed his policy of voluntarily disclosing episodes only if he needs medical attention
if i have to see a doctor for a medical procedure i will disclose it immediately he said
a week ago just days before monday's iowa caucuses bradley acknowledged suffering four more episodes between christmas and jan 16 after a news organization inquired
anita dunn the campaign's communications director said bradley had been taking his medication regularly to control his heart condition bradley didn't know why the incident happened although dunn insisted it wasn't stress related
democratic activists squeezed elbow to elbow were already fanning themselves in the stuffy banquet room when bill bradley grabbed the microphone and turned up the heat on vice president al gore
calling the democratic party fund-raising scandals of 1996 embarrassing and disgraceful bradley warned if we don't clean our house the republicans will clean it for us in the fall
bradley with three days left to mount a comeback in the tuesday primary here took the stage at a benefit for the new hampshire democratic party minutes after gore vacated the hall along with about 200 of his supporters so that a quarter of the seats were empty for bradley
the democratic presidential underdog did not spell out gore's role in the 1996 controversy - the fund-raiser at the buddhist temple or the solicitations over white house phones
he didn't have to said coos county democrat bill bradley no relation we know who he's talking about
al gore was part of the problem acknowledged gore supporter frank greaney of bedford this campaign is going to get tougher
reflecting on president clinton's state of the union address the previous night bradley questioned whether the good ideas of clinton and gore could be realized under their leadership i wondered will we ever be able to achieve those programs with politics as usual bradley said
in his own remarks gore sounded a different kind of warning
his voice rising gore looked up from the prepared text he had stuck to for much of his speech and argued that he is the just the fighter democrats need to beat back republicans in the general election
make no mistake about the passion that will be needed for the fight that lies ahead gore said make no underestimate of the forces of resistance that are out there hungry to take back the white house and bend the policies to the wishes of their special-interest-group friends
the rivals' different arguments struck coos county democratic chairman paul robitaille gore makes you want to go out and win bradley makes you think about why you want to go out and win robitaille said
gore made little mention in his speech of bradley except to say that he is a worthy opponent here in new hampshire
earlier friday bradley directly questioned gore's truthfulness portraying him as the kind of politician who uses words in a very tricky manner
you have to look at every word and every clause bradley said in a comment echoing accusations that critics made about clinton during the monica lewinsky investigation
as polls show gore with an apparent lead just days before tuesday's new hampshire primary bradley aides said he would continue his more aggressive tack
as voters make up their mind this weekend we want to make sure they are aware of the differences said communications adviser anita dunn
robitaille a gore supporter said he senses in his northern region of the state a reservoir of public disgust with the clinton scandals as for bradley trying to stoke that to his advantage robitaille said there is clinton fatigue but whether this is going to be enough to turn the tide against gore i'm not sure
new york city officials could sense it the bad publicity the worse jokes
and so predictably they announced friday that welfare recipients could no longer apply for jobs with the psychic network through a city program the telephone pay service offered clairvoyance at $499 a minute
though hra believes people should have the freedom to choose their own employment hra's business link has decided to not include the psychic network as one of its participating employers said a statement from hra commissioner jason a turner
the decision to pull the plug on the psychic connection came hours after the hiring policy was made public since last april network instructors had taught 15 welfare clients to read tarot cards and offer their callers a peek into the future
this leaves welfare workers applying for employment with a less interesting selection of jobs from a variety of companies rite aid madison square garden macy's
not quite the psychic gig eh
initially hra spokeswoman ruth reinecke said the jobs were odd-sounding but not strange at all
the pay is rather good and it's attractive to work out of the home for the mothers who have young children she said
the qualifications were a high school diploma and the ability to read write and speak english the pay started at $10 an hour plus bonuses the ability to see into the future was not a prerequisite
the city refused to provide any information about the psychic network citing a confidentiality agreement with companies that participate in the workfare program the plan attempts to lower the welfare rolls by finding jobs for recipients city officials say they have done that for 538000 people since 1996
the hra offices received a large number of calls about the plan after the new york times first reported it a pittsburgh radio reporter trying to track down an hra spokeswoman said the report was the subject of great mirth in the steel city
a woman in the hra offices friday was laughing when she answered another reporter's call is this about the psychics she intuitively inquired
while the 900-number services are a quirky business they are legitimate their ads must run with a required disclaimer that the calls are strictly for entertainment value
trying to track down the owner of the psychic network could require the use of tea leaves the only phone listing under the name is a florida bookstore that has no connection to the telephone business
in new york there was no listing for the psychic network attempts to reach the company telepathically were also unsuccessful
the psychic phone lines often advertised on late-night television or via informercials haven't drawn this much attention since the psychic friends network filed for chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in february 1998
the psychic friends - actually inphomation communication inc - were best-known for the 30-minute informercials hosted by singer dionne warwick
federal regulators have undone a controversial decision that had sparked a storm of protest from the nation's religious broadcasters and republican lawmakers
the federal communications commission reversed its determination that certain religious programming could not count as educational
the fcc's original action though affecting only a limited number of religious broadcasters had prompted complaints that regulators were trying to control the content of religious tv a lawmaker introduced legislation this week that would have undone the fcc's order
on friday the commissioners in a 4-1 vote undid it themselves
regrettably it has become clear that our actions have created less certainty rather than more contrary to our intent the commission said
the controversy stemmed from an fcc decision in december that offered additional guidance for noncommercial broadcasters who seek licenses for specially reserved educational tv channels to qualify for such licenses the commission said that broadcasters must devote 50 percent of their regularly scheduled air time to educational programs
the commission determined that programming primarily devoted to religious exhortation proselytizing or statements of personally held religious views and beliefs generally would not qualify as general educational programming in a footnote it said church services also normally would not qualify as general educational programming
that language drew fire from hundreds of religious broadcasters and a number of republican lawmakers
rep michael oxley r-ohio who had proposed the bill to repeal the fcc's action said he was thrilled by the reversal
religious broadcasters and their listeners were a target for an fcc that sought to limit their freedom to express religious faith oxley said
bud paxson chairman of paxson communications corp one of the nation's biggest owners of television stations commended the fcc for its turnaround as did the national religious broadcasters
fcc chairman bill kennard had tried to calm the furor by stressing that the ruling did not apply to the majority of religious broadcasters who operate on commercial channels about 373 television stations hold educational reserve licenses nationwide but about only 20 of these are religious broadcasters according to fcc estimates
even those who wanted special educational licenses would still only have to meet the requirement that 50 percent of their programming be educational kennard noted in letters to lawmakers
but the fcc acknowledged friday the difficulty of minting clear definitional parameters for educational instructional or cultural programming
commissioner michael powell who had dissented from the original decision to issue the guidance in december said it has opened a pandora's box of problems he supported the fcc's action to return the judgment back to broadcasters
but commissioner gloria tristani accused the fcc of caving in to an organized campaign of distortion and demagoguery she particularly took issue with critics who suggested that the commission had an anti-religious bias
i reject and resent this type of attack reminiscent of a witch hunt tristani wrote in her dissenting opinion
jerry starr co-chairman of the grassroots save pittsburgh public tv campaign said he was dismayed by the fcc's reversal
we're stunned by the sudden and last-minute capitulation said starr who had organized an effort among groups that included the national education association to defend the guidelines
the clinton administration is proposing new farm subsidies that would take effect when commodity prices are low
the supplemental income payments estimated to cost taxpayers $31 billion this year would vary in size according to fluctuations in crop revenue they are meant to substitute for emergency subsidies that congress has made the past two years to compensate growers for a collapse in exports and commodity prices
agriculture secretary dan glickman said the program would strengthen the farm safety net until congress rewrites existing farm policy in 2002
payments will increase when times are the toughest and will taper off when prices rebound glickman said in a conference call friday with farm broadcasters
the administration's proposal which is similar to an idea offered last year by rep charles stenholm d-texas is certain to run into opposition from many producers and lawmakers because of the limits on the payments
the payments would be pegged to the average gross income nationally over the past five years for eight major crops - corn wheat cotton rice soybeans sorghum oats and barley - and would be capped at $30000 per operation most farmers would get far less than that because their annual market-transition payments the fixed subsidies they receive under the 1996 law would count toward the $30000 limit
some 13 million farmers currently receive market transition payments and 200000 get at least $10000 a year of those 30000 receive more than $30000
the size of an operation doesn't necessarily limit the difficulty that anybody has financially said dick newpher chief lobbyist for the american farm bureau federation the nation's largest farm group we would like to help all of agriculture
but john schnittker sr a private consultant and former agriculture department economist said that capping the payments is the right thing to do both from the fiscal standpoint to avoid runaway costs and from the standpoint of getting most of the money to relatively modest-size farmers
the program would fix what the clinton administration and some producer groups see as a major flaw in the 1996 farm law which scaled back income-based farm subsidies ended controls on planting and gave farmers a series of fixed annual payments critics say the fixed payments were insufficient when commodity prices fell sharply in 1998
the new subsidy program will be included in president clinton's 2001 budget along with $13 billion in farm conservation spending that vice president al gore announced earlier this month and an additional $640 million earmarked for cutting premiums on federally subsidized crop insurance the government has offered similar insurance discounts in 1999 and again this year in order to encourage more farmers to buy the coverage to protect against weather-related losses
because commodity prices are only expected to rise slowly during the next several years support has been building in congress and among farm organizations to come up with a new way to subsidize growers when prices are low
the administration's new program was originally proposed by economists at the agriculture department and ohio state university in the early 1990s critics have said the payments could worsen the worldwide grain glut by encouraging farmers to plant crops in areas where they do not do well something the 1996 farm law was intended to discourage
newpher the farm bureau lobbyist praised the administration for proposing the program clinton had proposed improving the farm safety net in his state of the union message a year ago and again thursday night but the administration never spelled out a proposal of its own until friday
we need to get started on this discussion right away newpher said
nutrition experts who are revising the government's dietary guidelines will be allowed to issue their recommendations despite a lawsuit that contends they are biased because of ties to the meat and dairy industries
groups representing vegetarians and racial minorities say that the 11-member advisory committee working on the revision should have included at least one representative of people who use federal nutrition programs
but us district judge james robertson on friday declined their request to block the recommendations from being released he noted during a hearing that the committee's proposed revision was unlikely to include any major changes from the current version
the committee's work which must be approved by the departments of agriculture and health and human services is expected to be made public in the next few weeks the departments are expected to take public comment on the proposed revision for 60 days before deciding whether to approve it
first published in 1980 the guidelines are revised every five years to reflect the latest developments in scientific research the committee's revision will put more emphasis on eating whole grains fruits and vegetables while urging reduced consumption of sweets and saturated fat the guidelines which follow the government's food pyramid will continue to recommend meat and dairy products
federally funded nutrition programs including school lunches and meals on wheels are required to adhere to the recommendations and they are also widely used by professionals and dietitians in advising consumers
the lawsuit filed by the physicians committee for responsible medicine and other groups contends the guidelines emphasize the consumption of meat dairy and egg products and ignore the special dietary needs of minority groups including blacks who are often lactose intolerant at least six of the committee members have ties to the meat and dairy industries through grants or seats on advisory boards the lawsuit says
lawyers for the groups said they had not decided whether to appeal the judge's decision
the government is seeking to have the lawsuit dismissed
the committee members are very accomplished distinguished individuals who are at the top of their fields and include a black and hispanic said meredith manning a justice department lawyer she told the judge that the plaintiffs are essentially trying to get a major change in food policy enacted through the judicial branch when they can't get that enacted through the executive and legislative branches

french mime marcel marceau told the national press club on friday that he never speaks on stage but on the talk shows very much 
marceau 76 answered questions on subjects that ranged from education for miming to his jewish heritage and his admiration for jesus christ
he will be performing silently at ford's theater until feb 13
nicki miller publicist for the theater where abraham lincoln was shot said marceau had added to the program his one-man rendition of all the participants in a murder trial he did the number here she explained because washington is the center of our judicial system
if he had not been a mime marceau told a questioner he would have liked to be a painter a book about him published in france includes reproductions of his paintings ms miller said his host at the national press club remarked that marceau's notes for his talk were covered with little sketches
he had doubts about teaching his own art to children
children can mime angels but they don't know social what is it consciousness he said sometimes they can bring emotion in films because films are a reality and they can play this reality but the theater is full of metaphors and you have to teach children about this life it's very much to ask of a young child
he was asked about his jewish heritage
anti-semitism had affected him when he was a child he replied though it had not changed his life
but i loved jesus christ marceau went on he was the best of the jews how can you be an anti-semite when you're christian our father died he was deported yes i cried for him but 85 million people were deported and killed during the war among those kids was maybe an einstein a mozart somebody who would have found a cancer drug this is why we have a great responsibility let us love one another
the first black history month of the new millennium begins tuesday with a tribute to the originator of the idea carter g woodson half a century after his death
jacqueline goggin his biographer will tell how he worked to popularize a knowledge of the past particularly the african-american past for those who still find history too dry tap dancers brother black and 10-year-old cartier anthony williams will also appear on the program at the national museum of natural history
that's the way we always do it said jo ann webb we have a lecture and then some entertainment too
ms webb was among the officials promoting black history programs among the 16 museums and galleries of the smithsonian institution
woodson who died in 1950 founded what is now the association for the study of afro-american life and history in 1915 he first proposed negro history week held in the month that includes the birthdays of frederick douglass and abraham lincoln for whom douglass helped recruit black troops in the civil war
the national gallery of art displays the memorial sculpted by august saint-gaudens to the first black unit in the war the massachusetts 54th regiment an audio taped guide with an account of the memorial by gen colin powell accompanies it
by 1976 negro history week had evolved into black history month
the kennedy center which includes washington's opera house a concert hall large and small theaters and two stages for daily free performances works hard to bring in black audiences
on thursday and friday it will put on a program that includes world premieres of two south african works at the fountains of mpindelela is a multi-media tribute to nelson mandela ushaka is a chamber version of an oratorio by composer mzilikazi khumalo

beginning feb 10 the kennedy center will put on an exhibit called abomey history told on walls it will show some of the earliest examples of low-relief carving from the palaces of the kings of dahomey in their west african capital
in a society with no written language the kennedy center said in announcing the show these visual stories have perpetuated the history and myths of the fon people
between feb 14 and feb 18 cyprien tokoudagba an artist from benin will demonstrate how the carvings were produced
the philips collection which claims to be the first american museum of modern art will devote thursday evening to a program on migrations by jacob lawrence it's a series of paintings that describe the movement of african americans from the southern states to the north
to bring history up to date the national building museum will run a tour on feb 19 of buildings and institutions in washington built by and for african americans
but the smithsonian has the most extensive program - a series of exhibits films and live performances it ends feb 29 with a lecture at the most-visited of all us galleries - the air and space museum - on the role of african americans in flight
three times mr liu has had himself smuggled out of china to find work - to taiwan japan and then hawaii
each time he was caught and sent home
jobless and broke the 26-year-old high school dropout wants to try again following a trail blazed by generations of men from china's poor southeastern coast
a lot of my friends have gone my family thinks i should go said liu who asked not to be identified further
as they try to stop an influx of smuggled workers the united states and other nations are facing growing numbers of determined and resourceful chinese job-hunters driven by the same desperate ambition
migrants pay up to $60000 to endure weeks at sea in primitive conditions risking jail in china if caught
if they succeed the prize is grueling work in sweatshops or restaurants some are held for ransom or forced into prostitution to pay off smugglers known menacingly as snake heads
this commerce in humans - risky violent and profitable - amounts to a modern slave trade according to a hong kong professor who has researched migrant smuggling for a decade
for families this still has appeal as an investment you pull your money together and send your son or best candidate abroad said ying chan of hong kong university
estimates of how many leave china every year run into the tens of thousands the united states sent home more than 1000 last year more are caught in australia japan and europe
many start out in fuzhou and other coastal towns in fujian province where people have for centuries sought their fortunes abroad descendants of earlier migrants are the elite of modern singapore and the philippines
the effect on towns around fuzhou is clearly visible
in lianjiang 30 miles to the north there are no groups of men idling on street corners because of rising unemployment a common sight in other chinese cities
china has for centuries tried to control emigration the last imperial dynasty prohibited it fearing that once abroad chinese would plot to overthrow the regime over the past 20 years as china has opened its borders for trade chinese have followed the outflow of goods
under foreign pressure the communist government is cracking down last year it raised the penalty for intercepted migrants from 15 days in jail to as much as one year smugglers can get life
a total of 9129 migrants were intercepted leaving china last year and 925 smugglers arrested according to the communist party newspaper people's daily
migrants are sent by freighter by air with false visas or hidden in cargo containers tactics change as authorities catch on said a us immigration official in the region
cargo boxes are becoming less popular since the recent seizure of 118 migrants at us and canadian ports said the official who spoke on condition of anonymity
smugglers reportedly have told migrants - falsely said the us official - that the united states will grant amnesty after its november presidential election they have also enticed migrants to australia with tales of work preparing for the olympics and an amnesty after the september games
frustrated at the growing migrant flow foreign officials are going straight chinese towns to discourage them
australia's immigration minister paul ruddock visited fujian last year and distributed 5000 posters warning against dealing with smugglers
us officials plan to visit in february with videotapes showing migrant arrests and conditions in cargo containers and aboard ships
we want to make people understand that this is dangerous and if they do it they are risking exploitation and a lifetime of indentured servitude said mark canning a spokesman for the us consulate in the southern city of guangzhou
despite the danger migrants seem to regard even low-paid jobs abroad as better than they can get at home
in fuzhou i can make 300 yuan $36 a month in the united states i can make $1000 to $2000 said liu
liu first went abroad seven years ago paying $2300 to get to taiwan where he worked in a factory he was deported after eight months but came home with $850
a trip to japan two years later ended when he was intercepted and sent home liu was lucky his deal with the smugglers said he didn't have to pay because they failed to get him into the country
the same condition applied in 1995 when liu spent six weeks on a freighter to hawaii with 136 migrants he had promised to pay $36000 but the ship was stopped at sea and after six months in detention he was back in china
liu said he had been promised a us factory job at $1800 a month and figured he could pay off the smugglers within three years
since then liu has lived with his parents
i still have no work i want to try again to go to the united states he said
liu shrugged off questions about hardships abroad and the dangers of dealing with smugglers
i'm not afraid they are giving us opportunity he said
school may be just a cold tent but 13-year-old hacer oncer is happy to be in class for the first time since a massive earthquake destroyed her city late last year
we like being back she said warming her hands before the single gas heater during recess
only three of the 87 schools in duzce survived the quakes that devastated northwestern turkey in august and november and most classes are now in tents most without electricity and some with no access to water
but returning to school has brought back something of normal life and given the children - and their parents - a routine after months of idleness psychologists say that can help the children recover from the traumatic experience
they are better since they went back to school said arife atasoy looking over at her three children they need it children can't waste a year like this
many children were happy to be reunited with their teachers
a little one was so happy to see me said gonca ozel a primary school teacher they had told her that i had died in the quake so she didn't want to come but when she saw i was alive she stayed
more than 18000 people died in two temblors on aug 17 and nov 12 the second earthquake was centered in duzce 120 miles west of istanbul and destroyed or seriously damaged most buildings of the city of 80000 people tens of thousands of people still live in temporary housing - prefabricated homes tents or makeshift huts
in war zones or in situations of natural disasters when things are very disrupted the best thing we can do is to make sure that life is normalized said rune sturland a psychologist with the un children's fund
unicef's $14 million plan for turkey's quake recovery includes psychological help for school children
when routines are re-established it gives children a sense of safety it is also very positive for the parents that their children have meaningful activities leaving the parents to deal with their own issues said sturland
tent schools are far from ideal and many parents worry about their children's health in the poorly heated tents and transportation is a problem since prefabricated homes and tent cities are far from the city center
life in the temporary shelters is difficult in some areas hundreds of people share one shower ozel the primary teacher said some children didn't want to come to school because they can't wash
like showers teachers are in short supply about 30 percent have left duzce since the quake with grades now grouped together parents are worrying about the quality of their children's education
students at one high school class in duzce said they come in the morning sit around the heater and wait for a teacher
we've lost a year said 17-year-old tugba kilicaslan who fears she has little chance of getting into university next year
despite the problems students and teachers alike say it is time to move forward teacher serap calik said his students have talked about the quake so much they're sick of it
so are we calik said it's time to start time to start classes
north korea says it happened upon more than 400 remains of people likely to be american servicemen killed in the korean war - 10 times the number that us officials have recovered during painstaking excavations in the north korean countryside over the past three years
li gun a deputy north korean representative at his country's united nations mission in new york said friday his government has offered to return the remains without conditions he said the us government must act quickly because the area where the remains were found is being converted to cropland
at the pentagon office in charge of pow-mia affairs spokesman larry greer said north korea notified the pentagon of the discovery this week
we've asked for more details greer said he said his office is leery of unilateral returns of war remains because in the past they have lacked the anthropological detail needed for individual identifications
in a telephone interview li said approximately 415 sets of human remains were uncovered in december and january in an area of north pyongan province where large areas of land are being cleared to create farmland he said it is likely that many more remains will be found before the land reclamation project is completed
about 8200 us servicemen are listed as missing from the 1950-53 korean war and the pentagon has said it believes a few thousand are potentially recoverable from north korea in us recovery operations over the past few years 42 sets of remains have been recovered negotiations on arranging joint recovery operations for this year broke down in december after the north koreans demanded that the united states donate materials and equipment for children's clothing factories
on tuesday li's office sent letters to several us veterans organizations that said some remains of the us troops killed in the korean war are being recovered by bulldozers the letter did not mention the 415 figure it said that once the land-moving operation is finished it will be difficult for us to confirm the remains sites and unable to find the remains forever
frank metersky of the chosin few group of korean war veterans said friday he doubts the north koreans' sincerity
we all agree this is a political ploy to get the pentagon involved in humanitarian assistance as a condition for the return of remains he said we do not want our government to pay ransom
metersky said li had not mentioned the 415 figure to him in conversations earlier this week metersky said he was astounded to hear that such a large number of war remains could have been found
li said his government had suggested but not demanded that the united states donate children's clothing factories as a means of compensating north korea for its cooperation in remains-recovery operations he said the intent was to show average north korean citizens whose help he said is vital to recovering remains that the united states is well intentioned and is no longer the enemy
a us-based chinese researcher was freed after being detained nearly six months in china on charges of smuggling state secrets and left today on a flight home to the united states
song yongyi a librarian at dickinson college in carlisle pennsylvania and an authority on china's cultural revolution was detained on aug 7 and charged on dec 24 under china's vague secrets law
song left china on a northwest airlines flight to detroit this morning a us official said
song's release came unexpectedly and removed an irritant from us-chinese relations as they slowly recover from nato's bombing of china's embassy in belgrade in may this past week the us and chinese militaries resumed a formal dialogue that beijing called off in anger over the bombing
sen arlen specter a republican from pennsylvania said he believed china was releasing song to curry favor with the us congress china would like congress to stop reviewing its low-tariff trading privileges annually and grant the rights permanently as part of a deal to join the world trade organization
chinese security officials on friday took song from the detention center where he had been held and sent him to a government office his wife helen yao said in a telephone interview from their us home
he called me and said he was free said yao who was arrested with song in august but released in november today is a very exciting day
song had planned to become a us citizen in september after returning from his research trip to china
us ambassador to china james prueher said he hoped song's release would be a harbinger of continued open academic research in china and of broader discussions with the chinese government on related issues prueher said in a statement he was delighted for song yongyi and his family
song 50 has written articles and a book in chinese about the 1966-76 cultural revolution when mao tse-tung unleashed a wave of radical violence to oust opponents in the communist party and ignite revolutionary zeal a million people died and millions more were persecuted song spent five years in prison accused of being a counter-revolutionary
song's specialty has been collecting documents from the cultural revolution period and making them accessible to other scholars
song was collecting old newspapers and other public documents from the period as he had done on past trips to china when he and his wife were detained on aug 7 on dec 24 he was charged with purchasing or illegally supplying intelligence for people outside the territory of china
as recently as tuesday the chinese foreign ministry accused song of harming china's national security by trying to smuggle 700 pounds of secret documents out of the country foreign ministry spokesman zhu bangzao said song had confessed zhu said song had been purchasing such materials since 1996 using funds from overseas institutions
song's detention shocked the american academic community the us government and members of congress lobbied china for his freedom more than 100 china scholars in the united states petitioned chinese president jiang zemin for his release saying song was engaged in normal academic work not espionage
song who is from shanghai attended college in china when schools reopened across the country after the cultural revolution ended he went to the united states in 1989 and earned master's degrees in chinese literature and library science and has worked at dickinson college since 1997
in the final hours of international talks friday on trade in genetically modified food and other products negotiators found themselves grappling over the same issues that doomed a similar agreement nearly a year ago
delegates scurried from room to room of the montreal hotel where the meeting was being held bearing proposals and counterproposals the shuttling delayed the start of a final plenary session for seven hours when it finally began just before midnight key us and european delegates were not present - still negotiating separately over their differences
conference president juan mayr who set a deadline of friday night has said that he will not leave montreal without an agreement
somebody has to give in somewhere said ethiopian head delegate towalde egziabher
negotiators were attempting to draft the biosafety protocol a set of rules that would protect the environment from damage by genetically modified plants animals and bacteria environmentalists and a few scientific studies have raised concerns that genetically modified organisms could wipe out native species disrupt natural cycles and cause other ecological damage
there's fish genes in fruit poultry genes in fish animal genes in plants growth hormones in milk insect genes in vegetables tree genes in grain and in the case of pork human genes in meat said steve gilman an organic farmer in stillwater ny real and reasonable concerns about genetic engineering have fallen upon deaf ears
the debate at the talks has revolved around how great the scientific uncertainty is and how it should be dealt with the european union and developing nations have argued that countries should be allowed to decline imports of a genetically modified product if little is known about its environmental effect
but the united states and its partners disagree saying the proposed rules in their current form would restrict trade those countries argued that any nation's refusal to import a genetically modified product should be backed by scientific evidence in the form of a risk assessment
we live in a world in which scientific certainty is not available said us undersecretary of state frank loy
talks last february in cartagena colombia ended in disarray when the united states and five other countries - canada australia argentina chile and uruguay - rejected a draft agreement favored by 125 other countries
the situation has changed since then with major us food producers such as archer daniels midland gerber and the iams pet food company either demanding that genetically modified products be segregated or refusing to use them altogether protests at the world trade organization talks in seattle last month also suggest that the american public has concerns about genetically altered food
in the year since cartagena it has become obvious that the position of the united states' group is increasingly isolated said philip bereano a university of washington professor who has been following the talks
just as in cartagena the talks in montreal have come down to a handful of issues
the relationship of the proposed rules to the world trade organization the united states wants the agreement to have equal status with the free trade pact but other countries fear that any bans they impose will be overturned by the world trade organization's dispute resolution panel
the amount of scientific evidence that is needed to justify banning a genetically modified product
the amount of evidence that exporters must provide about their products
genetically modified crops are already widespread about 70 million acres of genetically engineered plants were cultivated worldwide in 1999 in the united states genetically engineered varieties account for about 25 percent of corn and 40 percent of soybeans
some say it's just trash talk but a city councilman says the fresh kills garbage dump on staten island is the perfect spot for the new york jets own field of dreams
everything falls right into place councilman jay o'donovan said friday the dump closes in 2001 the jets' lease at the meadowlands complex is up in 2008 we get a few years in between to build a state-of-the art stadium it is the right time and this is the right place
the 3000 acre landfill - the world's largest - is scheduled to close in december 2001
mayor rudolph giuliani who had been pushing manhattan's west side as the site of a new baseball stadium for the new york yankees recently said it would make a great place for the jets too
but o'donovan said the dump idea is a lot more feasible this seems like it could go a lot easier the land is here it's available there's good highway access four bridges on paper it looks very very good
not everyone agrees
a spokesman for the mayor ed skyler says federal and state regulations prohibits permanent structures to be built on the landfill for at least 20 years and staten island borough president guy molinari who lobbied hard to get a minor league stadium for the staten island yankees said a professional football stadium that attracts 78000 fans would create traffic chaos
o'donovan admitted that traffic congestion would be a problem but urged the mayor and borough president not to immediately rule out his proposal
if this mayor wanted it the democratic councilman said it could be done
getting the jets back from new jersey where they have shared giants stadium since 1984 is something every new yorker would like to see
offers to help gang green find a new home have been popping up since the team was bought from the estate of the late jet owner leon hess for $635 million by pharmaceutical heir robert wood johnson iv
johnson made it clear he intends to get the jets their own stadium
asked about the domed dump suggestion jets spokesman doug miller said mr johnson has said the new york jets will consider all proposals for a new stadium in due time
o'donovan's proposal was first reported friday by the staten island advance in a story that began if you build it will they gag
as for the smell o'donovan said the jets current home at the meadowlands complex in east rutherford nj was built on wetlands next to a landfill i don't hear anyone complaining o'donovan says
it seems this wide spot in the road has always had desert heat but it also has the legendary bun boy restaurant and the world's tallest thermometer
they are familiar monuments to anyone who has ever made the hot dusty desert run along interstate 15 to las vegas
now the monuments have a new owner
this place has been here for decades and i can't imagine them changing it said marti schmidt a retiree from thousand oaks who stops at the bun boy on the way to and from las vegas with her husband al
she needn't worry
the history will remain said new owner steve carter
after all the bun boy restaurant has been pulling people in for nearly three-quarters of a century
the bun boy founded in 1926 and its 134-foot-tall thermometer were among the core properties sold last week to carter who declined to disclose the sum his company paid
the sale marks the first time the restaurant has completely changed hands
i'm glad it's done said seller willis herron 75 a friend of carter my age and my health wouldn't let me do baker justice
i think he'll do what i wanted to do but i ran out of time herron who is facing triple-bypass heart surgery and suffers from emphysema became a partner with the original bun boy owner in the 1950s
he said none of his six children wanted to keep the restaurant which draws visitors from as far away as germany and asia
the bun boy is widely considered the cornerstone of a growing community
baker isn't even a city it's an unincorporated community of san bernardino county with a population of about 600 people surrounded by scrub brush dry desert sand and hard brown mountains
it's only 90 miles from las vegas and it survives on traffic from adjacent interstate 15 in turn the bun boy and a handful of other fast-food shops and gas stations provide a welcome respite to travelers too tired to do another 90 miles on an oppressively hot summer day of which there are plenty in these parts
the strip of about 30 businesses that line baker boulevard did $33 million in sales last year said le hayes general manager of the baker community services district
besides buying stuff gawkers come by to snap pictures of the thermometer that was erected in 1991 and which can record temperatures exceeding 130 degrees
as tourists stop for refreshments gas and picture taking a continual parade of big-rig trucks rumbles down the town's main drag
traffic is so heavy that several restaurants have sprung up in recent years and more motels and fast-foods stops are planned the community that bills itself as the gateway to death valley may be enlarged by a third in the next year or so hayes said
and as the community grows many residents who know herron and have watched him raise a family here are sad he won't be a part of the boom
this is the man who started it all said hayes he started from the old days and built himself a small empire
carter's company purchased about 100 acres of that small empire including a gas station the old country store and two motels
carter 50 who owned several burger king franchises until this year said he hopes to expand his new properties but he won't change the bun boy or the thermometer
bun boy has great food said retiree schmidt it's all homestyle kind of food rather than fast food great strawberry pies
i can't imagine that they would change anything about it
like most lingerie companies undercoverwear offers a range of underthings from naughty to nice when they decided to donate to the homeless they chose function over fashion - thousands of flannel nightgowns
a national homeless coalition spurned the offer along with a gift of $200000 the bottom line undercoverwear exploits women the coalition said
the tewksbury-based business planned a february nightie for the needy campaign to donate 20000 flannel nightgowns plus $200000 to homeless shelters across the united states and canada
debbi karpowicz company spokeswoman said the washington-based national coalition for the homeless seemed excited when the idea was first proposed several weeks ago
but when undercoverwear called back recently to go over details the coalition's executive director mary ann gleason refused to participate
she basically said to me there was no way they were ever going to get involved with us karpowicz said friday they felt undercoverwear exaggerated wealth and exploited women
the 23-year-old company sells its underwear through 1500 sales agents who host lingerie parties similar to tupperware parties
their motto is we use supermoms not supermodels and products range from plaid nightgowns to skimpy panties
at its peak in the 1980s the company had annual sales of $75 million in the mid-1990s however sales were in the $25 million to $30 million range said company president tiffany james who wouldn't disclose current figures citing ongoing litigation
as a self-promotional gimmick to generate donations james proposed having women send in pictures of themselves wearing their ugliest nightgowns for each picture received the company would donate a new nightgown - worth about $40 retail - plus $1 to a shelter the company would make up any difference to reach its goal of 20000 nighties and $200000
gleason said undercoverwear didn't meet her criteria for accepting financial support she said she objected to the ugliest nightgown gimmick it just felt weird to me
she also took issue with the company's promotional materials which boast of the mansion and vacation homes owned by the company president it was too big a disconnect gleason said
gleason said she urged undercoverwear to call individual shelters in part because her agency had no means to distribute the nightgowns and money
karpowicz however said gleason's tone was anything but encouraging
the company said it was talking to another national homeless activist group about helping out but it wouldn't disclose the group's name
social service agencies can walk a fine line in deciding what donations are acceptable said philip mangano executive director of the massachusetts housing and shelter alliance a coalition of 73 agencies across the state
some shelters won't take money from liquor companies for example since alcoholism is often a cause of homelessness
but mangano said scrutiny can go too far
what gives an organization the right to say no to any donation that's intended for homeless people he said
there are an estimated 700000 homeless in america
a 28-year-old woman who asked that her name not be used picked a new blue hat wool socks and thick gloves out of a donation box at a boston homeless shelter friday
it doesn't matter to me where they come from she said when told of undercoverwear's offer
she said she could use a warm nightgown she also wouldn't mind a little something else
hey we'd take fancy lingerie stuff too the woman said we want to live like other women do
having performed in front of hundreds of millions of people over her career tina turner is not afraid of singing in front of that many in one night
at friday's news conference held to introduce the pregame entertainers for sunday's super bowl turner said she treats singing in front of a huge audience as a chance to get reacquainted
i used to be nervous but as the years have gone by it has turned to excitement and the feeling that it's a kind of reunion said the 60-year-old entertainer besides this is not about me it's about the guys i'm just decoration and just there to root them on
the game televised by abc is expected to draw a tv audience of 130 million in the united states alone
turner will perform a song from her new album as well as her classic proud mary during sunday's pregame billed as a tribute to 20th century music
before meeting the press she chatted with some of the tennessee titans giving them special wishes a few kisses and hugs
because she was born in the tennessee community of nutbush she said she would be rooting for the titans even though she also spent a few years in st louis
it was a great place to grow up turner said of her hometown immortalized in her hit nutbush city limits
country star faith hill on tap to sing the national anthem had a little different attitude about nerves when it comes to singing before an international tv audience
i'm just trying to remember the first two words said hill who is married to fellow country star tim mcgraw if i can get past oh say then i'll be ok
hill also will be rooting for the titans especially since the mississippi native now makes nashville her home
during the pregame native georgian and fellow country star travis tritt will also perform along with several other acts including georgia tech's marching band
country music has become worldwide said hill and the super bowl can reach so many people i was incredibly flattered when the nfl asked me to do this
madonna had committed to perform a version of don mclean's classic american pie for the pregame show but backed out earlier this month
the halftime show will feature phil collins christina aguilera enrique iglesias and toni braxton
the show titled tapestry of nations marks the sixth time walt disney has produced the event it will feature an 80-member orchestra puppets a choir and advanced pyrotechnics
the smothers brothers are hosts for the pregame show and dick smothers said they actually taped an introduction for madonna
that's probably the rarest piece of video out there right now he said that is sure to be a collector's item
prosecutors have worked out a deal with a couple who surfaced this week after nine months on the run with their 18-month-old son a boy the parents say suffers from a rare brittle bone disease not child abuse
wally hines iii 31 and his wife debby 32 returned to minnesota with their son wyatt on wednesday they made a brief court appearance friday were released without bail and allowed to keep their son
the parents who lived in suburban rosemount were never charged with child abuse but with depriving the county of its custodial rights and interstate flight to avoid prosecution the federal flight charges are being dropped
the state charges will be dismissed oct 30 if the parents stay out of trouble with the law continue to cooperate with authorities on care for the child and if the boy remains in good health dakota county attorney james backstrom said
they're very happy they wanted to come home said john whitehead president of the rutherford institute a charlottesville va-based legal advocacy group that helped negotiate their return
the hineses and their defenders always denied that wyatt was the victim of abuse and maintained that authorities overreacted to his injuries
the family says wyatt suffers from osteogenesis imperfecta a genetic disease that affects some 20000 to 50000 americans or about 1 in 20000 they say that's what explains the broken leg and broken ribs that first brought wyatt to authorities' attention
because of a court-imposed gag order it was unclear if prosecutors were still disputing the diagnosis social workers have said they thought the injuries were caused by the parents
officials with the osteogenesis imperfecta foundation in gaithersburg md say it's common for social workers to conclude that oi children are victims of abuse the group said the condition can be difficult to diagnose
wyatt's problems were noticed when he was 6 weeks old and his parents took him to a doctor with a swollen leg x-rays showed that his femur was broken in two places when child protection workers ordered more x-rays doctors found six broken ribs and wyatt was put in foster care for three months where he suffered more fractures
wyatt was returned to his mother after the father agreed to live away from their home for four weeks shortly before a final hearing in may wyatt's femur broke again they fled april 27 after learning police were coming to take wyatt away because of the injury
i think they feel that things have worked out about as well as could be expected said wally hines jr wyatt's grandfather i didn't think they would have come back otherwise to tell you the truth
cuban president fidel castro says elian gonzalez' mother was practically kidnapped by her boyfriend and intimidated into leaving for the united states countering claims that she was on a flight to freedom with her 6-year-old son
many who want elian to remain in the united states say his mother elisabeth brotons was trying to bring him to freedom in a voyage across the straits of florida that ended with shipwreck she and 10 others drowned and elian was left floating alone in an inner-tube
but castro speaking to a conference of economists friday denounced that idea he blamed the tragedy on brotons' boyfriend lazaro rafael munero who apparently organized the ill-fated journey in late november in which he also died
the mother was practically kidnapped along with the boy to make the trip castro said the mother was taken in conditions of intimidation
castro called munero a ruffian on whom cuban police had amassed 100 pages of reports
according to sources quoted by the miami herald munero - who reportedly drove a taxi in the cuban city of cardenas - had fled to florida in june 1998 and returned to cuba later that year only to be jailed for several months
castro called brotons an excellent girl who had suffered seven miscarriages before delivering elian
one who is born among eight pregnancies how desired that child must be castro said brotons had separated from elian's father several years ago though both continued to see the child regularly
earlier friday tens of thousands of children took part in a government-organized rally in havana calling for the return of cuba's boy hero the rally friday also celebrated the birth of independence hero jose marti and called both martyrs
castro said cuba could carry on such protests - which have continued daily for two months - for 10 years
elian's grandmothers meanwhile were considering returning home to cuba after a week in the united states trying to win the boy's return said the rev joan brown campbell of the national council of churches the new york-based group has facilitated their travel and supports the boy's repatriation
the boy's great-uncle and other relatives in miami are fighting to keep him in the united states
the immigration and naturalization service has ruled elian should return to his father in cuba but its order has not been carried out because the federal government agreed to hold off until the miami relatives could challenge it in court
at a hearing friday in miami us district judge william hoeveler moved up to feb 22 from march 6 the date when he would hear arguments on whether the relatives' lawsuit should be dismissed
while a move in congress to grant the child us citizenship seemed to be faltering the nun who hosted a meeting between the boy and his grandmothers urged us attorney general janet reno on friday to let the boy stay in the united states
sister jeanne o'laughlin told reno in a meeting friday that she has come to believe separating elian from his florida relatives would be another traumatic loss for him after the death of his mother
reno a longtime friend of o'laughlin said she continues to support the ins's ruling for the boy's return
o'laughlin conceded to reporters i am no longer neutral in the elian question reno had chosen the nun as a disinterested party to host the grandmothers' visit with elian
in havana on friday tens of thousands of children flooded the plaza of the revolution to deliver a dual homage to marti and elian wearing red communist pioneer neckerchiefs children recited poems they wrote for elian
the communist party daily granma called elian a symbol of the crimes and injustices imperialism is capable of committing against an innocent
it compared the boy's image emblazoned on hundreds of thousands of t-shirts here with that of revolutionary icon ernesto che guevara one that will spread across the world and remain forever in our mind and in our hearts
in old havana hundreds of children marched around the parque central chanting we will save elian some girls wore construction-paper handcuffs - an apparent reference to the government's claim elian has been kidnapped
matthew scott has worked countless hours to be able to do things most people hardly think about
one year ago he became the first person in the united states to receive a transplanted hand he can now use it to write his name pour a glass of water deal cards and tie his shoes
scott who lives in absecon nj was in louisville this week for a checkup with the doctors who attached his new left hand
scott represents the pinnacle of what can be achieved in hand transplant said dr warren breidenbach one of the surgeons
at a news conference friday doctors showed a video of scott performing simple tasks the natural left-hander has some feeling in his fingertips can feel temperatures and is beginning to gain function in the small muscles of the hand breidenbach said
the surgeons said scott's determination to improve the hand's function through therapy has contributed to his success
scott 38 said friday that the progress with his new hand has eased much of his anger over losing the old one in a fireworks accident
a lot of those daily frustrations - the kind that would send a pen flying across the room - are gone now he said
scott who works as an administrator for an emergency medical center lost his left hand in 1985 he received the new hand last year in a 15-hour procedure at jewish hospital in louisville
scott's doctors say his transplanted hand will never have the complete function of a normal hand but he may still see some improvement over the next year
dr jon jones a transplant surgeon said there's still about a 50 percent chance that scott's immune system will reject the hand over the next 10 years
five people in the world are living with transplanted hands two of them had the surgery in france with the first receiving a hand in september 1998 two have had hands attached in china
scott has the best hand function of any done breidenbach said
a man with a history of domestic violence killed his wife and two children before turning the gun on himself police said

police said he apparently used a 9 mm pistol to kill diane tillery 27 christy tillery 8 and christopher clay tillery jr 6 the children were shot in their beds and each victim was shot once said police spokesman foster arnett

there's never been a minority head coach in the super bowl of course the odds are stacked against it
only two blacks minnesota's dennis green and tampa bay's tony dungy are among the 31 nfl head coaches so commissioner paul tagliabue found himself addressing a familiar issue friday as another title game approached
in particular tagliabue was grilled on the recent trend of coaches-turned-kingmakers designating a successor before even leaving their post
bill parcells did that in new york though bill belichick quit the jets after only one day dave wannstedt was elevated to the top job in miami as jimmy johnson retired
even the st louis rams who meet the tennessee titans in sunday's super bowl know who their coach will be after dick vermeil retires offensive coordinator mike martz is next in line though he probably won't get the job until 2002
belichick who now coaches the new england patriots is white so are wannstedt and martz ditto for dave campo dallas al groh jets and mike sherman green bay hired since the end of the regular season
but tagliabue speaking at his annual super bowl news conference defended the league's minority hiring record
the reality is that one-third of our coaches are african-americans the commissioner said including assistants in his figures
the growing number of coordinators are african-americans and to the extent that coaches are trying to designate an heir apparent i think you are going to see african-americans in that pipeline
tagliabue pointed out that the jets have just elevated maurice carthon to assistant head coach and that ted cottrell buffalo's defensive coordinator is well respected around the league
the commissioner doesn't believe minority candidates are denied a fair opportunity when a successor in named in advance
it might be a positive thing if people are doing that kind of long-range planning he said they might start looking at younger coaches i don't see that as a negative in terms of minority hiring frankly
on another issue tagliabue acknowledged the nfl is concerned about off-field crimes committed by its players but he also suggested those crimes are part of a deeper problem
i think our track record is better than society at large tagliabue said
the league's well-polished image has been sullied this season by a number of off-field arrests the most serious involved former carolina receiver rae carruth released by the panthers after he was charged with first-degree murder in the shooting death of his pregnant girlfriend
can we separate ourselves from society of course not tagliabue said we can't predict what nfl players will do any more than we can predict students shooting other students of workers shooting fellow workers
at this super bowl the hottest topic has been the cold weather both teams practiced in wintry conditions until friday when they moved to the georgia dome because of an approaching storm that brought snow and ice to much of the deep south
you certainly won't hear the titans or rams complaining about the lack of headline material they're here to play for a championship not stir controversy
tennessee coach jeff fisher said his wild-card titans 16-3 had an excellent workout friday though receiver derrick mason and safety blaine bishop came to blows in the final session
bishop was covering mason on a pass in a two-minute drill when the ball fell incomplete mason accused the safety of hitting him in the helmet
afterwards fisher spoke privately with bishop and mason for several minutes the players hugged before leaving the field
it's over with the coach said they compete they are highly competitive that happens over the course of the season did you see them walk off the field together those two are about as competitive guys as i've got
the rams 15-3 didn't let jeff wilkins didn't test his sore left knee at practice but he will be their kicker on sunday nick lowery who tried out in st louis before the nfc championship game is in atlanta just in case
we spoke to him a couple of times this week and he was very close to getting a call coach dick vermeil said but jeff kicked well yesterday and his knee felt a lot better
the titans are still hoping to have receiver yancey thigpen who has a hairline fracture in his right foot he has not practiced all week but was not among the first group of players deactivated for the super bowl
nfl commissioner paul tagliabue sees off-field crimes committed by its players as part of a problem in society not just in pro football
can we separate ourselves from society of course not tagliabue said friday at his annual super bowl news conference
we can't predict what nfl players will do any more than we can predict students shooting other students or workers shooting fellow workers
but he added
on the other hand we don't tolerate violence we don't condone it
the nfl's well-polished image has been sullied this season by a number of off-field arrests
the most serious are the charges against carolina wide receiver rae carruth for conspiring the shooting death of cherica adams who was pregnant with their son carruth was released by the panthers after the charges were lodged
another nfl player in trouble with the law is cecil collins then of miami who was charged in december with burglary that led louisiana to revoke his probation on a similar charge there when he was in college and he is now in a miami jail awaiting extradition
tagliabue noted that the nfl put in counseling programs under former commissioner pete rozelle and there is also counseling during a mandatory rookie orientation program
tagliabue addressed a wide range of subjects ranging from the hiring of minorities as head coaches to the possibility that some late-season games could be shifted to different times or dates to get teams that are unexpectedly successful on national television for example neither the st louis rams nor tennessee titans who will meet in sunday's super bowl were on monday night television this season
we're talking to the networks about it with mixed reaction tagliabue said i'm not sure it will be used next year but it's something to think about for the future
tagliabue acknowledge that minorities have not been getting as many head coaching positions as he would like with the firing of ray rhodes in green bay there are only two black head coaches dennis green in minnesota and tony dungy in tampa bay
the commissioner pointed out that the new york jets have just elevated maurice carthon to assistant head coach and that ted cottrell buffalo's defensive coordinator remains well respected around the nfl
i think we have people in the pipeline but in the long run it's the owner's decision on who to hire he said
tagliabue said he was pleased with instant replay after a slow start
he noted that the call late in the nfc championship game overruling a catch by tampa bay's bert emmanuel was what the system was reinstituted for - crucial calls in major games
hype and anticipation mounted in atlanta - for the super bowl of course and for a winter storm that took its time arriving
early today a light coat of freezing rain was falling on the area the national weather service backed off on its predictions of snow but said freezing rain followed by sleet and rain showers would fall
given an entire week to prepare for the storm the nfl all but guaranteed the super bowl would be played
all the plans are the same nfl vice president of special events jim steeg said we just have to keep a sense of flexibility and be ready for whatever happens
the league took several precautions to make sure the game would go on including
piling sand outside the georgia dome in case ramps and entryways become slick
rescheduling a rehearsal for the pregame show in the georgia dome so both teams could hold their final full practices indoors friday
stationing workers on the georgia dome roof to brush off snow or excess water should it accumulate
making sure all the food and drinks arrive at the stadium early to prevent delivery trucks from having to negotiate slick roads
placing 16 power generators at the georgia dome to provide emergency energy should ice and snow knock out power to the downtown area
james peters of georgia power says downtown atlanta is networked for power underground
it's very very rare that an outage occurs peters said if an outage does occur we do have contingency plans in place
those traveling to the game started making contingency plans as well
anticipating nasty weather delta airlines canceled a handful of flights including four from nashville to atlanta the most popular route for titans fans
the decision left travel agencies in tennessee scrambling
it doesn't make a whole lot of sense to me said suzette bertuccelli manager of embassy travel in nashville they usually don't cancel until inclement weather hits we've just gotten a couple of calls this morning from people wanting to get protected on another flight
some who made it in from other cities felt fortunate
all the flights after ours were canceled said todd benson who was traveling with friends from kansas city mo
reservation managers at two large downtown hotels the hyatt and marriott said the number of room cancellations through friday were negligible
the nfl has no plans to redistribute tickets that aren't picked up
the league isn't really in a position to do that steeg said now if coke learns that half its group isn't going to make it in it's their decision
but steeg doesn't anticipate seeing a half-empty georgia dome come sunday
he recalled the 1987 super bowl when the giants played the broncos in pasadena calif and a giant snowstorm closed airports in the new york area in the days leading up to the game
the rose bowl was brimming and hardly any giants fans missed the game
hotels and everyone else are good at adjusting to what needs to be done with that steeg said people will adjust too they've got four days to get here and they'll find a way that's what it amounts to
uprooted unwanted and unstable neil o'donnell has survived an odyssey that might sound familiar to his teammates
the titans' backup quarterback knows what it's like to go month to month never quite sure where he'll be playing next
and just like his teammates he was pleased and surprised this season when he found himself wearing a funky new uniform playing in a glimmering new stadium and unexpectedly preparing for the franchise's first super bowl
it's the nature of the business these days o'donnell said it's a world of free agency people move around it seems like every year was a different year for me whether it was a salary-cap thing or a team was going in another direction that's just how it's been for me
the titans are o'donnell's fourth team in five seasons
he was the starter at pittsburgh for the better part of five seasons and was at the helm when the steelers made the super bowl in 1995
in a familiar refrain for steelers fans o'donnell became a free agent after his most successful season in pittsburgh the jets offered him $25 million and o'donnell's whirlwind began
his first season in new york was mired by bad luck and bad football he played in only six games his season coming to an end when he suffered a leg injury after slipping on the jets logo in the end zone during pregame warmups
the next season bill parcells replaced rich kotite as coach and o'donnell started 14 games but never won the demanding coach's trust
a season in cincinnati followed o'donnell started 11 games in place of the injured jeff blake and recorded a 902 quarterback rating but when the bengals drafted akili smith it was obvious they were moving in another direction
in stepped the titans looking for an insurance policy for steve mcnair when mcnair ruptured a disc in his back before week 2 this season the policy paid off
a big part of the success of this season was neil's ability to come in and in a very short period of time learn our offense and start coach jeff fisher said it says an awful lot about neil o'donnell his ability and his capabilities to play in this league
o'donnell went 4-1 as the starter completed 595 percent of his passes and helped the titans get off to the start they had to have after opening the previous seasons at 1-3 and 1-4
while the media and some fans were clamoring for a quarterback controversy upon mcnair's return to health o'donnell played it cool and accepted his role
the role this week has changed a 10-year veteran he's the voice of experience for tennessee which has only three players besides himself who have ever played in a super bowl
neil has stepped up like a true pro and won games for us tight end frank wycheck said obviously he's been successful in this league he's been to a few championship games he's been to the super bowl he knows what it takes to win
who knows if the love affair will continue
at the core o'donnell is a realist he's been set aside before for quarterbacks younger and more talented he knows what a big role the bottom line can play in this league
he says he'd like to return to tennessee next season undoubtedly the titans would love to have him
but he still has the urge to start in the nfl and of course to make as much money as he can to close his wandering career
it gets harder after a while especially when you have a family and kids in school o'donnell said but when you look at the season we had - i played a lot earlier this year learned the system real quick and contributed we made it to the super bowl i think this was the right move
fifteen finalists including joe montana and ronnie lott awaited the vote for the pro football hall of fame
montana and lott longtime teammates and the offensive and defensive cornerstones of four san francisco 49ers super bowl championship teams were the only candidates to make the list of finalists in their first year of eligibility
together they led the 49ers to nfl championships in 1982 1985 1989 and 1990 before finishing their careers with other teams montana with kansas city and lott with the los angeles raiders and new york jets
montana was a three-time super bowl mvp and never threw an interception in 122 attempts he holds six super bowl passing records including 11 career touchdown passes 357 yards passing against cincinnati in 1989 and 1142 career yards passing
lott was an eight-time all-pro at cornerback strong safety and free safety and holds the nfl postseason record with nine interceptions he recorded 100-plus tackles five times in a 14-year career
they were the top candidates being considered by the selection committee of 38 writers and broadcasters who will choose between four and seven new members for the canton ohio shrine election requires support from 80 percent of the voters
other finalists included defensive end howie long and wide receiver lynn swann both among the top six in last year's balloting and automatically returned for consideration long had 84 career sacks in 13 seasons with the raiders in oakland and los angeles swann a super bowl mvp played on four championship teams in six years with the pittsburgh steelers and held the super bowl career receiving yards record of 364 yards when he retired
joining them on the list of modern players to be considered were linebacker harry carson tight end dave casper defensive end carl eller wide receiver james lofton guard mike munchak wide receiver john stallworth offensive tackle ron yary and defensive end jack youngblood
carson reached nine pro bowls in 13 seasons with the new york giants casper spent 11 seasons with the raiders houston oilers and minnesota vikings and caught 378 passes for 5216 yards and 52 touchdowns eller and yary were teammates on four minnesota super bowl teams
lofton was the first nfl player to score touchdowns in three decades and caught 764 passes for 14004 yards and 75 tds in 16 seasons with five teams stallworth was swann's receiving partner on the steelers' four super bowl teams and caught 537 passes for 8723 yards and 63 tds
munchak the offensive line coach of the tennessee titans played in nine pro bowls in 12 seasons with the franchise when it was in houston youngblood missed only one game in 14 years with the los angeles rams and played 201 consecutive games a rams record
also on the ballot were coach marv levy who took the buffalo bills to four consecutive super bowls pittsburgh steelers owner and administrator dan rooney and old-timer nominee dave wilcox a linebacker with the 49ers from 1964-74 who was selected for seven pro bowls
players must be retired five years to be eligible for the hall of fame coaches become eligible as soon as they leave the sidelines and administrators can still be active old-timer nominees must have completed 70 percent of their careers by 1975 and automatically advance to the final seven candidates
the hall of fame induction at canton is scheduled for july 29
it's safe to say mike martz' second interview with the st louis rams went a lot better than the first
when dick vermeil was hired in 1997 he talked to the displaced staff as a courtesy then he swept them out including martz the silver-haired former quarterbacks coach
fast forward to the eve of the super bowl martz is next in line for the job when vermeil retires probably after the 2001 season and thinking what a funny business he's in
i didn't know him well enough to know he'd be able to do the job he's done vermeil said you don't get better without taking risks he has exceeded my expectations
martz 48 transformed the rams 15-3 from a 27th-rated humdrum offense into the third-highest scoring team in nfl history he dazzled defenses with a bewildering variety of formations that provide freedom for mvp quarterback kurt warner and marshall faulk the league's offensive player of the year
martz has been inventive bold decisive
i've heard the mad scientist term guard adam timmerman said he's kind of got the image of that on the offensive line you can sense they opponents are a little off-balance they don't know what you're going to do
every week martz tries to come up with something new like bunching four wideouts on the left side of the field and then throwing to the right or going for it all on the first play as the rams did with warner's 77-yard touchdown strike to isaac bruce against the minnesota vikings in their first playoff game
he puts together a brilliant package wide receiver az-zahir hakim said he knows personnel and what to do with the style of people we have on the team
he's also off the market removing perhaps the team's biggest distraction in the playoffs as speculation swirled about martz's future the team made a surprise announcement that tied their most marketable assistant to the team a few days before the rams routed the vikings 49-37
it's a huge relief martz said it was a distraction that just wasn't good for anybody it wasn't good for the team it certainly wasn't good for me and i'm just happy to have it over with
the well ran dry last week in the rams' 11-6 grind-it-out victory over the tampa bay buccaneers in the nfc championship game
faulk was stuck in the starting blocks held to 49 total yards warner wasn't sharp and a lot of his quick outs were floaters exposing the rams' smallish receivers to big hits from the bucs' defense rookie torry holt left in the first quarter with bruised ribs then again in the third quarter with a shoulder injury and az-zahir hakim missed time due to dehydration
the plays began to come in late because martz was missing some key weapons the genius was scrambling out of the pocket and the rams had to burn three timeouts
i wasn't quite sure who was in the huddle martz said we were trying to get a guy in and out and it threw me off
not permanently of course warner caught the bucs in a safety blitz and his 30-yard touchdown pass to ricky proehl throughout his career a possession receiver put the rams in their first super bowl in 20 years
afterward martz admitted to a case of nerves
i think we all had jitters he said i had the jitters i can tell you that
in the super bowl martz promises it'll be back to high-flying
we like to be as aggressive as we can and sometimes a great defense won't let you do that martz said we're not going to change how we run things

pregame dating a houston man bitter over the oilers' move to tennessee four years ago was willing to go to absurd lengths to get some revenge
hefty 34-year-old ronald salazar donned makeup women's clothing and a huge false chest friday to become a contestant in a dating game at houston's gallery furniture warehouse the prize was a trip with a furniture salesman to see the st louis rams and tennessee titans in the super bowl one of six tickets the store gave away
man we could have had a good time the disappointed salazar shouted at the salesman after being passed over for real women
consoled by door prizes salazar later laughed about his stunt
i told them hey the super bowl is better for a guy he said
the former oilers fan had strong personal reasons for wanting to go to the big game
i want to see the rams whip the titans he said it was hard for me when the oilers moved to tennessee now i'm just glad they're gone

sage advice a member of the st louis media said the rams stopped losing when he started burning sage as a good-luck charm
howard balzer of pro football weekly and all-sports station kfns said he got the idea from a psychic who told him before the season that the team was surrounded by negative energy brought from somewhere else the rams moved from anaheim calif in 1995
he's been burning the herb before kickoff since the final preseason game and the rams are 15-3 after going 4-12 last season
it works balzer said i don't know why but it works
balzer's practice almost got him into trouble earlier this week at the nfl media center which has a no-smoking rule security personnel smelled the odor and suspected someone was smoking marijuana
balzer said he escaped detection by quickly extinguishing the sage and shoving it under a table
cris carter of the minnesota vikings is the first recipient of the walter payton nfl man of the year award honoring the memory of the league's all-time rushing leader
carter a seven-time pro bowl choice was cited friday for his work with inner-city school children and other community activities
with payton's widow connie and brother eddie beside him carter called the award a tremendously humbling experience
he was arguably the greatest player and the greatest competitor in the league carter said referring to payton who died nov 1 at age 45 to receive an award named after him is tremendous
payton was the 1977 winner of the award
carter said payton had an impact on the players who followed him into the nfl
i watched randy moss put no 34 on his shoes every game and the nfl fined him $5000 every game carter said he did what he wanted to do walter payton's spirit lives on forever
league spokesman greg aiello said moss had been fined $5000 once for waving a towel with 34 on it during a monday night game there was a league-wide moment of silence and the clubs were advised that no team other than the bears should independently wear a decal or a patch he said
carter has been a mentor to many younger vikings players including moss and robert griffith he said he was at risk at one time in his career struggling with chemical dependency and marriage problems when he was claimed on waivers by the vikings
when i came into this league i was a little boy he said now i am a man the vikings gave me a new life
he said he embraces the chance to change lives
young people are looking for role models he said we can make an impact we can make a difference in people's lives it's time to stand up make our stand that we can be different and make good choices
carter second in nfl history with 101 touchdown receptions and fourth in career receptions with 834 said there were 15 or 20 players in the league who could have won the award
a lot were deserving he said i'm ever so thankful they selected me i wish i could be playing in the super bowl but nothing replaces this award fewer people win this
dick vermeil's weepiness might be getting contagious
stan kroenke who owns a third of the st louis rams warned players after practice friday that he might choke up - the way their coach often does
i told them bear with me because i've been around dick for three years and i get a little emotional but i know from being around dick it's ok' kroenke said
that drew a laugh from rams players who then gave kroenke a sendoff with their team chant stan gotta go to work
the team practiced for 90 minutes in the georgia dome a workout delayed at the start for 15 minutes while the tennessee titans finished the titans began their workout late so the dome could be checked for spies
i wasn't in a hurry vermeil said
kicker jeff wilkins didn't test his sore left knee but will be the rams' kicker on sunday nick lowery who tried out in st louis before the nfc championship game is in atlanta and brought his kicking shoes just in case
we spoke to him a couple of times this week and he was very close to getting a call vermeil said but jeff kicked well yesterday and his knee felt a lot better
center mike gruttadauria was back at practice after skipping the previous day with the flu
inactives were defensive end lionel barnes linebacker troy pelshak running back justin watson and offensive tackle matt willig wide receiver chris thomas who was on the early list last week was left active for now in case torry holt can't go holt suffered rib and shoulder injuries in the nfc championship game and was probable
as he has often done in the past vermeil railed against the nfl policy that requires a team to sit down eight players especially for a super bowl
it's absolutely ridiculous he said
the rams will have a brief walkthrough at the dome on saturday
one is a grizzled oil man shuffling toward sunset with long gray hair dangling over his ears and memories uncluttered by political correctness
the other is a blonde ex-vegas showgirl in a good ol' boys world married seven times and at ease walking the sideline in slingback pumps
bud adams
georgia frontiere
two carpetbaggers who reached the super bowl promised land together this year
i knew we were going to get there some day but i wasn't sure when it would be said adams owner of the tennessee titans and their previous incarnation the houston oilers for 40 years i didn't want to get there in a wheelchair i wanted to be standing up on both feet
frontiere assumed control of the los angeles rams in 1979 after one of her husbands carroll rosenbloom drowned in a riptide off the coast of florida she was the nfl's only female owner then two decades and a new city later she's still a loner in that regard
while she seems to have taken a hands-off approach in recent years the rams insist frontiere has remained active in running the team since it moved to st louis
her role has been the same since i've been here rams president john shaw said she's consulted advised and participates in all major decisions
some of her methods have made frontiere an easy target for ridicule from the media astrology holistic healing numerology and cabbage patch dolls are just a few of her quirky tools
perhaps that is why she slipped quietly into atlanta while adams marked his arrival thursday with a rambling drawling laugh-filled news conference frontiere declined to take phone calls at the team hotel
she's not doing interviews this week team spokesman rick smith said she'll probably talk after the game
both owners are reticent about discussing their age adams is at least 77 while frontiere is more likely in the mid-to-late 60s
rams coach dick vermeil who met frontiere and rosenbloom in 1972 has gotten along well with her since taking the job three years ago
my experience with her said the ownership never interfered with the progress of the football team vermeil said i had no concern about not being supported
for both adams and frontiere the unlikely super bowl pairing is more than just a triumph
it's vindication
after the 1994 season frontiere abandoned the nation's no 2 television market and moved the franchise to her hometown st louis which promised a new domed stadium and almost $20 million in annual profit
the other owners angered with the idea of losing los angeles punished the rams by taking away their share of the expansion fees when cleveland and houston joined the league
houston lost its original team after a nasty feud between adams and the mayor when efforts to build a new stadium in texas fell through he packed up his venerable franchise in 1997 and took a sweetheart deal in the capital of country music
clearly not a student of relocation adams made one public-relations blunder after another his team had to spend its final year in houston as a lame duck then planned to play a couple of seasons in memphis while a new stadium was under construction in nashville
but attendance in memphis was awful and the people of nashville felt betrayed adams bumped up his timetable and took the team to vanderbilt's cramped stadium last season but he insisted on keeping the oilers name which didn't go over well in a state where the only drilling was done by jed clampett
the team didn't gain full acceptance until adelphia coliseum opened this season and adams surrendered his beloved oilers moniker in favor of titans or course he also got the nfl to retire the original nickname so it couldn't be used by another city such as houston
adams has no bad feelings against his team's former home in fact he still lives there and plans to purchase tickets when the new houston franchise begins play in 2002
i have a lot of friends in houston said adams who supposedly settled there in 1946 after his plane made a forced landing because of fog i'm not afraid to walk around anywhere in town people come up to me all the time and say hi bud
adams is not afraid to speak his mind either an original owner in the old afl he talks openly about doing whatever is necessary to sign a player whether it was lining up dates or promising a herd of cattle as a bonus
we had more fun in the old days adams said now you've got to have everything on the contract
while vermeil's rallying cry this season was taking georgia to georgia the titans felt a sense of urgency to get adams to the super bowl the oilers were an early power in the afl winning the first two titles but they went the next 37 years without a championship
that was my no 1 goal coach jeff fisher said not many people have come to know him very well he's misinterpreted i know he was misunderstood in houston the most important thing to him in life other than his family is getting a chance to play in this ballgame
after a lifetime of eccentricity frontiere finally seems at peace in her birthplace there are only scant memories of the time she fired her stepson steve rosenbloom as the rams executive vice president hardly anyone remembers the embarrassment of having her seventh husband dominic frontiere go to prison for income tax evasion after scalping super bowl tickets in 1980
when the rams defeated tampa bay in the nfc championship game frontiere circled the field blowing kisses to the crowd
st louis feels right frontiere told the st louis post-dispatch last week i feel i belong here i'm part of something really special this season
practice heated up for the tennessee titans and not just because they moved inside to the georgia dome
receiver derrick mason and safety blaine bishop came to blows in the final session of the 1-hour 40-minute practice friday bishop had been covering mason on a pass in a two-minute drill when the ball fell incomplete and mason accused the safety of hitting him in the helmet
the two started fighting and had to be separated by teammates mason and bishop didn't want to stop and were ordered off the field
following practice fisher pulled his players and coaches together for a talk then he spoke privately with bishop and mason for several minutes the players hugged and then left
it's over with fisher said they compete they are highly competitive that happens over the course of the season did you see them walk off the field together those two are about as competitive guys as i've got
practice was moved from georgia tech to the dome in anticipation of a winter storm hitting the city and the change allowed the titans to get used to the artificial turf
quarterback steve mcnair didn't take as many snaps as thursday when he handled about 80 percent of the drills but at least mcnair practiced something he didn't do a week ago before the afc championship due to a sore toe
receiver yancey thigpen who has a hairline fracture in his right foot did not practice for a third straight day but he was not listed among the first group of players deactivated for sunday's super bowl those players were guard zach piller linebacker phil glover center craig page and safety marcus robertson who broke his leg last week
overtime losses will count both as a loss and a regulation tie

president clinton joined an annual economic forum here today in a whirlwind visit to urge world business and political leaders to heed labor and environmental concerns in the global economy
it is the first time an american president has attended the world economic forum bringing to a new high the us profile at what began 30 years ago as an informal gathering of economic elites in this alpine resort
top administration officials and leading members of congress and state governments have routinely attended the forums but the clinton entourage makes this the biggest us delegation yet a forum spokeswoman said
one organizer quipped there will be more members of the us cabinet here than there usually are in washington they include secretary of state madeleine albright commerce secretary william daley treasury secretary lawrence h summers and energy secretary bill richardson as well as other top clinton administration officials
clinton's plane touched down at zurich airport shortly after 2 am est airport officials said he planned to stay only a few hours in switzerland
undaunted by threats of anti-free trade demonstrations clinton was expected to return in his speech today to the same theme he addressed in seattle last month the need to include worker rights and environmental safeguards in global trade talks
his audience in the alpine resort - nearly 2000 leaders of world corporations governments and academia - has already been urged by other top speakers - including british prime minister tony blair - to take steps in world trade that will allay the anxieties of people fearing a loss of jobs or income because of shifting investments
groups that oppose the closed meetings of the six-day forum and the megacorporations represented in davos plan to defy a swiss ban on demonstrations today they say the elite meeting has undue influence on the lives of people around the world
security in the narrow valley town has been tightened further with checks being made on people traveling into the resort by road or train the swiss army has been dispatched for the first time to act as reinforcements to police brought in from across switzerland
the session of the world trade organization in seattle late last year saw large demonstrations by opponents and some protests turned into violent clashes with police
clinton's views on trade coincide with those of many peaceful anti-wto protesters in seattle
the ideas clash however with those of many developing countries that regard the attempt to impose labor standards in trade agreements as being unfair interference in their affairs by rich nations and a new trade round will fail to go forward until it receives support from across the 135-member wto
albright's arrival friday started shifting the attention of the gathering to the search for solutions to regional tensions
she met separately with the foreign ministers of greece and turkey friday encouraging the cautious steps the two nato allies are taking to overcome decades of mistrust
officials said clinton and albright would be meeting with other leaders representing peoples involved in regional tensions or conflicts including the presidents of armenia and azerbaijan
albright also is to join clinton in a session with palestinian leader yasser arafat but israeli prime minister ehud barak on friday canceled his visit to the forum which ruled out a possible three-way meeting on middle east peace
not everyone in davos was thrilled by clinton's appearance at the forum bruno gerber the 13000-population town's tourism director said we are not ready and not big enough and not organized enough in such a small resort to have such an army of people just trying to secure one man
i'm quite glad that he's not going to stay here for a couple of days gerber told the associated press that would not be good for the resort
sleet and freezing rain fell in tennessee and northern georgia today while rain showers dotted parts of the southeast
sections of the south were under winter storm watches warnings and advisories presaging a possible day of freezing rain sleet and snow in many areas
such harsh conditions were expected from eastern iowa and missouri south into mississippi and east into florida and south carolina with anywhere from 3 inches to 6 inches of snow and locally heavy rain possible
in the east another day of bitter cold is expected as wintry conditions continue some lake effect snow showers were forecast for the northeast
a few lake effect snow showers were forecast for the northeast and skies were expected to be cloudy and dry across the region
much of the central united states is expected to have a day of partly to mostly cloudy skies and 1 inch to 3 inches of snow could fall in oklahoma arkansas missouri kansas nebraska and iowa light snow or flurries will be possible northward through the dakotas but little accumulation is expected
a day of pleasant weather is forecast for the west before a storm system is expected to move in from the pacific and spread rain and snow throughout the region on sunday partly cloudy skies are expected in most areas though light rain and snow showers are expected to develop across western and central california late saturday
highs today were forecast in the teens and 20s in the northeast the great lakes and the northern and central plains in the 30s and 40s in the mid-atlantic the southeast and southern plains 40s and 50s in the northwest and much of the west and 60s and 70s in the southwest and southern florida
extremes on friday across the lower 48 ranged from a high of 74 degrees in ft lauderdale fla to a low of -20 degrees below in watertown ny
even if sen john mccain wins the first-in-the-nation presidential primary gov george bush says his campaign for the white house remains strong
win or lose in new hampshire i will survive says bush the republican front-runner nationally
mccain will be battling this weekend to hold back bush and gain the victory his underdog presidential campaign needs the five-man republican field heads into the final days of campaigning before the voting tuesday
bush in a two-front fight against staunch conservative candidates on one side and the more moderate mccain on the other believed he was narrowing the gap aides said but they also said the texas governor might run out of time
there would have to be a sea change in voter attitudes for mccain to lose said ken khachigian one of the arizona senator's advisers
the majority of public polls friday gave mccain the lead but they also offered bush reason to hope conservative steve forbes was running a distant third still taking aim at bush
four days before the balloting the gop campaigns launched their get-out-the-vote drives and made final decisions on weekend tv ads unlike past years when negative ads were part of the closing-weekend dynamic the top-tier campaigns decided to keep their attack spots off the air unless a rival went first
though eleventh-hour attacks could still hit monday the reluctance to go negative suggested that mccain bush and forbes were focusing on turning out their supporters rather than trying to peel away their rivals' backers
absent any earth-shattering events this weekend it's all going to come down to turnout said bush spokesman ari fleischer
the texas governor said he had a very good chance of winning tuesday but whatever happens bush told reporters i'm in it for the long pull with a campaign well organized in primary states beyond new hampshire
mccain however can't afford to lose here his aides said with a fraction of bush's money and little support from the party establishment mccain's longshot strategy is to hobble bush in new hampshire and ride the momentum into later primary states
steve duprey new hampshire's republican party chairman said mccain was the man to beat but he sensed bush gaining ground
mccain has been leading in most polls using his strength among independents while a couple of polls have shown the race very close tracking polls which are sometimes unreliable showed bush gaining ground on mccain after wednesday's debate by getting increasing support from republicans
bush meanwhile was being squeezed from the right and left while mccain kept him occupied conservative voters were flirting with forbes alan keyes and gary bauer
the government has conceded for the first time that workers who helped make nuclear weapons were exposed to cancer-causing radiation and chemicals the new york times reported today
the findings that radiation exposure led to higher-than-normal and wide-ranging cancers in workers is detailed in a draft report prepared by the energy department and the white house the newspaper said
this is the first time that the government is acknowledging that people got cancer from radiation exposure in the plants energy secretary bill richardson told the times
in the past the role of the government was to take a hike richardson said and i think that was wrong
the admission raises the possibility that the government may eventually be forced to compensate families and survivors
the report said 22 different kinds of cancers including leukemia hodgkin's lymphoma prostate kidney and lung cancer were found among 600000 people who worked at 14 nuclear weapons plants since world war ii
since the manhattan project in 1957 when workers began handling radioactive material to produce atomic bombs the government has minimized workers' risks and spent millions defending itself in lawsuits
the energy department along with various agencies have been compiling data since july after richardson's agency concluded that some workers at weapons plants supplying beryllium developed beryllium disease an incurable lung ailment
president clinton ordered a broad study that would also look at the effects of radiation and chemical hazards from uranium plutonium and other substances
daniel j guttman an attorney for the paper allied-industrial chemical and energy workers union called the draft conclusions stunning guttman's firm represents employees at 11 weapons factories
the prior story line is what's the big deal the risks were marginal' he said
the findings come from epidemiological studies performed from as far back as the mid-1960s including many dismissed by the government when they were published
other information was gathered from the energy department which now owns the nuclear plants the atomic energy commission or their contractors the times said none of the research was specifically done for this study
the report is expected to be completed by march
among the sites noted in the report were several operations at oak ridge tenn savannah river in south carolina hanford in washington state rocky flats near denver the fernald feed materials center near cincinnati and at the lawrence livermore and los alamos national laboratories
more than 10000 shovels from around the country are being hauled into this northeast nevada town today as part of a protest against the us forest service
the shovels are a sign of support from loggers ranchers and miners across the country for local activists taking on the federal government in their fight to rebuild a road in the humboldt-toiyabe national forest
the fight over rebuilding the road has become a rallying cry for people in these parts fed up with the federal government
if they start to shut one road down then it will be another then another state assemblyman john carpenter said friday as pickup trucks full of shovels began to show up at his real estate office in elko
south canyon road was washed out in a flood in 1995 local residents had planned to rebuild it but a federal judge issued a restraining order last fall after forest service biologists said doing so would create silt and pollution runoff into the jarbidge river jeopardizing survival of the southernmost population of bull trout in the nation
the elko county commission claims the forest service has no jurisdiction over the road because it was there before the national forest was established in the early 1900s
resentment over federal control runs deep in rural nevada where the government owns 87 percent of the land the largest percentage in the country
nevada gov kenny guinn is among those who support the jarbidge shovel brigade parade protest planned down elko's main street today
sometimes the only way to get their attention is to stand up for our rights he said in a letter friday to carpenter
jim hurst a montana saw mill owner came up with the idea of collecting the shovels for the elko activists who want to reconstruct the road by hand this summer
a caravan of trucks picked up shovels along the way on an 800-mile trek from montana and idaho to nevada on thursday and friday
a fire truck and a half-dozen emergency vehicles with their lights flashing escorted the caravan into wells about 6 pm friday a dozen pickup trucks were loaded down with shovels along with a dump truck carrying an estimated 1200 shovels and a semi-trailer with 7000 to 8000 they'll head the last 50 miles west on interstate 80 to elko early today in time for the parade
the parade will end at the courthouse where a 30-foot shovel has been erected with 4000 names engraved in support of the jarbidge shovel brigade
authorities have arrested a man and his parents in the 1996 slaying of his ex-wife whose dismembered body was found floating in a lake by fishermen
grand jury documents allege the three shot and killed 23-year-old karyn hearn slover and that the two men tried to conceal the crime by cutting burning and destroying her body
michael k slover jr 29 and his parents michael k slover sr 53 and jeanette slover 52 were arrested without incident illinois state police sgt rory steidl said friday
they were arrested thursday just hours after the third grand jury to consider the case returned indictments against all three for first-degree murder
macon county state's attorney lawrence fichter would not discuss a possible motive or who he thinks fired the fatal shots karyn slover was shot five times in the head
fichter said he would ask the judge to deny bond for all three until trial
attorney sam cahnman who represented the younger slover during the grand jury proceedings said friday to the best of my knowledge my client is not guilty
calls to the office of the attorney representing the parents were not answered
karyn slover vanished sept 27 1996 she was last seen by co-workers at the decatur herald &amp review where she worked in the newspaper's advertising department she left the newspaper that day to pick up her 3-year-old son at her in-laws' home she was never heard from again
the car she was driving was found that night abandoned with the engine running 29 miles northeast of decatur on interstate 72 two days later fishermen found parts of her dismembered body in plastic bags in lake shelbyville - 41 miles away from where the car was left
the number of confirmed cases of shigellosis linked to varieties of bean dip has risen to 30 in california health officials said
state health director diana bonta on friday reiterated her warning against eating the dips sold under the brand names senor felix's five-layered party dip delicioso 5-layer dip trader joe's five-layered fiesta dip or the carryout cafe mexican fiesta party dip 5 layer
the manufacturer recalled the contaminated dip last week
they may be contaminated with shigella a serious - and highly contagious - type of bacteria that causes bloody diarrhea cramps fever nausea and vomiting
in addition to the california illnesses as least 22 cases have been reported in washington nine in oregon and one in idaho
the dips were manufactured by senor felix's gourmet mexican foods in los angeles and distributed nationwide primarily through costco and trader joe's the health department said
new york city officials could sense it the bad publicity the worse jokes
and so predictably officials with the city's human resources administration announced friday that welfare recipients could no longer apply for jobs with the psychic network through a city program
the telephone pay service offered clairvoyance at $499 a minute
though hra believes people should have the freedom to choose their own employment hra's business link has decided to not include the psychic network as one of its participating employers said a statement from jason a turner the agency's commissioner
the decision to pull the plug on the psychic connection came hours after the hiring policy was made public since last april network instructors had taught 15 welfare clients to read tarot cards and offer their callers a peek into the future
initially agency spokeswoman ruth reinecke said the jobs were odd-sounding but not strange at all
the pay is rather good and it's attractive to work out of the home for the mothers who have young children she said
the qualifications were a high school diploma and the ability to read write and speak english the pay started at $10 an hour plus bonuses the ability to see into the future was not a prerequisite
the city refused to provide any information about the psychic network citing a confidentiality agreement with companies that participate in the workfare program the plan attempts to lower the welfare rolls by finding jobs for recipients city officials say they have done that for 538000 people since 1996
the human resources offices received a large number of calls about the plan after the new york times first reported it a pittsburgh radio reporter trying to track down an agency spokeswoman said the report was the subject of great mirth in the steel city
a woman in the administration's offices friday was laughing when she answered another reporter's call is this about the psychics she intuitively inquired
the 900-number services are legal but are required to run a disclaimer that the calls are strictly for entertainment value
trying to track down the owner of the psychic network could require the use of tea leaves the only listing under the name is a florida bookstore that has no connection to the telephone business
there was no listing for the psychic network in new york
even if sen john mccain wins the first-in-the-nation presidential primary gov george bush says his campaign for the white house remains strong
win or lose in new hampshire i will survive says bush the republican front-runner nationally
bush's effort is to receive a boost today when former president bush travels to the state to endorse his son's presidential bid campaign aides said the former president has appeared in advance of his son in iowa new hampshire and south carolina but today will be the first time they've appeared together on the stump
earlier this week the bush camp picked up the endorsements of former housing secretary and vice presidential nominee jack kemp and of john sununu the former new hampshire governor and president bush's chief of staff
mccain will be battling this weekend to hold back bush and gain the victory his underdog presidential campaign needs the five-man republican field heads into the final days of campaigning before the voting tuesday
bush in a two-front fight against staunch conservative candidates on one side and the more moderate mccain on the other believed he was narrowing the gap aides said but they also said the texas governor might run out of time

a draft us government report says elevated cancer rates have been found among 600000 workers in the nation's atomic weapons plants since world war ii energy secretary bill richardson said today
the report requested by president clinton after the government concluded that workers at some of the plants may have suffered beryllium poisoning is the first acknowledgment by the government of a possible cancer link at the plants
it also increases the possibility that those exposed or their survivors might someday receive compensation from the government richardson indicated
it does appear that in the doe complex there is a direct link between exposure and the possibility of contamination richardson told the associated press and if that is the case the honorable thing for the government to do is to protect its workers past and present
richardson who accompanied clinton to davos for an address to the world economic forum cautioned that the report is preliminary and said the final version won't be ready until march
the report said elevated cancer rates were found among workers at 14 plants in the department's atomic weapons complex including leukemia hodgkin's lymphoma and prostate kidney salivary gland and lung cancers the new york times reported today
since the beginning of the manhattan project in 1943 that developed the first atomic bombs the government has minimized the risks to workers handling radioactive material at the plants

a fresh layer of ice caused hundreds of traffic accidents around northern georgia today as the region was slammed by a storm that had swept across the south with more than a foot of snow
one pileup early today involved 47 cars at the junctions of interstates 20 75 and 85 in atlanta where an ice storm a week earlier caused huge power outages
this latest storm had dumped up to 17 inches of snow in oklahoma earlier in the week with as much as a foot in arkansas mississippi alabama and tennessee in arkansas the weather was blamed for three deaths and one man was killed today on an ice-covered atlanta highway
it could be a very very serious time for us said phil badgett a forecaster at the national weather service in raleigh nc which got a record 2-foot snowfall a week ago
sleet and freezing rain fell early today in parts of alabama georgia and south carolina
the storm was expected to move out of georgia and into the carolinas in time for super bowl sunday that would be good news for atlanta with more than 100000 fans expected in town for the big game
all runways were open today at atlanta hartsfield international airport officials said delta air lines spokeswoman alesia watson said 35 percent of the day's flights have been canceled but we still have plenty of seats from st louis or nashville
police around the atlanta metropolitan area shut down many of the interchanges to interstate highways this morning because the pavement was so icy officers couldn't even walk on them
everyone needs to slow down said dekalb county police spokeswoman mikki jones we've had vehicles slide into 10 of our officer's cars
on friday president clinton approved a disaster declaration for 30 georgia counties because of the ice storm last week which left 500000 customers without electricity and caused an estimated $55 million in damage
in north carolina gov jim hunt asked clinton to declare 26 counties disaster areas rough 25000 utility customers throughout the state remained without power late friday
winter storm advisories were in effect across south and north carolina up to 4 inches of snow was expected today over the mountains and sleet and freezing were expected to last through sunday in parts of north carolina an ice storm warning was in effect for northeastern alabama today
while people prepared for the latest blast of winter evidence of monday night's 20-inch snowfall in raleigh nc remained everywhere a week of low temperatures kept the snow from melting and hampered road crews' efforts
john and karen bianchino loaded their pickup truck outside a raleigh supermarket with groceries for themselves and neighbors who couldn't get out they said the trip to the store took two hours because of slick roads
gery sandling emerged from a hardware store with what he could find on the depleted shelves - a bag of sand a flashlight spare batteries and a 2-by-4 to brace his carport roof
it worries us about the weekend sandling said we've already spent a lot of time digging out i've never seen anything like this
president clinton says congressional leaders from both parties will come to the white house to discuss his state of the union proposals including a plan to pay off the $36 trillion national debt
first and foremost i hope we can agree on my plan to pay down the debt entirely over the next 13 years and make america debt-free for the first time since andrew jackson was president in 1835 clinton said in his weekly radio address
the president said he wants to reserve a third of the projected federal surplus for debt reduction and a lower debt would free up interest payments that should be used to preserve social security
that will keep it strong and sound for 50 years and take in the life span of the baby boom generation he said
two days after delivering his 89-minute speech to congress clinton offered an abridged version of his final year's agenda a long wish list of projects ranging from passing a patients bill of rights to raising the minimum wage
clinton would create a new medicare prescription drug benefit and spend more on education scientific research and military pay
we must ensure that every child begins school ready to learn and graduates ready to succeed we must help every family succeed at home and at work clinton said we must do all of this while maintaining the fiscal discipline that brought us to this rare and promising moment we enjoy
clinton also wants congress to pass campaign finance reform and legislation dealing with gun-safety and hate crimes
giving the republican radio response rep jim nussle of iowa said the strong economy has left the government more money than it needs to save social security pay down the national debt and deal with other priorities he said the rest of the money should be returned to americans in the form of tax cuts
president clinton has already figured out how to spend most of that money for new government spending programs nussle said and that's before the ink was even dry on his big spending state of the union speech
a woman who once lobbied the white house for improved health insurance has been sentenced to prison for making her daughter so sick that the girl's gall bladder appendix and part of her intestines had to be removed
kathy bush who was convicted in october of child abuse and fraud was sentenced friday to five years in prison and another five years on probation
jennifer's illnesses and mounting medical bills garnered national attention when the girl and her mother went to the white house in 1994 to help lobby for health insurance improvements
jennifer sat beside first lady hillary clinton at the white house and both she and her mother testified at congressional hearings on health care costs
by 1996 when the state started its investigation jennifer had been hospitalized 200 times and had undergone about 40 operations doctors treated her for seizures infections and symptoms such as diarrhea and vomiting
prosecutors said bush 42 had munchausen syndrome by proxy a psychological disorder in which a parent causes illnesses in the child to get attention
i never harmed my daughter - physically emotionally psychologically or medically bush told the judge i love jennifer with all my heart and all my soul
prosecutors said bush gave her daughter excessive dosages of seizure medication tampered with her feeding machine and fabricated symptoms on her medical charts
a moroccan man detained after entering the united states from canada was being held as a material witness for the case against an algerian arrested with a car full of explosives the seattle times reported today
meanwhile a man suspected of plotting a bomb attack against the united states and who reportedly has links to the millionaire saudi arabian fugitive osama bin laden was arrested in the west african nation of mauritania security officials there said
youssef karroum was detained thursday at the border in northern washington state said harold malkin a us attorney's spokesman
a us magistrate judge on friday ordered that karroum be held as a material witness another court date for him was set for tuesday
federal officials treated the case with an unusual level of secrecy and would not say what alerted them to karroum or in which case he would be a material witness
however justice department sources told the seattle times that the case involves an investigation related to ahmed ressam the algerian arrested dec 14 in port angeles with a car full of explosives
karroum was arrested by agents from the immigration and naturalization service and the customs service who became suspicious about his documentation the times reported in addition a computer check showed that his name was red-flagged by the fbi the newspaper said
during a search of karroum's vehicle bomb-sniffing dogs reacted to traces of a chemical officials think may be the explosive nitroglycerin the times said however no bomb was found and law-enforcement sources said the dogs can be wrong and that further tests are required
law-enforcement officials told the times that they are unsure about where karroum fits in the investigation but said his arrest is part of a dragnet thrown over four continents
karroum's lawyer gene grantham said his client was not being held as a suspect he's being held to determine if he knows anything about other ongoing investigations grantham said
customs spokeswoman cherise miles referred calls to the us attorney's office
ressam has pleaded innocent to charges that he had been planning a terrorist bombing
in mauritania mohambedou ould slahi was arrested after leaving neighboring senegal on wednesday said security officials who spoke on condition of anonymity
slahi a mauritanian who had been living in canada left there in part because of the investigation into ressam the canadian security intelligence service said thursday
dan lambert a spokesman for canadian intelligence said slahi left canada sometime after authorities uncovered the alleged plot on dec 14 the same day ressam was detained
according to the new york times slahi's brother-in-law is one of bin laden's top lieutenants however a us law enforcement official said thursday on condition of anonymity that us investigators are unsure of this
investigators also are not sure if slahi was a major figure in the bombing plot or just a minor messenger the official in washington said
no specific evidence has been released linking bin laden to the newly alleged bombing plot authorities have not said what the targets of that plot might have been
us officials accuse bin laden a saudi believed to be living in afghanistan of masterminding the 1998 bombings of us embassies in kenya and tanzania those attacks killed 224 people including 12 americans
with 800 people packed into a school gymnasium to hear him speak and a handful more braving subfreezing weather to shake his hand john mccain soaked up the scene and said this is the highlight of my political life
these are dreamy days for the men who want to be president but there is anxiety too for some the verdict of the notoriously fickle new hampshire voters will spell the end of their candidacies - or signal the beginning of the end
mccain's outcome is critical unlike national front-runner george w bush mccain cannot afford to lose tuesday's primary
if bush puts mccain away in new hampshire the arizona senator may look back at friday's jam-packed town hall meeting and realize sadly that it was indeed the highlight
the stakes are highest for mccain said state gop chairman steve duprey but every candidate has something to accomplish before leaving new hampshire
the front-runners must avoid lengthy nomination fights the top challengers must strike quickly the also-rans must catapult themselves into the first tier
steve forbes the millionaire conservative paying for his own campaign finished a solid second in iowa's caucuses where mccain did not compete after billing new hampshire as a three-way race forbes needs to finish second or a close third for a decent return on his steep investment
the only poll that counts is on tuesday forbes said saturday at a manchester diner as mccain and bush led in voter surveys i would think that given what has happened so far this year you would look at polls with a bit of a skeptical eye
dreaming big he added i'm in through november and then i'll be taking the oath of office
on the democratic side vice president al gore rocked rival bill bradley in iowa's caucuses and could virtually end his threat with another big victory tuesday party leaders might start calling for bradley to step aside allowing gore to save his resources for the general election fight
the former new jersey senator however shows no sign of quitting tracking polls suggest he may have stopped his slide in new hampshire he has enough money to compete beyond the state and he already has scratched out a travel schedule through march 7 when a series of primaries are scheduled from new york to california
you go into a different kind of campaign it's a national campaign at that point bradley said
democrats have no delegate-awarding contests between new hampshire and march 7 giving tuesday's winner five weeks to build momentum and a sense of inevitability
inevitability has been bush's greatest political asset on the republican side with many of his supporters backing him because he seems the most likely to succeed in november losing new hampshire would suddenly make him vulnerable especially if he lost by more than a few percentage points
yet bush would still be the best-financed and best-organized candidate
i'm in it for the long pull bush said friday win or lose i will survive
mccain can't say the same thing
a significant defeat would strangle his candidacy in new hampshire a narrow loss would give him a moral victory and he would likely compete in the feb 19 south carolina primary
but that state favors bush as does follow-up contests in michigan and virginia even in his home state of arizona it's a close mccain-bush race those hurdles would be all but insurmountable unless new hampshire weakens bush
you have to win a primary to win the nomination mccain strategist mike murphy said
for lower-tier republicans staying in the race is a victory of sorts
alan keyes finished a distant third in iowa but did well enough to chase sen orrin hatch of utah from the race that may have been keyes' high point social conservatives are not much of a force in new hampshire and he doesn't have the money to compete in coast-to-coast primaries
conservative activist gary bauer nearly dropped out after losing to keyes but decided to give it another week the prospect of failure was hard to shake
chatting with a voter friday bauer explained that it costs $25000 a day to run a campaign we've got to do well next week he said because after a while you 
he shrugged not finishing the thought after a while you must stop dreaming
unthinkable until recently retiring the $36 trillion publicly held part of the national debt has become the crux of an election-year competition between president clinton and republicans in congress
eliminating the debt would further strengthen the economy but it may not be politically possible
questions about the issue
q what is the national debt and how big is it
a the national debt stands at $57 trillion
of that $36 trillion is the publicly held debt that is what the united states owes individuals pension funds foreign countries and others who lent it money over many decades and received treasury bills in return
most economists say this portion of the debt is most important because it drains funds that could otherwise flow to private companies reducing this debt unleashes more money for entrepreneurs which should mean lower interest rates higher productivity and a wealthier society
the remaining $21 trillion debt is money the government owes social security and other trust funds the social security administration the medicare system and other trust funds hold $21 trillion worth of treasury bills which the government owes itself so it can pay future benefits
q why do the politicians want to pay off the publicly held debt
a polls show the public prefers debt reduction to tax cuts and higher spending and clinton and congressional republicans are competing to be seen as champions of the idea debt reduction is not only popular it is now possible - arithmetically at least vast growing annual budget surpluses replaced deficits in 1998 and have been projected into the future
q what about paying off debt the government owes social security and other federal trust funds
a no one is seriously talking about that it would have less of an economic impact than erasing the publicly held debt
besides paying it off would mean selling the treasury bills the trust funds hold and putting that cash into other investments like the stock market or corporate bonds there is not yet a political consensus to do that
q is eliminating the publicly held debt a good idea
a economists agree that reducing that debt makes enormous sense but some worry that erasing it completely might cause problems because the government would no longer be selling treasury bills
the federal reserve often buys those bills back from investors when it wants to flush cash into the economy to spur it in addition because the government has never defaulted on them treasury bills are considered the safest investment on earth it is unclear what investors would turn to as a replacement
q how would politicians pay off the publicly held debt
a details are scarce but clinton says he will eliminate the publicly held debt by 2013 by buying it down with surpluses house republicans say they are working on a plan to do the same thing by at least 2015
the closest the united states has come to eliminating the publicly held debt was in 1835 under president andrew jackson when it dipped to $37513
q how quickly can the debt be eliminated
a it depends on assumptions about future federal spending how politicians decide to use future budget surpluses and how willing holders of treasury bills are to sell them back to the government but the nonpartisan congressional budget office said last week that the earliest possible date is 2009
q is that likely to occur
a no for that to happen politicians have to agree to cut federal spending for the next two years and then limit its growth to the level of inflation for the seven years after that in addition they must agree to use every penny of projected surpluses through 2009 to reduce the debt all of that is unlikely to happen
q how realistic then is retiring the publicly held debt by 2015 a somewhat more so but still questionable
both parties are reluctant to use social security surpluses for anything but debt reduction the pension program's surpluses are projected to total $23 trillion through 2010 with more accumulating after that there could be just enough social security surpluses between now and 2015 to erase the publicly held debt
but with unforeseen expenditures always looming there are no guarantees that social security surpluses will be left intact for debt reduction besides as baby boomers begin retiring social security surpluses could dwindle to nothing by right around 2015 - meaning that debt could start building up immediately
q what about using the rest of the budget surplus
a cbo expects the budget's non-social security surpluses to total as much as $19 trillion through 2010 both parties are eyeing that money however for tax cuts and higher spending and it is unlikely much of it will be left for debt reduction

fox news sunday - topic new hampshire guest gop presidential contender george w bush
while whitman administration officials hope their latest attempts to reduce chronically long waiting times at centralized car inspection centers begin to bear fruit on monday lawmakers will drive for more change to a system that has outraged motorists
senate president donald difrancesco who is eyeing a run for governor next year will testify before two committees to pitch his bill calling for the suspension of enhanced emissions inspections at all state operated centers the state revamped the inspection process last month in an attempt to meet clean air goals
the senate president's appearance before the upper house's transportation and budget committees on monday will set up a full senate vote on his bill a week later it also keeps alive an embarrassing story gov christie whitman wishes would just go away
that isn't going to happen said assemblyman neil cohen d-union a longtime critic of the governor's auto emission policies it reminds me of the third godfather movie where al pacino kept saying every time i try to get out of it they just keep dragging me in
the 10-year-old auto inspection controversy hit full throttle when whitman was forced to concede there were memos filled with early warnings foretelling many of the woes the system eventually faced the governor said she and transportation commissioner james weinstein knew nothing of the memos until a newspaper requested them
the governor has ordered attorney general john farmer to form a panel to probe why the warnings weren't heeded difrancesco and the state commission of investigation also plan to look into the circumstances surrounding the whitman administration's decision to grant a seven-year $400 million contract for parsons infrastructure and technology to set up and operate the centralized inspection stations the firm which hired politically connected lobbyists and made campaign donations to republican committees was the only bidder for the job in 1998
whitman last week suspended beginning monday the tougher auto emissions test and a computer system designed to monitor the process at the 15 centralized stations with the longest waiting times the new system will remain in effect at 17 other centralized inspection stations operated by parsons and at private garages
the governor also said the state will spend up to $12 million to cut the average $75 price tag for inspections at private garages by $25 inspections are free at the centralized stations
difrancesco however believes these steps don't go far enough his bill reworked on friday would suspend the tougher emissions test at all centralized stations motorists going to these stations would have their cars go through the old emissions test which does not look for asthma-causing smog compounds these motorists however would have to get another inspection after one year the inspection process is now once every two years
difrancesco's bill would allow motorists to get the tougher emissions test at private garages but he wants the state to reimburse the private garages by $50 a car
i believe this is in the best interests of new jersey motorists and in the best interests of our state as it seeks to make a good faith effort to meet the environmental goals and mandates that precipitated the change in inspections difrancesco said
democrats however are calling for more change cohen said whitman's plans for private garages fall short hurting many who made big investments in the tougher emissions equipment
every time the governor says she's making it better she's making it worse said cohen let's see the old test that people can more easily pass is free and the tougher test at the private garages is still $35 to $40 even after the rebates who is going to go to the private facilities she's created a financial nightmare for them
sen shirley turner d-mercer meanwhile objects to whitman's use of state money to subsidize the private garages to keep the prices lower
we shouldn't let the whitman administration bill taxpayers for another penny to solve the problems caused by parsons turner said
weinstein said the changes are being made to buy time for parsons to fix balky computer programs and streamline the inspection process the changes are expected to be in effect until june 30
he appeared out of the blue back in october clad only in a dirty white robe as he walked barefoot along the two-lane highway into this struggling former coal town
folks pointed at first as the man with the shoulder-length hair and scruffy beard preached to whoever would listen before long though many in this largely roman catholic community were embracing him as a holy man
he was in the car with me and a man came up and started banging on the window said the rev gerard f angelo pastor of the shrine of the sacred heart of jesus he said thank you so much for what you're doing i haven't been to church in 25 years and now i'm going again his effect on people is amazing
with hundreds of people gathering in fire halls gymnasiums and open fields to listen to the stranger his presence has some worried that the community has opened its hearts and homes too readily to someone they know little about
but his supporters fervent in their devotion say they know all they need to know the soft-spoken nomad is a messenger of god
i would walk through fire for him said connie muir a roman catholic who took him in to live with her family when it became too cold to sleep outside he's blessed by the holy spirit people's hearts are really changed after they've heard him
though he has preached for up to six hours at a stretch he is a man of few words when it comes to himself
in interviews he would not divulge his birthplace or background saying it would detract from his message the robe and messianic appearance he says bring attention to his ministry and make him more approachable
when anyone asks his name he replies what's your name he says it is part of a hebrew tradition to not reveal one's name to a person until you become their friend and it is what the locals now call him
police checked his background and found nothing of concern he was arrested in greenfield ohio in august after he refused to stop preaching to a crowd that became unruly when police tried to break up the gathering
he was identified in a police affidavit as carl j joseph 39
the disorderly conduct charge was dismissed and hazleton police said they have yet to receive any complaints about joseph
he says his nine-year trek has brought him to 47 states and 13 countries but never has he remained in one place for so long before
people here have been wonderful there's such a great need for spirituality today he said people feel desolate because they have gotten away from god and his church
hazleton - population 23000 - and other towns in the region have gone through troubled times since the coal industry went bust decades ago boarded-up storefronts line the eastern pennsylvania city's main thoroughfare and the unemployment rate for luzerne county hovers around 6 percent
lots of people around here are hurting and this guy is the only sign of hope some of them have seen in a long time said resident robert clark it worries me because people are putting all this stock in a guy who to me seems like he's got a screw loose
joseph has spoken to as many as 2000 people at one gathering in hazleton and it is not uncommon to see several dozen people standing in a field at 2 am listening to him preach
sam lesante host of a local cable program has had him on his show four times - once for a three-hour call-in special
for three solid hours the phones were continuously lit up - they just rang and rang and rang lesante said
his burgeoning popularity as well as the nearly unrestricted access he has been given in local catholic schools and hospitals is causing some worry
carl has always been welcome here to pray with us said monsignor michael j delaney pastor of st gabriel's church in hazleton the unusual element of his ministry was a concern being it's unusual we also know we have to be both welcoming and cautious - but we wish him well in his efforts
several religious leaders declined to speak publicly saying they did not want to further heighten disagreements regarding joseph within the religious community
others say that preaching the gospel is nothing but a good thing pointing out that what's your name is not seeking financial gain he turns over all money and gifts he receives to local parishes except for sandals he received recently because he did not own a pair of shoes
as word spreads joseph is beginning to bring his ministry to neighboring towns like mahanoy city a community of 5000 about 20 miles southwest of hazleton he has been staying at the rectory of st joseph's church
during a recent two-hour session at the mahanoy city fire hall what's your name told a crowd of several hundred people not to abandon their faith though he identifies himself as roman catholic he says his message is for all christians
i encourage everyone to get into communication with god again he said as the crowd nodded in agreement i've experienced so many different places so many different people so many different cultures but i've never learned more than i have from prayer
he said he will remain in the area as long as there is a need for his words
he could be here a while or he could be gone tomorrow muir said i'd like to see him stay around for a long time
in a sprint to the 2000 presidential nominations george w bush and al gore will not be stopped so their challengers are trying to trip them up and turn the races into marathons
for republican john mccain and democrat bill bradley the longer the track the better the odds
that was a tough enough strategy even before primary election states began leapfrogging each other to pack the early calendar of contests making it likely the nominations will be settled before the end of march
it is more difficult now
so mccain must start beating bush and bradley's talk of long-term campaign schedules as a signal he intends to keep contesting gore will ring hollow unless he too starts winning
mccain has the edge over the texas governor in polls of likely voters in tuesday's new hampshire presidential primary but by margins too close to make either the clear favorite one survey put bush barely ahead and thus statistically even
in the democratic surveys vice president gore has regained a lead polls published during the final weekend of campaigning for the primary showed gore with a widening margin over bradley
the surveys were conducted in part after the iowa caucuses where gore trounced the former new jersey senator nearly two-to-one in the year's first contest
bush won the crowded republican race with 41 percent of the vote steve forbes ran second and claimed the mantle of conservative alternative to bush and mccain the arizona senator
but forbes complained he did not get his fair share of debate time when all five republicans met wednesday night citing what he said was an unwarranted assumption that bush and mccain are the real contenders
measured by the new hampshire and national polls they are
bradley is turning tougher against gore showing the elbows of an old pro basketball player in an aggressive confrontational style in their final debate before the primary
bradley accused the vice president of lying about his proposals and called him a divisive dishonest campaigner he said all gore does is attack attack attack gore said bradley had turned negative
with that tone the five weeks between the new hampshire primary and the mega-tuesday primaries march 7 may be testy ones among democrats
there is no such gap in the republican calendar mccain skipped the iowa campaign to put time and resources into new hampshire upping the stakes although he has said he could get by with a narrow loss
he does not say that about their next test feb 19 in south carolina where bush is well ahead in the voter surveys a victory there is essential to the mccain challenge
then republicans vote feb 22 in arizona while mccain leads in his home state where losing would be devastating the polls rate that race close there are gop primaries in michigan the same day in virginia a week later and bush is strong in both states
there also is the matter of money mccain says he has what he needs to campaign into the big-state arenas in march but he will have to be a winner soon to keep raising money bush can afford a setback or two he has the biggest treasury in presidential campaign history an estimated $63 million raised so far
while forbes lags far behind those two in the new hampshire polls and nationally he insists he can emerge as the final challenger to bush he can afford it so long as he is willing to keep spending his personal fortune
in the democratic contest bradley says he has the resources for what he describes as the national campaign for the nomination the 11 primaries - including california and new york - on march 7
he also can take advantage of democratic rules that award nominating votes in proportion to shares of the primary vote so there is something to be gained even in losing but that can only be a holding action a candidate who keeps losing is obviously the loser
on march 14 bradley's test gets even tougher with six primaries in the south where he is weakest against gore of tennessee one of the states voting that day
the gore camp obviously wants to clinch as early as possible to avoid draining the candidate's treasury for what they assume will be a long spring and early summer of competing against bush who would have funds to spare
a bradley victory in new hampshire would squelch suggestions that he should get out of gore's way a gore victory would increase the pressure either way bradley says he is in for the march round
history shows challengers can be persistent
ronald reagan lost five primaries in a row to president gerald r ford in 1976 then revived his campaign finally accepting narrow defeat at the gop convention
bush kept going despite losing more than he won to reagan in 1980 yielding on may 26 when the outcome was inevitable and winding up as vice president
sen edward m kennedy d-mass took on president jimmy carter in 1980 won in 10 states and contested him to the convention conceding after gaining concessions on democratic policy
editor's note - walter r mears has reported on washington and national politics for the associated press for more than 35 years
with 800 people packed into a school gymnasium to hear him speak and a handful more braving subfreezing weather to shake his hand john mccain soaked up the scene and said this is the highlight of my political life
these are dreamy days for the men who want to be president but there is anxiety too for some the verdict of the notoriously fickle new hampshire voters will spell the end of their candidacies - or signal the beginning of the end
mccain's outcome is critical unlike national front-runner george w bush mccain cannot afford to lose tuesday's primary
if bush puts mccain away in new hampshire the arizona senator may look back at friday's jam-packed town hall meeting and realize sadly that it was indeed the highlight

russian forces advanced through snowy alleys and seized shell-shattered high-rises from rebels saturday in the chechen capital grozny but chechens said they were letting the russians move in so they could attack from behind
the russians' assault on grozny has concentrated for more than a week on minutka square which they advanced toward on saturday taking the square would give federal forces leverage to push the rebels out of the city center
meanwhile russian presidential aide sergei yastrzhembsky said 54 rebels surrendered in northeast grozny to forces led by pro-moscow chechen leader bislan gantamirov speaking on russia's ort television yastrzhembsky called the move a psychological breakthrough many of the rebels were wounded
but up to 3000 fighters are believed to remain in grozny and it was unclear whether the surrender would mean much in the monthlong battle for the city though gantamirov claimed friday he had persuaded some rebel commanders to give up arms pro-moscow chechens are deeply distrusted in the breakaway republic and gantamirov's previous claims have often proven false
russian troops have advanced on minutka square along side streets and were battling chechen fighters some 500 yards from the square said senior chechen rebel commander mumadi saidayev russian commanders had earlier claimed to be closer to the square but this was apparently the first time the rebels admitted the russians had made it so close
a top russian commander col gen valery manilov said the russians have seized several high-rise buildings in the leninsky and oktyabrsky districts to the north and south of minutka from rebel snipers who had hindered the russians' advance
but saidayev the chechen commander said the russians were being allowed to advance so they could be trapped and attacked by chechen fighters from the rear the interfax news agency reported that tactic inflicted severe losses on russian troops during the last chechnya war from 1994 to 1996
a chechen fighter who slipped through a supposed russian blockade and left grozny saturday said rebels have pulled back from some positions in outlying neighborhoods to avoid scattering their forces but were preparing strong defenses closer to the center of the city
the fighter who asked to be identified only by his first name bislan said rebel forces were positioned behind russian troops ready to stage surprise attacks despite the russians' claims of progress federal troops control only a few blocks in several districts of grozny bislan said
artillery and tank fire rained on grozny from all sides saturday the russian military command said warplanes and helicopter gunships also bombarded mountainous rebel outposts in southern chechnya
moscow sent troops into chechnya in september after an invasion by chechen-based militants into the neighboring russian republic of dagestan in august deadly apartment bombings in several russian cities also were blamed on chechens
a former accountant and key figure in the christian democrats' financial scandal has given the party's hesse state branch a 1000-plus page report on secret party money state christian democratic leaders said saturday
hesse has become a focus in the scandal over a network of financial schemes run by the christian democrats the conservative german party that led the government from the early 1980s until 1998 the hesse branch of the party said it would likely take a week to go through the report and after that it would be made public
horst weyrauch the accountant who prepared the report is the first witness who will be called in parliament's investigation of whether decisions by former chancellor helmut kohl's government were bought kohl has admitted taking up to $1 million in off-the-books donations for the party
according to a report in focus newsmagazine saturday weyrauch had threatened the party leadership telling it not to force him to reveal information about secret party funds party officials decided last week to threaten legal action against weyrauch after his remarks which focus said included an ominous statement when you want to know the truth then the republic totters
meanwhile new reports indicated the secret party funds extended even farther overseas than previously suspected
according to der spiegel newsmagazine weyrauch and the longtime state party accountant in hesse prince casimir sayn-wittgenstein worked with people in paraguay to design a system to create fake estates the system was to be used to funnel money to the party
as a result of the scandal spiegel reported the christian democrats may have to pay $205 million back to the federal government
kohl has refused to name the donors who gave the party the $1 million german president johannes rau indirectly called on kohl to reveal the names telling bild newspaper saturday that he saw no way to agree with an idea of honor that stands over law and the state
rau though has his own scandal to worry about some opposition politicians are now openly demanding that he resign for accepting free flights from a bank that had close ties to a state government while he was the state's governor
in a report saturday in focus deputy christian democratic chairman christian wulff called on rau to step down an indirect call for rau's resignation also came from conservative opposition leader michael glos of the christian social union in bavaria
on the sidelines of the christian democrats' troubles allegations of a plane scandal have been growing in recent months against the ruling social democrats in the state of north rhine-westphalia
earlier this week another social democrat longtime north rhine-westphalia finance minister heinz schleusser resigned after admitting a female companion went along on two of 49 free plane trips he had taken
rau's lawyer this week released a list of 44 flights rau made while governor paid for by the westdeutschen landesbank a state investigation is probing whether rau took the flights for private purposes
mention the name peter falk and columbo immediately springs to mind that's only natural since the los angeles cop mystery has been in primetime tv longer than any other drama
the 30-year association with the shambling trenchcoat-wearing detective has often obscured falk's other achievements case in point a storm in winter which appears on the showtime channel sunday feb 6 at 8 pm est
falk plays an embittered operator of a jewish deli in a small town in new york state through a mixup he is entrusted with the care of a 9-year-old harlem boy an impressive aaron meeks who has been granted a summer vacation out of the city they clash immediately exposing their own bigotry the heartwarming ending is inevitable but no less endearing
a storm in winter bears an impressive pedigree it is based on a script by the late rod serling the twilight zone the director is robert wise academy award winner for the sound of music and west side story now 85 it's his first movie direction in a decade
peter falk lives in a spacious house along beverly hills' movie star row also known as north roxbury drive lucille ball and desi arnaz lived there along with jimmy stewart his lovely old house has been demolished and a huge replacement is under construction rosemary clooney and diane keaton are among the current residents
falk can be found in the converted garage where he schmoozes on the phone with pals or in the built-on skylighted studio where he creates his charcoal drawings a few of them bold-stroked female nudes stand on an easel
i started drawing when i was doing the neil simon play the prisoner of second avenue in new york back in 1972 or 1973 he explained on 57th street i walked past a building that was the art students league for some unknown reason i went in there i opened a door and there she was
way down on the left shoulders back a light from above naked was a model the female body is awesome believe me i signed up right away a hearty laugh
despite two academy award nominations murder inc 1960 pocketful of miracles 1961 and a tony the prisoner of second avenue 1972 columbo three emmys remains falk's trademark
the first columbo appeared in 1967 it became a series in 1971 alternating with mcmillan and wife and mccloud columbo was by far the most popular of the trio but falk resisted offers to turn it into a weekly show he considered the job too heavy a load for one actor and he didn't want to be typecast in one role
after a four-year absence columbo returned as part of the abc mystery theater and it has continued making a few appearances every season a new episode has been filmed for the spring schedule and two more have been contracted
it's been a blockbuster around the world he marveled it gets a 40 share in france to this day they have a guy in france who does my voice beautifully the guy who does it in iran is the highest-paid actor in iran
and has he been able to avoid the stigma of typecasting his reply
the first thing i think of is a working guy out there hearing an actor complain that he's been typecast to him the actor must sound crazy that doesn't mean that i don't feel that i'd probably be a better actor if i had spent more time doing other things
despite the continued showings around the world falk receives no residual payments the reason he sold out his rights for a lump sum that's why he can afford to live on roxbury drive
besides liking the script falk said he accepted a storm in summer because of the chance to be directed by robert wise i like his philosophy of directing the actor remarked he seems to work by the theory that less is better
the admiration is mutual
showtime sent me the script and i liked it very much said the director from his home north of malibu and i've always wanted to work with peter falk
wise has long been an elder statesman of hollywood having served as president of the academy and the directors guild his last movie was in 1989 - rooftops a hard-edged urban drama with music that resembled his classic west side story he shared the directorial credit with jerome robbins
why hasn't he worked more
i don't know he replied maybe people thought i was getting along in years and didn't have it anymore
with a storm in summer falk declared wise proves that he still has it
volunteer firefighters responding to an alarm in this rural community arrived to find their own firehouse burning
the first firefighter on the scene friday was able to save two trucks but the firehouse itself burned down in 30 minutes
i saw flames about six feet above the roof when i rounded the corner said lt gerald kelley of the allentown volunteer fire department the chumuckla firehouse is a substation of his department
the fire remained under investigation but kelley said he suspected it was caused by a propane heater installed three days earlier to keep water from freezing
israeli prime minister ehud barak and palestinian leader yasser arafat will meet next week amid fading hopes for concluding the outline of a peace agreement by the deadline they set feb 13
if they don't meet it they'll reach some understanding about how to deal with that problem a senior us official said saturday after a 30-minute meeting between arafat and president clinton
the statement was the frankest admission yet that american mediators are likely to fall short of their target for a basic understanding about the future of jerusalem whether there will be a palestinian state and other knotty issues at the core of the arab-israeli dispute
the barak-arafat meeting will be held thursday or friday at erez a border crossing between israel and palestinian-held gaza and will focus on the major unresolved issues said the official who briefed reporters on condition of anonymity
he described the pursuit of the deadline as a formidable challenge it's very difficult to get there the official said
there were no american claims of progress after clinton saw arafat in the steigenberger hotel belvedere in this swiss ski resort they were among scores of world leaders attending an international economic forum
it was their second meeting in nine days neither was progress claimed after the last one at the white house in washington
the state department announced thursday that senior us mediator dennis ross would go to the middle east to help in the search for a settlement ross is due in israel on wednesday
lower-ranking israeli and palestinian negotiators are to hold intensive talks early this week at israel's read sea resort eilat
clinton has appealed to the two sides to seek less than 100 percent of their demands he said a settlement requires as much
secretary of state madeleine albright in her own flurry of diplomacy in davos was to see king abdullah of jordan saturday night arafat and egyptian foreign minister amr moussa on sunday
she then travels to moscow where she has separate meetings scheduled monday with foreign ministers david levy of israel and prince saud of saudi arabia they will be in moscow for a multilateral conference to promote understanding between the jewish state and its arab neighbors
clinton albright and ross all are prepared to commit themselves to working on a day-by-day basis to try to reach an israeli-palestinian settlement the us official said saturday
palestinian officials have raised the possibility of shifting negotiations to washington if talks in the region do not produce an accord
on friday the palestinians accused barak of not being serious about reaching the feb 13 deadline
nabil shaath the palestinian planning minister said his negotiating team proposed that the talks be conducted in washington under clinton's close supervision but israel rejected the idea
also salim zanoun chairman of the palestine liberation organization's decision-making central council said the council will meet wednesday in gaza city to set the date for the declaration of an independent palestinian state
it appeared highly unlikely however that the palestinians would issue a unilateral declaration of independence and risk angering the americans before the september deadline for a peace treaty with israel

no one disputes the math
officer sean carroll squeezed off 16 rounds so did edward mcmellon kenneth boss added five shots and richard murphy four for a total of 41
nineteen of the bullets tore through the body of amadou diallo in a matter of seconds turning the 5-by-8-foot vestibule of his bronx apartment building into a dingy death trap
it might have ended there if diallo was an armed criminal as the police apparently feared instead he was a street vendor carrying only a pager and wallet
nearly a year later - with a backdrop mixing racial politics and a mother's well-publicized grief - a jury must decide whether the shooting of the west african immigrant by the four white officers was murder
jury selection for the officers' trial is set to begin monday the trial will be in albany ny because an appeals court took the unusual step of moving the case from the bronx it agreed with defense attorneys that a torrent of pretrial publicity and protests would make it impossible to find impartial jurors in new york city
last week justice joseph teresi ruled the trial could be televised - in part to ensure access to city residents - but that is unlikely to still anger over the change of venue
civil rights activists including the rev al sharpton have vowed to lead their followers to albany to rally behind the diallo family they also urged federal authorities to monitor a case they say symbolizes widespread police brutality against minorities
amadou's blood will feed the battle for justice for everyone his mother kadiatou diallo said last year after the officers were indicted on charges of second-degree murder
carroll 36 mcmellon 27 boss 28 and murphy 27 pleaded innocent but prosecutors allege they demonstrated a depraved indifference to human life by unleashing the barrage on a defenseless man
the defendants' decision not to testify before a grand jury left no option except murder charges carrying a maximum sentence of life in prison said bronx district attorney robert johnson
without their explanation what we have is four people driving up to a location pulling out their guns and killing an individual johnson said
defense attorneys and the city's powerful police union the patrolmen's benevolent association maintain the officers made a tragic mistake part of a plainclothes unit assigned to combat street crime they thought diallo 22 was reaching for a gun while lurking around the apartment building
the officers have signaled they will take the witness stand in their own defense
the case is about whether you give police officers the benefit of the doubt said mcmellon's attorney stephen worth you either somehow believe a bunch of cops thought what the hell we'll shoot this guy for no good reason' or you realize that they thought they were in danger of being shot at and took proper action
today many new yorkers know diallo's name and about the 41 bullets
but before their worlds collided at about 1240 am on feb 4 1999 the victim and the shooters navigated the city in relative anonymity
diallo's father guinean entrepreneur saikou amad diallo once hawked candy and cigarettes in senegal he later launched a career as a jewel trader he married kadiatou his second wife when she was only 14 they divorced in 1990
the eldest of the couple's four children diallo studied computers before leaving africa for new york in 1996 he peddled videotapes on the streets of manhattan and lived in a two-story red-brick building in a rough section of the bronx
the officers clean-cut looking products of more peaceful neighborhoods signed on with the nation's largest police department in time to ride a dramatic downturn in crime murders alone plummeted to 629 in 1998 from 2245 in 1990
the defendants were part of the roving street crime unit credited with driving down the numbers of shootings by arresting armed suspects the unit made nearly 4000 arrests and seized about 1000 guns in 1998 alone
but even before diallo killing complaints arose that street crime used unlawful stop-and-frisk tactics against young men of color - especially in the bronx a borough with a history of tension between minorities and police police officials have since come under fire for expanding the unit with inexperienced officers of the four defendants only carroll had been in the unit for more than a year
on the night of the shooting the officers were patrolling diallo's neighborhood in a ford taurus looking for violent suspects each was armed with a 16-shot semiautomatic pistol and wore a bulletproof vest three had been involved in previous shootings one fatal all were deemed justified
what happened in front of 1157 wheeler avenue in a span of less than a minute - and what was going through the defendants' minds - will be the focus of the trial expected to last more than a month
according to the defense the officers stopped their car after spotting diallo wearing a knit yankees cap duck into the shadows around his building with carroll and mcmellon approaching first and murphy and boss following he ignored an order to freeze then made a sudden move - drawing gunfire
the defense says that as the bullets flew carroll was so sure diallo was armed he yelled gun mcmellon fell backward as he and carroll retreated that further created an impression a gun battle was under way
we're talking about split-second decisions said steven brounstein the attorney for boss what if this had gone the other way what if boss held his fire while his partner was being shot it would have been a police funeral
the bronx district attorney's office has largely kept quiet about its case
but a civilian witness has said he heard two or three shots a two-second pause then another burst of fire the pause would support arguments that the officers had a chance to realize their mistake and hold fire yet didn't
the prosecution also is expected to use medical evidence to contend that diallo was dropped by the first bullets instantly ending any threat and meaning the officers continued shooting even though diallo was on the ground the defense contends the victim remained upright making him a perceived threat deserving of deadly force
an autopsy found diallo was hit 11 times in the legs five bullets went into the left side of body he was also hit once in the back right arm and in the front of his chest the bullets perforated his aorta spinal cord lungs liver spleen kidneys and intestines
afterward with diallo dead in the vestibule boss' voice could be heard over police radios calling for an ambulance
five days later kadiatou diallo arrived from guinea and went straight to the bronx television crews filmed a woman in traditional west african robes crying out her son's name as she arrived the scene of his death
in the weeks that followed a team of lawyers for diallo's estate began preparing a wrongful death lawsuit sure to seek millions of dollars in damages diallo was buried under a fig tree in an african village founded by his great-grandfather and more than 1200 people - including actress susan sarandon former mayor david dinkins and rep charles rangel - were arrested for civil disobedience during demonstrations at police headquarters
a more muted protest went on at 1157 wheeler mourners there covered the bullet-scarred vestibule with graffiti some still visible today
amadou one says your life was not in vain
in the baseball-crazed giuliani administration the news earlier this month that deputy mayor randy levine was leaving to become president of the new york yankees surprised almost no one
after all levine a close friend and valued adviser to the mayor had worked in the past as an attorney for yankee owner george steinbrenner as chief labor negotiator for major league baseball owners and served as a conduit between the yankees the mets and the giuliani administration while the team sought a new city-funded stadium
indeed for more than a decade levine 44 has shuttled back and forth between two masters mayor rudolph giuliani and major league baseball
by most accounts his record of success is stellar including landmark labor agreements in both baseball and the city but levine also tiptoed into some gray areas ethically playing a role in deals that turned over at least $140 million in city funds to construction projects involving steinbrenner and mets owner fred wilpon
levine who had no prior experience in economic development before he was appointed deputy mayor for economic development planning and administration by giuliani two-and-a-half years ago first met giuliani in the mid-1980s when both worked for the us justice department during the reagan administration
after he left justice in 1988 levine went to work for the manhattan law firm that helped end steinbrenner's nearly three-year ban from baseball for his ties to a gambler steinbrenner and levine who share an interest in conservative politics and the yankees eventually became friends and levine's back-and-forth between city hall and baseball began
the next year he signed on with giuliani's failed mayoral bid and came back for the 1993 race which giuliani won levine was then appointed giuliani's labor commissioner and his tasks included being the administration's point person for discussions on new stadiums for the yankees and mets
he left the city administration again in 1995 to be baseball's labor negotiator with the strong backing of both steinbrenner and wilpon then after leading owners and players to an agreement he rejoined giuliani in 1997 as deputy mayor
when levine resigned two weeks ago to become the yankees president the mayor said he planned to bring him back yet again this time as a top adviser for a planned giuliani campaign for us senate he also will work for the prominent akin gump strauss hauer and feld law firm as a senior counsel on labor and employment practices
as deputy mayor levine is credited with helping the giuliani administration reach a tentative accord to build a new headquarters for the new york stock exchange in lower manhattan and in aiding in the transformation of times square from seedy enclave for prostitutes to home of some of the world's top media companies
but levine built like a designated hitter and known around city hall for his booming laugh was primarily valued by giuliani for his political skills unquestioned loyalty and his record as a top rank negotiator
for instance as the city's chief labor negotiator in 1994 and 1995 levine helped save the city hundreds of millions of dollars in contracts with city workers and teachers after persuading unions to provide givebacks and requiring that future pay raises be based on productivity gains
randy said giuliani during an interview is exceptionally talented he was involved in every decision i made
steinbrenner and wilpon - who had both known levine before they hired him to help negotiate a landmark labor contract on behalf of owners in 1995 that some have credited with saving baseball - had similarly high praise
i admire his loyalty his friendship his ability to negotiate he's a man of his word people respect him steinbrenner said through a spokesman
he subjugates his ego and is very direct and honest said wilpon when he tells you something you can go to the bank with it
when levine returned to the giuliani administration as deputy mayor he signed an agreement with the city's conflict of interest board to recuse himself from dealings with professional baseball
this would avoid any conflict since he was being paid $1000-a month as a consultant to major league owners had an option to return to the sport and finally was being paid between $500000 and $1 million by owners as part of a severance package
the city conflict of interest agreement expired after one year when levine severed formal ties to baseball under city law he'll be prohibited from contacting senior giuliani administration officials in connection with his new baseball job for one year but he'll be allowed to take part in the mayor's campaign
federal law is much tougher people leaving high federal posts can be prohibited from ever dealing with the agencies where they worked
during a recent interview levine - who like the mayor is a lifelong yankee fan born in brooklyn and raised on long island - said he honored the conflict-of-interest agreement even after he was no longer bound by it
that all ran out years ago but just on my own i still continued to maintain a recusal from baseball when i didn't have to he said
the city recusal letter prohibited levine from participating in discussions and attending meetings with city or major league baseball officials and states mr levine's complete recusal requires that he not participate in any matters which involve major league baseball or its dealings with the city or be otherwise involved as a city official in such dealings
despite that stipulation levine has acknowledged discussing with steinbrenner a proposal in which the city eventually agreed to spend $76 million to build a minor league stadium complex for the yankees on staten island the centerpiece of an extensive overhaul of the island's waterfront
in an interview levine refused to discuss his conversation with steinbrenner but in a 1998 interview with the daily news levine acknowledged that during a breakfast he told steinbrenner that staten island borough president guy molinari wanted to discuss the stadium plan
the conflict of interest board whose members are appointed by the mayor took no action against levine a spokesman said the board has a policy of not commenting on its investigations
giuliani and other city officials said however that levine had nothing to do with subsequent negotiations or planning for the stadium
administration officials do acknowledge however that levine helped arrange a business deal that benefitted wilpon
in 1997 wilpon called levine shortly after levine was named deputy mayor seeking city financial help to build a 44-story skyscraper that would serve as the new headquarters for bear stearns
wilpon said he called levine at city hall to seek incentives and to find out who to talk to about the project
eventually the city promised the company $75 million in tax breaks and $15 billion in low interest tax exempt bonds to finance construction additionally wilpon stands to reap millions as the project's developer
and while levine maintains that the deal was necessary to keep bear stearns from moving out of the city bear stearns said the company had never considered doing so
such tax breaks for profitable businesses building new offices have become common in recent years with the threat of moving one chip always on the table
giuliani said that although levine had a significant role in the bear stearns project his involvement did not violate levine's conflict agreement because it was not strictly baseball-related
that's his job said giuliani to promote economic development that's what a deputy mayor for economic development does bring business to the city
president clinton urged the nation saturday to remain on the course his administration has set policies that he said led america from deep budget deficits to unimagined economic strength
in his weekly radio address clinton underscored themes from thursday night's 89-minute state of the union message and said the united states has arrived at a pivotal moment where it is possible to shape the future of our dreams for our children
clinton who has one year left of his second four-year term said he will meet with republican and democratic house and senate leaders tuesday at the white house to discuss how we can move forward together
now is not the time to change course clinton said if we will stay this course we can pay the country's debt off for the first time since 1835
republicans portraying the president as a wasteful big spender said they will reject his new budget write their own and carve an attention-getting tax cut out of the budget surpluses economists now project for the next decade and more the congressional budget office has set the figure at $19 trillion by 2010
president clinton has already figured out how to spend most of that money for new government spending programs and that's before the ink's even dry on his big-spending state of the union speech rep jim nussle r-iowa said in the weekly republican response to the president's radio talk
nussle and rep jc watts r-okla chairman of the house republican conference said the gop's first tax target is to scrap the so-called marriage penalty the provision of the internal revenue service code by which couples earning two incomes fall into higher tax brackets than couples in which one person is the main breadwinner
i urge clinton to take control of the extreme left of his party and push for an end to penalizing married couples simply for being married watts said
clinton proposes to reduce the marriage penalty for two-earner couples by increasing their standard income tax deduction by more than $2000 with smaller increases in the deductions that can be claimed by single-earner married couples and by single filers the white house said these changes would benefit 42 million families at a cost of $45 billion over 10 years
watts said that for republicans ending the marriage penalty altogether is just the beginning
we cannot allow the democrats' risky budget-busting tax scheme to raid the social security trust fund and hike inflation turning back the clock on all we have accomplished watts said in a statement
clinton who taped the radio speech before leaving for a world-trade meeting in davos switzerland said he hopes congressional leaders will come to the white house meeting ready for serious talks on his ambitious state of the union proposals which include a plan to pay off the $36 trillion national debt over the next 13 years
he credited his administration's fiscal discipline for moving the country away from record budget deficits and high unemployment to record budget surpluses and unimagined economic strength
the president said he wants to reserve a third of the projected federal surplus for debt reduction he said a lower debt would free up interest payments that he said should be used to preserve social security
that will keep it strong and sound for 50 years the president said
jerzy einhorn only a young man when he was forced into a concentration camp in western poland survived the holocaust that 6 million other jews did not
five decades later he says neo-nazism is gaining ground - making it all the more urgent that the world does not forget the consequences of hate people need to remember for their own sake and their children's he says but memories alone are not enough
i think that we who are saved cannot believe that just some 55 years after that democracies would be accepting nazis at all says einhorn 75 a professor at stockholm's karolinska institute
his hopes echo those of many world leaders at an international forum on the holocaust where more than 40 countries pledged friday to uphold the terrible truth of the holocaust against those who deny it
that declaration came even as far-right populist joerg haider - who once praised adolf hitler's orderly employment policy and lauded waffen ss veterans as decent people of good character - was in talks on forming a coalition that would control austria's parliament and it was issued only hours before hundreds of neo-nazis demonstrated in berlin at the construction site of a planned memorial to holocaust victims
the holocaust was unprecedented but now the precedent is there israeli historian yehuda bauer said at the conference it depends on all of us especially on you the politicians of this world to turn this precedent into a warning
einhorn was among survivors activists and educators at the conference who called for more research better classroom programs and wider use of the internet to show future generations what can happen if racism xenophobia and anti-semitism are tolerated
survivors' testimony must be better recorded and still-secret documents released before living witnesses are gone participants said
and even with all the research that has been done questions about the holocaust remain delegates said
historians tell us how the tragedy happened but why did it happen asked nobel laureate elie wiesel
the three-day conference was organized by the swedish government as part of its campaign to raise awareness among young people about the genocide of 6 million jews and more than 2 million others including gypsies and homosexuals
sending teachers to israel to study the holocaust posting lists and survivor accounts on the internet and building more memorials were some of the programs suggested
we must support each other in the teaching of humanity and civil courage so that normal people shall never again in the name of some criminal ideology turn normal places into grim factories of execution german chancellor gerhard schroeder said
survivors' testimony is especially important speakers said since only their stories can prevent future generations from denying the genocide occurred
we stand on the threshold of the era when resources of education will be the only thing to relay the horrors of what happened and its significance said hubert locke of the university of washington
the delegates also pointed to recent ethnic conflicts that led to mass killings and called for more preventive diplomacy and an early warning system to alert leaders to racial problems that could escalate
one of the horrible lessons of the holocaust is that it can happen again said ralph grunewald of the american jewish committee it happened in rwanda it happened in east timor and kosovo
secretary of state madeleine albright will make a brief visit to croatia on wednesday to endorse democratic trends in that balkan country
albright will meet the new prime minister ivica racan members of his cabinet and parliament and other political figures
the secretary will also take the occasion to congratulate all croatians including the representatives of civil society who have contributed to the democratic process state department spokesman james p rubin said in a statement saturday
albright was sharply critical of the late president franjo tudjman's policies in croatia a former republic of yugoslavia
the former cabinet dominated by tudjman's croatian democratic union transferred power thursday to the coalition government of social democrats and social liberals which defeated the cdu in jan 3 parliamentary elections
albright will stop in zagreb for a few hours on her way home from moscow

clinton albright and ross all are prepared to commit themselves to working on a day-by-day basis to try to reach an israeli-palestinian settlement the us official said saturday
palestinian officials have raised the possibility of shifting negotiations to washington if talks in the region do not produce an accord
on friday the palestinians accused barak of not being serious about reaching the feb 13 deadline
nabil shaath the palestinian planning minister said his negotiating team proposed that the talks be conducted in washington under clinton's close supervision but israel rejected the idea
also salim zanoun chairman of the palestine liberation organization's decision-making central council said the council will meet wednesday in gaza city to set the date for the declaration of an independent palestinian state
it appeared highly unlikely however that the palestinians would issue a unilateral declaration of independence and risk angering the americans before the september deadline for a peace treaty with israel
nearly six months after he was detained in china on charges of smuggling state secrets a us-based researcher arrived back in america today
i really feel i'm home now said song yongyi who looked tired but was smiling broadly as he arrived at philadelphia international airport at about 145 pm
during the past 30 years i never cried but last night i cried all night
song a librarian at dickinson college in carlisle pa and an authority on china's cultural revolution was detained on aug 7 and later was charged under china's vague secrets law
his release came unexpectedly and removed an irritant from us-chinese relations as they slowly recover from nato's bombing of china's embassy in belgrade in may this past week the us and chinese militaries resumed a formal dialogue that beijing called off in anger over the bombing
sen arlen specter a republican from pennsylvania said he believed china was releasing song to curry favor with the us congress china would like congress to stop reviewing its low-tariff trading privileges annually and grant the rights permanently as part of a deal to join the world trade organization
chinese security officials on friday took song from the detention center where he had been held and sent him to a government office his wife helen yao said in a telephone interview from their us home
he called me and said he was free said yao who was arrested with song in august but released in november today is a very exciting day
song had planned to become a us citizen in september after returning from his research trip to china
us ambassador to china james prueher said he hoped song's release would be a harbinger of continued open academic research in china and of broader discussions with the chinese government on related issues prueher said in a statement he was delighted for song yongyi and his family
song 50 has written articles and a book in chinese about the 1966-76 cultural revolution when mao tse-tung unleashed a wave of radical violence to oust opponents in the communist party and ignite revolutionary zeal a million people died and millions more were persecuted song spent five years in prison accused of being a counterrevolutionary
song's specialty has been collecting documents from the cultural revolution period and making them accessible to other scholars
song was collecting old newspapers and other public documents from the period as he had done on past trips to china when he and his wife were detained on aug 7 on dec 24 he was charged with purchasing or illegally supplying intelligence for people outside the territory of china
as recently as tuesday the chinese foreign ministry accused song of harming china's national security by trying to smuggle 700 pounds of secret documents out of the country foreign ministry spokesman zhu bangzao said song had confessed zhu said song had been purchasing such materials since 1996 using funds from overseas institutions
song's detention shocked the american academic community the us government and members of congress lobbied china for his freedom more than 100 china scholars in the united states petitioned chinese president jiang zemin for his release saying song was engaged in normal academic work not espionage
song who is from shanghai attended college in china when schools reopened across the country after the cultural revolution ended he went to the united states in 1989 and earned master's degrees in chinese literature and library science and has worked at dickinson college since 1997
the state legislature and governor can head off annual toll increases on the new york state thruway by finding another way to fund needed improvements to the superhighway and the other transportation facilities it controls a thruway officials says
the thruway needs the toll increases - the first would be 18 percent beginning on june 1 - to help pay for $275 million in projects this year thruway authority executive director john platt said under a construction plan approved by the authority's board late last week new road and bridge projects would grow to nearly $1 billion in five years
the authority board approved a plan which could institute annual toll increases on the thruway over the next five years tied to an index of construction costs in 20 us cities published by the engineering news record
if the construction cost index goes up so will tolls pending annual reviews of the thruway's finances and needs by the thruway authority board if the construction cost index goes down the tolls will not increase hikes would be capped at 3 percent a year
had the system been in place since 1997 toll increases of 22 percent each year would have been in order the thruway authority said
tolls on the thruway last went up in 1988 by 31 percent
the thruway board's three members are all appointees of gov george pataki who derailed a proposed thruway toll increase in 1996 it is chaired by louis tomson formerly a top figure in pataki's executive chamber
state senate majority leader joseph bruno said thruway toll increases would be a hidden tax that might blunt recent economic gains
our concern is funding the capital program platt said we're using the toll adjustment as a hedge against increased construction costs if the senate majority wants to make money available for capital projects we'll be more than happy to discuss this alternative
bruno's office on friday sounded the alarm in albany about the impending toll increase the thruway authority's board meeting thursday in albany had voted to adopt the toll-increase system without prior public acknowledgment that it was working on such a plan
the toll increase was referred to as an indexed toll adjustment plan in a news release the authority said it distributed thursday
platt defended the manner in which the toll-hike plan was revealed
this is the starting point of a process he said friday night the board has not adopted this it authorized that we go forward with the public hearings
four hearings will be held on toll increase in april tentatively in buffalo syracuse albany and the new york city area the board would finalize the plan at some point between then and june 1 platt said
the thruway's per-mile charge for passenger cars would go from 31 cents to 32 cents with the anticipated toll increase on june 1 still one of the lowest charges in the northeast on toll highways thruway spokeswoman anya frost said
the state motor truck association reacted angrily to the toll-increase plan
with recent fuel-price increases amounting to 15 cents a mile for big rigs the industry is having a near impossible time trying to keep trucks moving association president bill joyce said how can the state of new york increase the tax burden on an industry so vital to the state economy
platt said the thruway is reclassifying trucks in a way that will help most haulers fifty-three-foot-long trailers pulled by semis would see toll reductions of nearly 16 percent under the reclassification according to platt the tandems where two trailers are coupled together would see their tolls increase by 2 percent he said
blaming foreign trade policies and rising costs officials of a knitting company that has been making clothes since the late 1800s say they are going out of business
the johnstown knitting mill co which traces it roots to 1893 and employs 229 people will close by late march company officials announced friday
johnstown knit as it is locally known is an independent-line knitwear manufacturer it also sells its clothing - everything from socks to t-shirts to long underwear
we knew it was going to close we knew for six or eight months one employee who didn't want his name published told the daily gazette of schenectady friday
work just got slower and slower throughout the whole mill he said
the business has been in the family of the current president thomas b easterly for five generations
the company attributes a majority of their loss to us foreign trade policies such as nafta which has encouraged many us companies to manufacture goods offshore this has made it next to impossible for most domestic manufacturers to compete in the marketplace company officials said in a press release
this announcement comes with great regret after being part of the community for such a long time the company has been fortunate to have many good and longtime employees to whom the company is very grateful  the statement said
easterly said friday night that company officials are deeply saddened by the decision and he declined further comment
you don't fill a loss like this johnstown mayor bill pollak told the gazette
pollak a lifelong resident who grew up near the west montgomery street main mill he said it reminded him of the early 1970s when another local industrial institution the knox gelatine co moved to new jersey
companies that you think will be in a place forever - bingo - they're gone
far-right populist joerg haider whose party rose to prominence in austria after stoking anti-foreigner sentiment last fall predicted saturday that a government featuring his party would impose a nearly complete ban on immigration
haider said the only foreigners who would be allowed to move to austria would be seasonal workers who would leave after several months
he made the announcement as the stream of foreign criticism continued over the possibility of his freedom party's inclusion in government his party now austria's second largest has been talking to the austrian people's party about forming a coalition that would control parliament
undeterred by the furor abroad negotiators from his party and the center-right people's party were planning to resume their talks aimed at setting up a joint cabinet next week
haider is known for once praising adolf hitler's orderly employment policy and for later lauding veterans of the waffen ss as decent people of good character he has been apologizing ever since
but his party made stunning gains in austria's oct 3 parliamentary elections drawing heavily on voters who fear that eu expansion and a liberal immigration policy will cost them their jobs
by saturday most european governments had criticized haider the european union has warned austria against setting up a government that includes haider's party and belgium is calling for common eu action if such a coalition materializes
among those joining the chorus of critics were french president jacques chirac german president johannes rau and german chancellor gerhard schroeder
austria must see to it not to isolate itself politically schroeder told the bild am sonntag newspaper
chirac was reportedly pressing the eu to take precise measures if haider's party joins the austrian government the measures were not specified
catherine colonna chirac's spokeswoman said the president called portuguese prime minister antonio guterres to tell him it is indispensable that austria's 14 european partners act quickly portugal currently holds the rotating eu presidency
haider reacting to chirac's moves said the french president had done everything wrong that can be done wrong
the president of the european parliament nicole fontaine said on french radio that the eu has sanction powers that would let it exclude member nations guterres meanwhile phoned austrian president thomas klestil to express his concern over the political developments
answering questions on austrian state radio haider said saturday that his party and the people's party are in full agreement on what austria's new immigration policy should look like he said it would be tantamount to a de facto zero immigration and that the country should focus on integrating the foreigners already in austria instead of letting in more
the only exception he said would be for seasonal tourism industry laborers who would be allowed in from abroad he added that such a policy cannot be challenged internationally and on a european scale
in the radio interview haider said he was taking the foreign criticism in stride
basically such criticism was to be expected from those who cannot put up with the fact that democracy means change and democracy means that the people can decide what they want he said
we want a europe of the citizens and not one of bureaucrats haider stressed reiterating his past criticisms of the european union
in a welcome distraction from the furor haider celebrated his 50th birthday saturday stunt fliers costumed musicians and a giant apple strudel were on hand as hundreds celebrated the popular leader's birthday near villach a mountain town high in the austrian alps
haider visibly enjoyed the accolades from fans and freedom party colleagues after skiing to several mountain huts he was cheered by about 300 people who lined up to greet him and give him presents
at one point he danced to alpine music well known in carinthia province where he is governor
pakistan rejected as unwarranted saturday an apparent warning from the united states that it could be branded a sponsor of terrorism
the foreign ministry said although the pakistani government may be sympathetic to a secessionist uprising in indian-ruled kashmir it is firmly opposed to terrorism and does not aid religious organizations involved in the insurgency
there is no warrant for any warning the ministry said in a statement
on thursday the united states warned pakistan that it could be listed as a sponsor of terrorism - making it ineligible for virtually all us aid - if it gave direct support to harkat-ul-mujahedeen a militant group that operates in kashmir and is headquartered in pakistan
the warning followed comments by us state department spokesman james p rubin earlier in the week that there has long been concern that agencies of the pakistani government provided general support to a number of groups operating in the territory disputed by india and pakistan
washington says there are links between last month's hijacking of an indian airlines plane and harkat-ul-mujahedeen which was placed on the state department's list of terrorist organizations in 1997 when it was called harkat-ul-ansar
on saturday pakistan's foreign ministry repeated its condemnation of the hijacking and vowed to punish the hijackers if they are arrested in pakistan the hijacking ended in afghanistan with 155 hostages freed in exchange for the indian government's release of three pro-kashmiri militants
the most prominent of the militants is maulana masood azhar a harkat-ul-mujahedeen member who had been in jail in india since 1994 without being charged
since his release he has toured pakistan making speeches condemning india and trying to recruit holy warriors to fight indian troops in the part of kashmir ruled by india
the former princely state tucked in the shadows of the himalayan mountains is divided between pakistan and india but both countries claim a united kashmir as their own the neighbors have fought two wars over kashmir and last summer engaged in a bitter border dispute
in pakistan there is legitimate sympathy with the kashmir people who are suffering indian military occupation and sustained repression which has been widely documented by human rights organizations said the pakistani statement
the legitimate kashmiri struggle cannot be described as terrorist activity it said however we believe in the peaceful negotiations process and official pakistani agencies do not provide any support to the religious organizations involved in the insurgency
according to the foreign ministry statement these organizations are bound by pakistani laws and infringement of the laws would entail required action
pakistan has been a close ally of the united states in the battle against terrorism the statement says offering as an example the extradition from pakistan of suspects involved in the world trade center bombing in new york and the attack on us embassies in africa
pakistan does not condone international tension the statement said we have demonstrated our opposition to terrorism
meanwhile saturday rockets fired from across the border in india slammed into the pakistani village of daholo wali killing two people and wounding three others said shahid mahmood deputy commissioner of the sialkot region
indian troops in the area have fired heavy mortars and waged regular gun battles across the border he said several other rockets have landed without exploding
the attack came just one day after two bombs shook karachi killing four people and wounding 32 others most of the dead and wounded in karachi were worshippers at a mosque which was heavily damaged by one of the bombs
most of new york's high school seniors have passed the state's required regents test in english despite fears that hundreds of thousands of them would miss graduating this spring because of new state diploma requirements
state education commissioner richard mills told a forum on education standards at union college in schenectady earlier this month that more than 90 percent of the seniors have already made the grade on the english regents test
on monday mills will release the scores of the seniors who took the test before january education department officials have refused to reveal the exact number but they have acknowledged that mills had made a good estimate at the forum
education officials previously had announced that three out of four students required to pass a regents english exam before graduation had done so at that time they could not say how many of those students were seniors
public school students will have to pass five regents exams - in english math american history global studies and a science - to receive a diploma starting in 2003 the requirements currently are being phased in with one subject added each academic year
this year's seniors are the first who must pass the state's english regents exam to graduate as part of a state board of regents-imposed program to raise to school standards students must also satisfactorily complete their regular course work in order to get a diploma
some state lawmakers have advocated legislation to delay the regents' graduation requirements while the process is studied more others have pushed alternative exams to the regents like so-called portfolios
mills rejected the alternative testing route this week upsetting one legislator
cookie-cutter standardized testing should not be the only way to tell that students are meeting the new higher standards said democratic assemblyman richard brodsky of westchester county
in new york city 87 percent of the seniors have passed the english regents test according to new york city board of education figures before january 28560 of new york city seniors had passed the test while 4553 hadn't spokeswoman margie feinburg said about half the ones who needed to take the test had failed it previously while the other half hadn't taken it yet she said
some students had a touch of bad luck when they missed the test due to last wednesday's heavy snowstorm across much of the state
a survey by the state education department of the state biggest urban and highest-need districts indicated very few students were affected according to state education department spokesman bill hirschen no specific figures were available
hirschen said a last chance at passing the english regents will be offered students in june if they are to graduate with their class

microsoft mogul bill gates brought leonardo da vinci's leicester codex to germany's capital saturday opening an exhibit that includes drawings by 20th century artist joseph beuys
beuys who began his studies in natural science was inspired by the discovery of a lost leonardo manuscript in spain in the 1970s
like leonardo four centuries earlier beuys broke through barriers of art and science gates said
the codex got its name in 1715 when it was acquired by thomas coke the earl of leicester gates bought it in 1994 for $308 million making it the only known leonardo notebook in private hands
it chronicles leonardo's experiments into geology paleontology human anatomy and other subjects the manuscript includes sketches that show the way water flows around obstacles and suggestions of types of machines that could be powered by falling water
his observations impress people more than ever around the world gates said this notebook speaks to us by stimulating our own forces of creativity
leaving las vegas star elisabeth shue is returning to harvard
she needs one more semester to get her degree in government the timing depends on one more movie role she wants to do her representative steven huvane said in saturday's new york daily news

a woman who lost her palimony case against jack klugman has failed in her bid for a new trial
barbara neugass sued the actor in 1997 claiming that klugman owed her at least $900000 following an 18-year relationship that ended in 1992 she claimed she gave up her career as a television extra to be with him
last month a jury ruled against her and superior court judge kurt lewin on friday rejected her request for the new trial
the jury found that the couple did not have an agreement requiring the 77-year-old to provide neugass 57 with financial support for the rest of her life
disgruntled westerners shipped thousands of shovels to northeast nevada to protest federal environmental policy and lend support to residents feuding with the us forest service over a washed-out road
about 200 makeshift floats and other vehicles were entered in a parade saturday to carry an estimated 10000 shovels down elko's main street to a rally at the county courthouse
it has taken on a life of its own said oq chris johnson a local businessman who helped organize the jarbidge shovel brigade parade it's bigger than the fourth of july
ranchers loggers miners and small business owners donated the shovels in a show of support for locals' efforts to rebuild the south canyon road along the jarbidge river in the humboldt-toiyabe national forest the forest service has fought their efforts saying the road work and erosion would harm the river's population of bull trout an endangered species
most of the shovels were delivered in a caravan from montana where loggers and mill workers long have been at odds with the forest service
somehow sending a shovel seems symbolic maybe it will make a difference said cary hegreberg of helena mont executive vice president of the montana wood products association
most people understand shovels are a symbol of work that's something we have in common - we want to work he said
elko county commissioner mike nannini who helped organize the parade said shovels arrived by mail from as far away as rhode island and maryland
it's just a grassroots deal it's not just the west anymore these people are saying no more' he said
the jarbidge river in a remote canyon near the idaho border is home of the southernmost population of bull trout in north america
the 15-mile road leads to a trailhead for a wilderness and provides vehicle access to fishing and camping along the river
the elko county commission claims the forest service has no jurisdiction over the south canyon road along the river because the road was there before the humboldt national forest was established in the early 1900s
johnson and others threatened to rebuild the road by hand but a federal judge in reno issued a court order banning any work on the road in november
the controversy has prompted a congressional field hearing and has become a lightning rod for criticism of president clinton's proposal to protect millions of acres of roadless areas in national forests
nevada gov kenny guinn a republican offered his support for the protest in a letter to organizers on friday
since the vast majority of the public lands are in the west perhaps the bureaucrats in washington dc simply don't understand the impact their decisions have on our western way of life guinn said
one of the protesters was bob secrist of elko
i'm in the firewood business and the forest service is giving me a bad time they are supposed to manage the forest but they are just shutting it down and locking it up he said
the president wants to make everything roadless that's fine for the people in kansas but 85 percent of our land is controlled by the government in nevada we're expected to make a living on the other 15 percent he said
an active volcano spat out fire and rocks saturday night near the eastern congolese rebel stronghold at goma spreading panic among residents who thought they were under attack
the nyamuragira volcano one of two straddling rwanda's border with eastern congo became active wednesday when the rim turned red and occasional fire balls shot out resembling the sound of artillery residents said by telephone
we can see fire people are waking up thinking they've been attacked one resident who identified himself only as tenda said those near the volcano are leaving their homes
residents and an official at the ugandan consulate in goma said goma was not immediately threatened since the volcano's destruction had been directed toward virunga national park on the opposite side of the populated area however two neighborhoods had been evacuated they said
the two volcanoes have occasionally erupted since 1979 when the burning lava spilled into some sections of goma and forced the town to temporarily evacuate
the volcano turned active again in 1996 as more than 1 million rwandan hutu refugees began crossing back home into rwanda ending 2 1/2 years in exile in the aftermath of the 1994 genocide in rwanda
officials at the seismological institute in goma could not immediately be reached for comment
rebels in goma took up arms in august 1998 against president laurent kabila taking control of the eastern half of africa's third largest nation last summer the rebels and kabila concluded a peace accord with a shaky cease-fire agreement
acting president vladimir putin sent a prosecutor to chechnya on saturday to investigate the reported arrest of a russian journalist by russian security forces
the prosecutor will look into the circumstances of andrei babitsky's detention putin aide sergei yastrzhembsky said
yastrzhembsky gave no details of the arrest but said on russian television that babitsky did not have accreditation for working in chechnya the military grants such permission only to a handful of pro-government journalists
babitsky a radio liberty correspondent has angered russian officials with his consistent criticism of the chechnya war he has been missing since jan 15 when he last called his family and colleagues from the chechen capital grozny
citing security sources interfax reported friday that babitsky had been detained by russian security services in chechnya and charged with fighting in armed bands the rtr television channel cited a russian interior ministry spokesman as saying babitsky had been detained for not having proper accreditation
the russian government has accused babitsky in the past of backing the rebels secret service agents raided his moscow apartment jan 8 and seized photographs he took of dead russian soldiers said his wife lyuda babitskaya
the us-sponsored radio liberty sent its director to moscow to look into the case and the state department expressed concerns about infringements on media freedom in chechnya
journalists occasionally are detained by the strict military command in and near chechnya but usually are released quickly
a moroccan man who crossed the border from canada is being held as a material witness for the investigation of an algerian whose border arrest led to heightened security concerns
youssef karroum is not being held as a suspect said his lawyer gene grantham he's being held to determine if he knows anything about other ongoing investigations grantham said
karroum was detained thursday at blaine a border crossing about 100 miles north of seattle and on friday a us magistrate ordered him held as a material witness another court appearance was set for tuesday
federal officials treated the case with an unusual level of secrecy
however justice department sources told the seattle times that the case involves an investigation related to ahmed ressam the algerian arrested dec 14 in port angeles allegedly with a car full of explosives ressam has pleaded innocent to charges that he was planning a terrorist bombing
seattle was shaken by news that ressam had a motel reservation near the space needle the city later canceled new year's eve celebration at the park beneath the space needle because of security concerns although there was no specific threat
karroum was arrested by agents of the immigration and naturalization service and the customs service who became suspicious about his documentation the times reported in addition a computer check showed that his name had been red-flagged by the fbi the newspaper said
during a search of karroum's vehicle bomb-sniffing dogs reacted to traces of a chemical officials think may be the explosive nitroglycerin the times said however no bomb was found and law-enforcement sources said the dogs can be wrong and that further tests are required
law-enforcement officials told the times that they were unsure where karroum fits in the investigation
cuban president fidel castro is vowing to carry on protests for the return of elian gonzalez for 10 years if need be and says the 6-year-old's mother was practically kidnapped for her fatal journey toward the united states
speaking to a conference of economists friday castro blamed the disaster on the mother's boyfriend larazo rafael munero who organized the boat trip that ended in death for himself elisabeth brotons and nine other people off the florida coast
the mother was practically kidnapped along with the boy to make the trip castro said
what kind of ruffian is this guy castro asked we have 100 pages of reports on him apparently referring to police documents
according to sources quoted by the miami herald munero - who reportedly drove a taxi in the cuban city of cardenas - had fled to florida in june 1998 and returned to cuba later that year only to be jailed for several months
cuba's government and communist party have mounted daily demonstrations to support elian's father's demand that he be returned to cuba hundreds of thousands of people have marched through the streets chanting the name of the boy official news media call the elfin prince
we have never in the past put on such a display of people and public unity and i don't believe we will tire of it castro said we have the resources to go on for 10 years
elian rescued off the florida coast in an inner tube on nov 25 has been staying in miami with a paternal great-uncle who backed by anti-castro exile groups is trying to keep the boy in the united states
referring to munero castro said the first thing we had to do is verify what kind of man this hero is because we knew it would be the theory that it was the mother who dreamed of a land of freedom we know all the cliches
it was a mother who was practically kidnapped
the cuban leader called brotons an excellent girl who had suffered seven miscarriages before delivering elian
one who is born among eight pregnancies how desired must be that child whom they have taken by force from his father and grandmothers castro said
the child's paternal and maternal grandmothers were expected to continue a tour of the united states where they have been campaigning for elian's return the government's prensa latina news agency said
in the united states us rep dan burton r-ind said saturday that elian told him he didn't want to go back to cuba
he's a very intelligent young man and i was able to ask him without any coaching a couple of questions said burton who supports a measure to make elian a us citizen in order to impede administration efforts to return him to cuba
burton met with the boy for 30 minutes at the little havana home in miami where the boy is staying
the first question i asked him is how did he like living here and he said he liked it very much as he was blowing bubbles and then i said would you like to go back to cuba' and he was very firm in saying no and this without any coaching
about 200 chanting flag-waving protesters marched in front of the headquarters of the us immigration and naturalization service in miami demanding that elian be sent back to cuba the crowd yelled send elian home as a small plane towing a banner with the same slogan passed overhead
the march was organized by a pro-castro group the antonio maceo brigade
un talks here finally produced rules governing trade in genetically engineered products saturday nearly a year after previous talks collapsed in the face of international discord
the new rules are complex and many may be subject to legal challenges or interpretations but for now they contain language letting a country ban imports of a genetically modified product if it feels there is not enough scientific evidence showing the product is safe
it requires exporters to label shipments that contain genetically altered commodities such as corn or cotton it also tries to dictate how those safety rules will coexist with free trade rules governed by the world trade organization
the united states a major producer of genetically engineered products had opposed labeling and had fought import bans except in cases where the product is shown to be risky it was forced to make concessions on those and several other points
fighting back tears the conference's president juan mayr congratulated his colleagues on reaching a compromise
the adoption of this protocol represents a victory for the environment mayr said
the protocol is intended to protect the environment from damage due to genetically modified organisms environmentalists and some scientists worry that bioengineered plants animals and bacteria could wipe out native strains or spread their genetic advantages to weeds and other undesirable species
there's fish genes in fruit poultry genes in fish animal genes in plants growth hormones in milk insect genes in vegetables tree genes in grain and in the case of pork human genes in meat said steve gilman an organic farmer in stillwater ny
a first attempt to draw up a biosafety protocol ended last february in cartagena colombia when the united states and five partners blocked a pact that was acceptable to the other 125 countries
saturday's new agreement came after a week of intense negotiations that pitted the united states and its five allies in the talks - canada australia argentina chile and uruguay - against the european union and a coalition of developing nations as protesters stood outside in single-digit temperatures chanting hey ho gmos have got to go negotiators worked until just before dawn to hammer out the final details
the eu and developing nations had argued that countries should be allowed to refuse imports of a genetically modified product if little is known about its environmental effect the united states and its partners had disagreed saying many of the proposed rules would restrict trade
but the political situation changed in the last year with major us food producers like archer daniels midland and gerber either demanding that genetically modified products be segregated from other products or refusing to use them altogether scientific studies have suggested that monarch butterflies and other beneficial insects may be harmed by genetically engineered crops
and protests at the wto talks in seattle last month also suggested that the american public has concerns about genetically altered food
eu negotiators whose constituency strongly opposes genetic modifications in food used the changed climate to exact a number of concessions from the us delegation nonetheless us negotiators said they were satisfied with the final agreement
the agreement that we achieved is a very substantial improvement over the agreement we started with us undersecretary of state frank loy said
in the end the sides' most serious differences turned out to be over how the biosafety protocol would relate to wto rules and whether shipments of genetically modified commodities should be labeled
environmentalists have complained in recent years that the wto's free trade pact has overridden regulations meant to protect human and ecological health but saturday's agreement calls for the biosafety protocol and the wto rules to be mutually supportive with nothing intended to subordinate this protocol to other international agreements
under the protocol exporters will be required to apply the label may contain living modified organisms to all shipments containing genetically altered commodities the protocol allows for a revision of that labeling policy after two years
in a legal question mark the united states has neither signed nor ratified the biodiversity treaty that oversees the new protocol so technically the us is not bound to honor it
not being part of this treaty makes it more challenging for us here us negotiator david sandalow said
genetically modified crops are already widespread about 70 million acres of genetically engineered plants were cultivated worldwide in 1999 in the united states genetically engineered varieties account for about 25 percent of corn and 40 percent of soybeans
biotechnology proponents point to the potential of the technology to increase yields and improve nutrition
the longer i use it the more i believe in it said robert m boeding an iowa farmer who has grown genetically modified corn for the last five years he says the modified strain keeps him from having to use dangerous pesticides to protect his crop from insects
hundreds of neo-nazis demonstrated saturday at the site of germany's planned memorial to holocaust victims and also took the politically charged move of marching through berlin's landmark brandenburg gate
the extreme-right national party of germany had been banned by police from demonstrating out of fears of violence but a court late friday overturned the decision and allowed the event to go forward
hundreds of police blocked streets in central berlin to make way for the about 500 demonstrators who headed down the main under den linden boulevard to the site of the memorial
they then marched through the nearby brandenburg gate - a particularly symbolic act given that nazi troops during adolf hitler's reign once held torchlight processions through the gate during past neo-nazi demonstrations police have not allowed participants to go through the brandenburg gate
the demonstrators carried a banner at the head of their procession reading stop the memorial and some carried the old german red white and black national flag - one which had the word skinheads written on it
police said two arrests were made by people allegedly displaying banned symbols in germany spreading nazi propaganda is illegal authorities also stopped about 25 marchers from singing an ss song
at the same time a counter-demonstration was held by supporters of the memorial at several points during the neo-nazi demonstration opponents gathered in smaller groups and shouted nazis raus at the demonstrators meaning nazis get out
in the central city of goettingen a counter-demonstration against neo-nazis drew about 2000 participants the city had been the planned site of a demonstration by the nationalist party but authorities there had also banned it because of fears of violence
michel friedman a vice president of the central council of jews in germany called for no tolerance for racists at the goettingen event
police there said 22 people left and right extremists were taken into custody
german leaders on thursday held a ceremonial dedication for the holocaust memorial which will consist of a vast field of 2700 close-set concrete slabs resembling stones in a graveyard thursday was also germany's annual day of remembrance for victims of nazism established in 1996 to coincide with the day soviet soldiers liberated the auschwitz death camp in nazi-occupied poland in 1945
after 10 years of debate parliament last year approved the memorial the first in germany dedicated solely to the murdered jews of europe
nineteen city and state buildings in the city fail to provide equal access for people with disabilities said a report issued saturday by state assemblyman scott stringer
the report listed nearly 100 alleged violations of the american with disabilities act ada accessibility guidelines in buildings ranging from city hall to the department of motor vehicles
the city and state use a half-loafed approach to making government accessible to disability said stringer who was joined by a half dozen disabled activists
reported violations included elevator call buttons placed too high for a person in a wheelchair at the brooklyn municipal building and bronx borough hall none of the buildings surveyed was equipped with a text telephone tty or tdd for the hearing impaired
and many buildings reportedly had front doors that were far too heavy for a person in the wheelchair to open without help
if government can't provide this kind of access how can we demand private companies to do it stringer asked reporters this could all be remedied very easily
marty sesmer 62 who suffers from a circulatory disease that has forced him to use a wheelchair since 1983 said that he does not have equal access to many buildings
when i go to a municipal building i never know what i'm going to run into he said i usually have to bring someone with me to help me navigate some of these places
stringer said he will submit his findings to the state assembly and to the department of justice and will enjoin them to look into the reported violations
the americans with disabilities act passed in 1990 prohibits discrimination against the disabled in employment public accommodations transportation and telecommunications
the new york buildings department whose responsibility it is to make sure buildings adhere to the ada guidelines could not be reached for comment on saturday
officials at city hall and the offices of the queens and bronx borough presidents all of whose offices were cited in the report did not return calls seeking comment
about 200 chanting flag-waving protesters marched in front of ins headquarters saturday demanding that 6-year-old elian gonzalez be sent home to his father in cuba
but rep dan burton whose congressional maneuvering to keep elian in the united states has infuriated the boy's father said saturday that the 6-year-old told him he doesn't want to go back
he's a very intelligent young man and i was able to ask him without any coaching a couple of questions the indiana republican said after meeting for 30 minutes with elian at the home where the boy is staying with relatives
the first question i asked him is how did he like living here and he said he liked it very much as he was blowing bubbles and then i said would you like to go back to cuba' and he was very firm in saying no and this without any coaching
elian has been the subject of heated debate since he was found clinging to an inner tube nov 25 off the florida coast his mother and 10 others traveling with him drowned during an effort to leave cuba
elian's grandmothers were expected to continue a tour of the united states where they have been campaigning for elian's return cuba's prensa latina news agency said
in miami the protesters at the immigration and naturalization service office yelled send elian home as a small plane towing a banner with the same slogan passed overhead
cuban-americans among the group said they wanted to show that not all cuban-americans want elian to remain here they said the 6-year-old had been kidnapped and should be returned to his father
every child needs a father and a mother said juan morales a cuban who has lived in the united states for eight years if the mother dies the person directly responsible is the father and not the uncle and not the united states
andres gomez national coordinator of the antonio maceo brigade a group that organized the protest and advocates normalizing relations with cuba said the demonstrators have a noble purpose
we are coming together in this case in defense of the most fundamental rights of a human being which are the rights of a child he said
later saturday a demonstration was planned by the anti-castro democracy movement a group which wants elian to stay put the group planned to launch a flotilla to pay tribute to elizabeth brotons elian's mother
the ins has ruled elian should return to his father but its order has not been carried out because the government agreed to hold off until a federal court considers a challenge filed by the miami relatives
us district judge william hoeveler originally said he would hear arguments march 6 on whether the relative's lawsuit should be dismissed but on friday he moved that day up to feb 22
in an attempt to block elian's return to cuba burton earlier this month subpoenaed the boy to appear before the house government reform committee which he chairs
at the time elian's father expressed outrage what right does that man have juan miguel gonzalez said who is he he is no one i am the father
burton said it is unlikely that elian will actually appear before the committee but he didn't rule that out entirely
the justice department asserts that if elian is not returned to cuba it could hurt attempts to retrieve american children taken out of the country by a foreign-born parent against the wishes of the child's american parent
burton said the situations are not identical
we are talking about people who are leaving a totalitarian communist state he said
a nurse who was seriously injured in the 1998 bombing of a birmingham abortion clinic is suing fugitive suspect eric robert rudolph partly in an effort to block any profits he might receive from a book or movie her attorney said
emily lyons and her husband jeff are also seeking damages in the suit against rudolph which they filed thursday in federal court
she feels very strongly that he should never profit from his conduct involving the clinic said her attorney scott powell
lyons was arriving for work when a bomb exploded jan 29 1998 outside new woman all women health care the blast killed an off-duty birmingham policeman lyons lost her left eye and has undergone numerous operations
rudolph is charged in six bombings including the 1996 centennial park blast during the olympic games in atlanta that killed one person and injured 100 others
law enforcement has searched for rudolph for more than two years focusing on remote areas in western north carolina near his home
israeli prime minister ehud barak and palestinian leader yasser arafat will meet next week amid fading hopes for concluding the outline of a peace agreement by the deadline they set feb 13
if they don't meet it they'll reach some understanding about how to deal with that problem a senior us official said saturday after a 30-minute meeting between arafat and president clinton
the statement was the frankest admission yet that american mediators are likely to fall short of their target for a basic understanding about the future of jerusalem whether there will be a palestinian state and other knotty issues at the core of the arab-israeli dispute
the barak-arafat meeting will be held thursday or friday at erez a border crossing between israel and palestinian-held gaza and will focus on the major unresolved issues said the official who briefed reporters on condition of anonymity
he described the pursuit of the deadline as a formidable challenge it's very difficult to get there the official said
there were no american claims of progress after clinton saw arafat in the steigenberger hotel belvedere in this swiss ski resort they were among scores of world leaders attending an international economic forum
it was their second meeting in nine days nor was progress claimed after the last one at the white house in washington
the state department announced thursday that senior us mediator dennis ross would go to the middle east to help in the search for a settlement ross is due in israel on wednesday
lower-ranking israeli and palestinian negotiators are to hold intensive talks early this week at israel's red sea resort eilat
clinton has appealed to the two sides to seek less than 100 percent of their demands he said a settlement requires as much
secretary of state madeleine albright in her own flurry of diplomacy in davos saw king abdullah of jordan for 45 minutes saturday night and was to confer with arafat and egyptian foreign minister amr moussa on sunday
she then travels to moscow where she has separate meetings scheduled monday with foreign ministers david levy of israel and prince saud of saudi arabia they will be in moscow for a multilateral conference to promote understanding between the jewish state and its arab neighbors
in his meeting with albright jordan's king abdullah volunteered to have his kingdom act as host for the next regional economic conference state department spokesman james p rubin said
rubin also confirmed that neither syria nor lebanon would attend the moscow conference syria's government-controlled press has criticized the conference as divisive to arab unity
clinton albright and ross all are prepared to commit themselves to working on a day-by-day basis to try to reach an israeli-palestinian settlement the us official said saturday
palestinian officials have raised the possibility of shifting negotiations to washington if talks in the region do not produce an accord
on friday the palestinians accused barak of not being serious about reaching the feb 13 deadline
nabil shaath the palestinian planning minister said his negotiating team proposed that the talks be conducted in washington under clinton's close supervision but israel rejected the idea
also salim zanoun chairman of the palestine liberation organization's decision-making central council said the council will meet wednesday in gaza city to set the date for the declaration of an independent palestinian state
it appeared highly unlikely however that the palestinians would issue a unilateral declaration of independence and risk angering the americans before the september deadline for a peace treaty with israel
no one disputes the math
officer sean carroll squeezed off 16 rounds so did edward mcmellon kenneth boss added five shots and richard murphy four for a total of 41
nineteen of the bullets tore through the body of amadou diallo in a matter of seconds turning the 5-by-8-foot vestibule of his bronx apartment building into a dingy death trap
it might have ended there if diallo was an armed criminal as the police apparently feared instead he was a street vendor carrying only a pager and wallet
nearly a year later - with a backdrop mixing racial politics and a mother's well-publicized grief - a jury must decide whether the shooting of the west african immigrant by the four white officers was murder
jury selection for the officers' trial is set to begin monday the trial will be in albany ny because an appeals court took the unusual step of moving the case from the bronx it agreed with defense attorneys that a torrent of pretrial publicity and protests would make it impossible to find impartial jurors in new york city
last week justice joseph teresi ruled the trial could be televised - in part to ensure access to city residents - but that is unlikely to still anger over the change of venue
civil rights activists including the rev al sharpton have vowed to lead their followers to albany to rally behind the diallo family they also urged federal authorities to monitor a case they say symbolizes widespread police brutality against minorities
amadou's blood will feed the battle for justice for everyone his mother kadiatou diallo said last year after the officers were indicted on charges of second-degree murder
carroll 36 mcmellon 27 boss 28 and murphy 27 pleaded innocent but prosecutors allege they demonstrated a depraved indifference to human life by unleashing the barrage on a defenseless man
the defendants' decision not to testify before a grand jury left no option except murder charges carrying a maximum sentence of life in prison said bronx district attorney robert johnson
without their explanation what we have is four people driving up to a location pulling out their guns and killing an individual johnson said
defense attorneys and the city's powerful police union the patrolmen's benevolent association maintain the officers made a tragic mistake part of a plainclothes unit assigned to combat street crime they thought diallo 22 was reaching for a gun while lurking around the apartment building
the officers have signaled they will take the witness stand in their own defense
the case is about whether you give police officers the benefit of the doubt said mcmellon's attorney stephen worth you either somehow believe a bunch of cops thought what the hell we'll shoot this guy for no good reason' or you realize that they thought they were in danger of being shot at and took proper action
today many new yorkers know diallo's name and about the 41 bullets
but before their worlds collided at about 1240 am on feb 4 1999 the victim and the shooters navigated the city in relative anonymity
diallo's father guinean entrepreneur saikou amad diallo once hawked candy and cigarettes in senegal he later launched a career as a jewel trader he married kadiatou his second wife when she was only 14 they divorced in 1990
the eldest of the couple's four children diallo studied computers before leaving africa for new york in 1996 he peddled videotapes on the streets of manhattan and lived in a two-story red-brick building in a rough section of the bronx
the officers clean-cut looking products of more peaceful neighborhoods signed on with the nation's largest police department in time to ride a dramatic downturn in crime murders alone plummeted to 629 in 1998 from 2245 in 1990
the defendants were part of the roving street crime unit credited with driving down the numbers of shootings by arresting armed suspects the unit made nearly 4000 arrests and seized about 1000 guns in 1998 alone
but even before diallo killing complaints arose that street crime used unlawful stop-and-frisk tactics against young men of color - especially in the bronx a borough with a history of tension between minorities and police police officials have since come under fire for expanding the unit with inexperienced officers of the four defendants only carroll had been in the unit for more than a year
on the night of the shooting the officers were patrolling diallo's neighborhood in a ford taurus looking for violent suspects each was armed with a 16-shot semiautomatic pistol and wore a bulletproof vest three had been involved in previous shootings one fatal all were deemed justified
what happened in front of 1157 wheeler avenue in a span of less than a minute - and what was going through the defendants' minds - will be the focus of the trial expected to last more than a month
according to the defense the officers stopped their car after spotting diallo wearing a knit yankees cap duck into the shadows around his building with carroll and mcmellon approaching first and murphy and boss following he ignored an order to freeze then made a sudden move - drawing gunfire
the defense says that as the bullets flew carroll was so sure diallo was armed he yelled gun mcmellon fell backward as he and carroll retreated that further created an impression a gun battle was under way
we're talking about split-second decisions said steven brounstein the attorney for boss what if this had gone the other way what if boss held his fire while his partner was being shot it would have been a police funeral
the bronx district attorney's office has largely kept quiet about its case
but a civilian witness has said he heard two or three shots a two-second pause then another burst of fire the pause would support arguments that the officers had a chance to realize their mistake and hold fire yet didn't
the prosecution also is expected to use medical evidence to contend that diallo was dropped by the first bullets instantly ending any threat and meaning the officers continued shooting even though diallo was on the ground the defense contends the victim remained upright making him a perceived threat deserving of deadly force
an autopsy found diallo was hit 11 times in the legs five bullets went into the left side of body he was also hit once in the back right arm and in the front of his chest the bullets perforated his aorta spinal cord lungs liver spleen kidneys and intestines
afterward with diallo dead in the vestibule boss' voice could be heard over police radios calling for an ambulance
five days later kadiatou diallo arrived from guinea and went straight to the bronx television crews filmed a woman in traditional west african robes crying out her son's name as she arrived the scene of his death
in the weeks that followed a team of lawyers for diallo's estate began preparing a wrongful death lawsuit sure to seek millions of dollars in damages diallo was buried under a fig tree in an african village founded by his great-grandfather and more than 1200 people - including actress susan sarandon former mayor david dinkins and rep charles rangel - were arrested for civil disobedience during demonstrations at police headquarters
a more muted protest went on at 1157 wheeler mourners there covered the bullet-scarred vestibule with graffiti some still visible today
amadou one says your life was not in vain

after a bad year in 1998 the consensus among mid-atlantic fishing agencies is that the blue crab is doing ok
now it is the watermen who are hurting
for years debate surrounding the blue crab has centered largely on maintaining a sustainable population in the chesapeake and delaware bays it is feared that overfishing the blue crab could wipe out an industry worth more than $50 million a year on the chesapeake alone
several dozen watermen stuffed uncomfortably into the chairs of an ocean city convention center conference room saturday said it is time the debate focused on keeping watermen in business
i don't think the crab is in trouble i think the crabber is in trouble said tommy leggett who runs a boat out of hampton roads va on the elizabeth river
there are more crab pots in the water but watermen aren't pulling up any more crabs than previous years leggett said watermen are working more hours and spending more on fuel and equipment just to keep even
you have to work a lot more pots to get the same number of crabs he said and you need to do that just to keep up and pay the bills
leggett and others were gathered to hear a panel of biologists and state regulators gathered at the 26th annual east coast commercial fishermen's and aquaculture exposition talk about managing the blue crab population
the panel sounded a serious note during a three-day conference that features cocktail parties piles of free samples of fried seafood and oyster tonging contests
there is great concern about the future of the blue crab while 1999's harvest appears to be much better than the poor catch in 1998 the average size of the blue crabs seems to be shrinking
there were questions raised by watermen about when the crabs are plentiful the season didn't pick up particularly in the upper chesapeake bay until late july
years of blue crab studies will likely produce stricter regulation of crabbing in many states
delaware for example has legislation before its general assembly which would allow state agencies to control the number of blue crabs fished from the western half of the delaware bay
the chesapeake bay commission is urging both virginia and maryland to limit the rate of development on the shores of the chesapeake bay in order to reduce damage to the environment of the blue crab and other fish
but watermen say they are frustrated by the poor economy of their industry and that state agencies don't do much to help them
jim jeanks of leonardo nj said he took his crab pots out of sandy hook bay nearly 30 years ago because the catch wasn't big enough to justify the work he turned instead to clamming
now with blue crabs appearing to be in some abundance in new jersey waters he wants to crab again but can't afford the $10000 to get a state crabbing license
new jersey which limits the number of crabbing licenses it issues has given many of those commercial licenses to people whose lives don't depend on it he said
i make my living on the water and i can't get a crab license he said this makes me so mad i can't even tell you
many watermen said changes must be made to licensing and regulation to ensure that commercial crab fishing remains a viable industry
everybody has to gear up as much as they can and crab as much as they can just to keep up said steve konka a waterman out of baltimore
the situation of the watermen is something like a trap said douglas lipton an economist with the university of maryland's sea grant extension
there are more pots in the water but the overall catch hasn't changed - meaning fewer crabs in each pot that prompts the waterman to throw in even more pots to catch up and that just adds to the problem
the additional pots aren't catching any more crabs and that's what's leading to the reduced incomes lipton said we need to look at the regulations we have and ask is this working perhaps not
a key figure in the christian democrats' financial scandal has given the party's hesse state branch a 1000-plus page report on secret party money state christian democratic leaders said saturday
hesse has become a focus in the scandal over a network of financial schemes run by the christian democrats the conservative german party that led the government from the early 1980s until 1998 the hesse branch of the party said it would likely take a week to go through the report and after that it would be made public
horst weyrauch the accountant who prepared the report is the first witness who will be called in parliament's investigation of whether decisions by former chancellor helmut kohl's government were bought kohl has admitted taking up to $1 million in off-the-books donations for the party
according to a report in focus magazine saturday weyrauch had threatened the party leadership telling it not to force him to reveal information about secret party funds
party officials decided last week to threaten legal action against weyrauch after his remarks which focus said included an ominous statement when you want to know the truth then the republic totters
meanwhile new reports indicated the secret party funds extended even farther overseas than previously suspected
according to der spiegel magazine weyrauch and the longtime state party accountant in hesse prince casimir sayn-wittgenstein worked with people in paraguay to design a system to create fake estates the system was to be used to funnel money to the party
as a result of the scandal spiegel reported the christian democrats may have to pay $205 million back to the federal government
earlier this week hesse gov roland koch revealed that the state party had diverted more than $95 million to swiss bank accounts in 1983 the money was apparently sent abroad to flout stricter campaign finance laws
according to a report to be published sunday in the newspaper welt am sonntag money from the hesse accounts was passed on in considerable amounts to the national party however christian democrat financial officials said saturday the fact that amounts and dates of transactions seem to be similar doesn't necessarily indicate any connection
the party's federal office in berlin said it would keep in close touch with hesse officials to determine whether the millions held in secret swiss accounts by the state party are connected to the national party
kohl has refused to name the donors who gave the party the $1 million german president johannes rau indirectly called on kohl to reveal the names telling bild newspaper saturday that he saw no way to agree with an idea of honor that stands over law and the state
rau though has his own scandal to worry about some opposition politicians are now openly demanding that he resign for accepting free flights from a bank that had close ties to a state government while he was the state's governor
in a report saturday in focus deputy christian democratic chairman christian wulff called on rau to step down an indirect call for rau's resignation also came from conservative opposition leader michael glos of the christian social union in bavaria
on the sidelines of the christian democrats' troubles allegations of a plane scandal have been growing in recent months against the ruling social democrats in the state of north rhine-westphalia
earlier this week another social democrat longtime north rhine-westphalia finance minister heinz schleusser resigned after admitting a female companion went along on two of 49 free plane trips he had taken
rau's lawyer this week released a list of 44 flights rau made while governor paid for by the westdeutschen landesbank a state investigation is probing whether rau took the flights for private purposes
russian forces advanced through snowy alleys and seized shell-shattered high-rises from rebels saturday in the chechen capital grozny but chechens said they were letting the russians move in so they could attack from behind
the russians' assault on grozny has concentrated for more than a week on minutka square which they advanced toward on saturday taking the square would give federal forces leverage to push the rebels out of the city center
meanwhile russian presidential aide sergei yastrzhembsky said 54 rebels surrendered in northeast grozny to forces led by pro-moscow chechen leader bislan gantamirov speaking on russia's ort television yastrzhembsky called the move a psychological breakthrough many of the rebels were wounded
but up to 3000 fighters are believed to remain in grozny and it was unclear whether the surrender would mean much in the monthlong battle for the city though gantamirov claimed friday he had persuaded some rebel commanders to give up arms pro-moscow chechens are deeply distrusted in the breakaway republic and gantamirov's previous claims have often proven false
russian troops have advanced on minutka square along side streets and were battling chechen fighters some 500 yards from the square said senior chechen rebel commander mumadi saidayev russian commanders had earlier claimed to be closer to the square but this was apparently the first time the rebels admitted the russians had made it so close
a top russian commander col gen valery manilov said the russians have seized several high-rise buildings in the leninsky and oktyabrsky districts to the north and south of minutka from rebel snipers who had hindered the russians' advance
but saidayev the chechen commander said the russians were being allowed to advance so they could be trapped and attacked by chechen fighters from the rear the interfax news agency reported that tactic inflicted severe losses on russian troops during the last chechnya war from 1994 to 1996
a chechen fighter who slipped through a supposed russian blockade and left grozny saturday said rebels have pulled back from some positions in outlying neighborhoods to avoid scattering their forces but were preparing strong defenses closer to the center of the city
the fighter who asked to be identified only by his first name bislan said rebel forces were positioned behind russian troops ready to stage surprise attacks despite the russians' claims of progress federal troops control only a few blocks in several districts of grozny bislan said
artillery and tank fire rained on grozny from all sides saturday the russian military command said warplanes and helicopter gunships also bombarded mountainous rebel outposts in southern chechnya
moscow sent troops into chechnya in september after an invasion by chechen-based militants into the neighboring russian republic of dagestan in august deadly apartment bombings in several russian cities also were blamed on chechens
international criticism of the war has been building un secretary general kofi annan wrapping up a trip to moscow on saturday reiterated his call for an end to the fighting
no one can support or encourage terrorism but one should take steps to protect civilians he told the itar-tass news agency
turkish prime minister bulent ecevit said saturday he was disheartened by moscow's tactics and concerned about other caucasian hot spots
we have expressed our disillusionment with the russian administration for the methods they used in trying to promote the unity of their country for having taken the people directly as their targets ecevit said at an economic conference in davos switzerland
maureen kanka one of the nation's best-known crusaders for laws to warn parents about sex offenders now says it is time for new jersey to use the internet for a tougher megan's law
and her hometown state senator peter inverso r-mercer who helped kanka convert her family tragedy into a groundbreaking statute has agreed to help her and has arranged a meeting with the state attorney general to discuss the matter
kanka's daughter 7-year-old megan was killed in 1994 by a convicted sex offender who lived across the street but whose criminal past was a secret to his hamilton township neighbors jesse timmendequas now sits on new jersey's death row for the crime
the crime triggered a spate of megan's law sex offender laws across the united states and as well as a federal law ordering state officials to share information on sex offender movements with other states
new jersey's law provides for community notification door-to-door when the highest risk offenders move in or get out of prison when offenders are deemed to pose a moderate risk only officials at schools daycare centers and facilities with custody of children receive the notification
kanka told the associated press friday she wants all parents no matter where they live to have access to complete listings of sex offenders' names addresses and photos on internet web sites or at local police departments which could be equipped with cd-roms developed by the state
kanka claimed she has seen such systems in operation in california and other states
if other states are capable of doing it then so are we kanka said we need to have a better notification law i think when you look at the number of notifications that are actually going out it is minimal for the number of offenders there are in this state
state figures show that of 6513 offenders registered with local authorities notifications have been conducted on only 1042 and of those only 110 have been door-to-door for offenders deemed to pose a high risk
inverso said he is ready to sponsor a tougher megan's law especially now that the existing law has been successfully defended in state and federal courts
i am leaning toward the idea of making information more accessible inverso said i have been tussling for a long time with people not having information when they want to buy a home
neighborhood notifications about high-risk sex offenders are limited to residents in a carefully proscribed area potential homebuyers are not included they get the notice only after moving in
it's wrong that people can't get the information until they actually move into a residence inverso said i think the time may have come that we have to look at some of these options
i know that people in this state are not happy with the current law when it was explained to them kanka said they were under the impression you would be able to find out more
kanka said she has spent countless hours traveling the state to meet with parents' groups and ptas and they are not pleased with it and i do not blame them
kanka acknowledges her proposal for a new internet registry might exceed the limits courts have stipulated to resolve this kanka said it is time to amend the new jersey constitution
we have amended the constitution for other things that in my opinion are a lot less important than this kanka said we can never lose sight of the fact that anyone convicted of any type of crime it is public record if you know how to get it it is available to everyone
kanka does not fault the current new jersey law noting it provided a purpose and goal in her life at an excruciating time
we were going through a heavy trauma the loss of our daughter she said it was something to start with and i thought it was a wonderful start there was always the notion that we would go further
as for the current law us district judge joseph irenas last week ordered farmer to bring more uniformity to the conduct of community notifications to prevent leaks irenas also issued an order to have all such notifications halted provided a federal appeals court agrees
trying to ease a humanitarian crisis that imperils tanzania and burundi the defense ministers of both nations said saturday that security along their border has improved and urged a speedy end to burundi's civil war
fighting between hutu rebels and the tutsi-dominated army has killed more than 200000 burundians since fighting started six years ago and has driven at least 300000 more people into un-operated refugee camps in neighboring tanzania
for months the burundian government has bitterly accused tanzania of winking at rebel recruitment in the refugee camps and condoning cross-border raids by the insurgents just as rancorously tanzania has denied the allegations saying it has devoted meager resources to care for the refugees at the expense of its own people
on saturday none of the recent vitriol was evident
a burundian delegation led by defense minister cyrille ndayirukiye said tanzania had strengthened security measures along the frontier the officials said they were not training the rebels fighting to oust burundian president pierre buyoya
a statement issued at the end of the one-day talks between ndayirukiye and his tanzanian counterpart edgar maokoka majogo also said the burundian government would create favorable conditions for the conducive return of the refugees burundian officials said that was a reference to burundi's support for a peace plan mediated by former south african president nelson mandela
the mandela-led peace talks began in 1998 they are set to resume next month in the northern tanzanian town of arusha
mandela said monday that president clinton has pledged to play a personal role in helping bring peace to the central african nation embroiled in war since tutsi paratroopers killed the country's first democratically elected president a hutu tutsis while a minority control burundi's political military and financial institutions
besides the hundreds of thousands of refugees who have fled into tanzania the burundian army has herded up to 350000 people into internal regroupment camps since september
the army says the relocation was necessary to stem escalating rebel attacks on the burundian capital bujumbura but international human rights groups have condemned the camps as breeding grounds for hunger disease and more violence
a confessed member of a spy ring was sentenced to seven years in prison for attempting to infiltrate us military installations in florida for the cuban government
alejandro alonso a us citizen born in des moines iowa was the first member of the group to be sentenced he had pleaded guilty to being an agent for a foreign country five others who have pleaded guilty are awaiting sentencing
i can only say that i did wrong alonso said after sentencing friday i am repentant i apologize to this court and to the whole world
alonso was charged with trying to penetrate us military bases infiltrate anti-castro exile groups and manipulate us media and political organizations
prosecutors said his assignment was to report on the cuban-exile group democracy movement he joined exile demonstrations disclosed the names of participants and reported on related us coast guard activity prosecutors said
he was one of 10 people arrested in september 1998 in connection with the spy ring four others were added to the list of defendants in may 1999
after his arrest alonso told investigators where to find a fake identification kit a page of codes and a pad of water-soluble paper used for secret messages
prosecutors said the ring tried to infiltrate the us southern command and planted an agent at the us navy's boca chica naval air station near key west
un investigators have recommended that the world body establish a human rights tribunal to prosecute those responsible for atrocities in east timor the bbc and people familiar with the investigators' report said saturday
the proposed tribunal would be somewhat different from the united nations' two established tribunals in that the investigators call for participation by indonesia and east timor the tribunal would be seated in both countries rather than in a neutral setting according to the sources
it isn't clear however that the security council would support an inquiry for indonesia which is carrying out its own investigation into the violence us ambassador richard holbrooke who visited east timor late last year has said he hoped another tribunal wouldn't be necessary
the rights experts calling for a tribunal said the united nations should first determine who was responsible by conducting further investigations into the wave of violence that tore through east timor before and after its aug 30 vote for independence the bbc and the sources said
east timor's people voted overwhelmingly in a un-organized ballot to separate from indonesia which invaded the former portuguese colony in 1975 and later annexed it
indonesian-backed militias went on a weeks-long killing and looting rampage to protest the results destroying large parts of the territory and driving tens of thousands of east timorese into neighboring indonesian-controlled west timor
the report to be officially released monday comes after the un commission of inquiry visited east timor and indonesia late last year to conduct preliminary investigations into allegations of serious violations of fundamental human rights and international humanitarian law
the united nations should establish an international human rights tribunal consisting of judges appointed by the united nations preferably with the participation of members from east timor and indonesia the investigators' report concluded according to a source reading from the document
indonesia immediately rejected the proposed tribunal saying it was under no legal obligation to accept the recommendations of the un inquiry the british broadcasting corp said
in an angry letter to secretary-general kofi annan accompanying the report indonesian foreign minister alwi abdurrahman shihab said the report was biased and dismissed the accusations as totally false and baseless the bbc said he also warned that setting up a un tribunal would create obstacles in the promotion of friendly relations between indonesia and east timor
in his own accompanying letter annan said it would be up to the general assembly security council and the geneva-based commission on human rights to decide what further action was required according to the source
annan did say however that he would strengthen the ability of the un mission running east timor to investigate the allegations in collaboration with the ongoing indonesian investigation
the security council on two previous occasions has set up international tribunals - for crimes committed during rwanda's 1994 genocide and the wars in the former yugoslavia those tribunals were set up in third countries arusha tanzania for the rwandan tribunal and the hague netherlands for the yugoslav tribunal
in the report members of the human rights commission of inquiry said national efforts by the indonesian government to prosecute those responsible would not be sufficient
an indonesian law under consideration to deal with human rights abuses committed prior to aug 8 was beset with problems and if enacted would not be efficacious the rights investigators concluded
while they hadn't seen the final draft of the law they noted that since most crimes were committed in east timor the indonesians might not be able to investigate the allegations fully similarly east timorese might not be willing to travel outside of the territory to testify the report said
reversing a position held for decades the government has concluded for the first time that many workers who built america's nuclear weapons likely became ill because of exposure to radiation or toxic chemicals officials said saturday
the findings based on a review of dozens of studies and raw medical data covering an estimated 600000 workers at 14 nuclear weapons sites could lead to compensation to the families of some of the workers many were unaware that they were being exposed to such health risks
while the draft report of the studies did not show a direct causal link between workplace exposures and specific illnesses it found that workers at the plants suffered higher than normal rates of a wide range of cancers and clearly were exposed to cancer-causing radiation and chemicals in the workplace
the studies reviewed by a special task force examined health records and other data covering three decades of the cold war from the late 1940s into the 1960s an official familiar with the report emphasized it does not relate to workers' conditions today
but the draft report which president clinton ordered last july marks a reversal in the government's long-standing position that no links exist between work conducted at the cold war-era weapons plants and later illnesses that argument has stymied numerous lawsuits seeking compensation
while the compensation issue has yet to be resolved the government now is acknowledging that hundreds - perhaps thousands - of workers may well have been made sick by their working environment
it does appear that in the doe complex there is a direct link between exposure and the possibility of contamination energy secretary bill richardson said in davos switzerland where he is accompanying president clinton at an economic forum
in an interview with the associated press richardson cautioned that the findings are preliminary and won't be completed for several months still richardson said if the findings are borne out the honorable thing for the government to do is to protect its workers past and present including compensation
the report said elevated rates of 22 categories of cancer were found among workers at 14 facilities in the department's atomic weapons complex they included leukemia hodgkin's lymphoma and cancers of the prostate kidney salivary gland and lung
the exposures we are seeing are in excess of those in similar population groups a source familiar with the report said we don't know what the cause is but it's clearly related to exposure there in the workplace
president clinton ordered the review after the energy department concluded the government should compensate workers who had developed an incurable lung disease because of exposure to beryllium a material used in nuclear weapons production
richardson and the white house wanted to determine if other nuclear weapons plant workers likewise should be compensated because of exposure to plutonium uranium and a variety of radioactive or highly toxic substances the interagency group reviewed dozens of epidemiological studies raw health data and other documents many of which in the past have been dismissed by the government
the draft report makes no conclusion on compensation which will be examined in the coming months recommendations are likely in the final report one official said compensation most likely would be to families in the hundreds not thousands although the number at this time remains little more than a guess
clinton will use the final report to develop a recommendation to congress which is responsible for providing the money
the draft report's conclusions were first reported saturday by the new york times
daniel j guttman an attorney for the paper allied-industrial chemical and energy workers union told the times the government turnabout was stunning because for years the government has marginalized the risks to the thousands of weapons plant workers
the report's findings included workers at plutonium production facilities at savannah river in south carolina and hanford in washington state the rocky flats plant near denver where plutonium was molded into weapons components uranium enrichment and processing plants at the oak ridge tenn complex the fernald uranium processing plant near cincinnati and the lawrence livermore and los alamos national laboratories in california and new mexico respectively
none of the plants still produce nuclear weapons
a moroccan man who crossed the border from canada is being held as a material witness for the investigation of an algerian whose border arrest led to heightened security concerns the seattle times reported saturday
youssef karroum is not being held as a suspect said his lawyer gene grantham he's being held to determine if he knows anything about other ongoing investigations grantham said
karroum was detained thursday at blaine a border crossing about 100 miles north of seattle and on friday a us magistrate ordered him held as a material witness another court appearance was set for tuesday
federal officials treated the case with an unusual level of secrecy
however justice department sources told the seattle times that the case involves an investigation related to ahmed ressam the algerian arrested dec 14 in port angeles allegedly with a car full of explosives ressam has pleaded innocent to charges that he was planning a terrorist bombing
seattle was shaken by news that ressam had a motel reservation near the space needle the city later canceled new year's eve celebration at the park beneath the space needle because of security concerns although there was no specific threat
karroum was arrested by agents of the immigration and naturalization service and the customs service who became suspicious about his documentation the times reported in addition a computer check showed that his name had been red-flagged by the fbi the newspaper said
during a search of karroum's vehicle bomb-sniffing dogs reacted to traces of a chemical officials think may be the explosive nitroglycerin the times said however no bomb was found and law-enforcement sources said the dogs can be wrong and that further tests are required
law-enforcement officials told the times that they were unsure where karroum fits in the investigation
in a country famed for chocolate and fondue eaten in fine restaurants the president of the united states ordered pizza and diet coke at a roadside filling station's cafe
blowing snow denied him his usual helicopter ride so president clinton had to be driven down a snowy swiss mountainside saturday from the world economic forum at davos to zurich where air force one waited to take him home
the presidential motorcade of around 30 vehicles stopped at the bp station outside niederurnen two-thirds of the way through the three-hour drive
in the attached cafe clinton and two advisers sat on stools at the dark formica lunch counter and ordered their very american snacks an elderly swiss man in a red sweater on the stool beside clinton's continued eating his lunch and minding his own business although he did look peculiarly at his neighbor
about 15 white house aides and a like number of secret service agents schmoozed around the cafe when he finished the pizza and soda clinton ordered a cup of coffee and meandered through the dining room chatting with patrons
before he left clinton bought three swatches although he did not says whose wrists the watches would grace
a jury has found an essex county man guilty of a murder-for-hire plot in which his wife died of drowning after water was forced down her throat in the couple's northern new york home
saturday afternoon's verdict means jeffrey glanda 49 could face the death penalty or life in prison
the body of jeannine glanda was discovered in august 1997 in a ford explorer that was partially submerged in a nearby lake according to testimony glanda offered and associate nicholas pecararo $15000 a new pickup truck and a snowmobile to help commit the murder
in his closing argument friday lead defense counsel dennis schlenker attacked the testimony of pecararo and julius elmore - the prosecutions star witnesses - calling them the most despicable human beings he ever met according to the plattsburgh press-republican
pecararo had testified he and glanda attacked and killed mrs glanda but the defense tried to argue that pecararo committed the murder and lied to skirt the death penalty saying that someone else killed the woman
district attorney ronald briggs in closing arguments friday described the breakdown of the glandas' relationship in 1994 their separation and how mr glanda offered plattsburgh auto mechanic donald hilborn $10000 in 1996 to kill mrs glanda
briggs then fast-forwarded to 1997 citing pecararo's testimony
pecararo testified that after glanda attacked his wife in her home he shocked her with a stun gun while pecararo held her
glanda allegedly then beat her and poured large amounts of water down her throat until she died authorities said
glanda ordered pecararo to have sex with her but he refused pecararo said
glanda is a court reporter who knows about dna evidence that sexual contact would leave and was trying to frame pecararo briggs said
pecararo said he took the body to upper cascade lake in keene and dumped it and her ford explorer into the lake
kimberly musgrove testified she heard the splash when the explorer hit and kevin reynolds said he found mrs glanda's purse and some personal belongings on route 73 near where her body was found
the medical examiner couldn't estimate the moment of death but ruled she died by being strangled and having water poured down her throat
briggs said pecararo testified because of guilt
the defendant could control nicholas pecararo's actions but could not control his soul briggs told the jury
briggs argued that glanda told hilborn and pecararo the same thing specifically that he wanted mrs glanda dead and it had to look like an accident to collect on the insurance money
glanda had taken out three insurance policies on his wife the last one 18 days before her death according to testimony the husband would have received $130000 through the policies
money is the oldest motive in the world briggs said
thursday state supreme court justice g thomas moynihan instructed the jury to ignore testimony from mrs glanda's divorce attorney william cantwell he had said he was working on custody papers for mrs glanda four weeks before his client's death
glanda faces the death penalty or life without parole when he is sentenced
more than 1000 anti-free trade activists defied a protest ban saturday and staged a hectic demonstration at a gathering of the world's political and corporate elite in this secluded alpine resort
some of the protesters - including environmentalists and anarchists - broke windows at a mcdonald's restaurant and vandalized several cars others burned an american flag they had pulled down from the facade of a luxury hotel where most of the world leaders are staying and used police barricades to try to break the hotel's windows
but at least davos didn't become a second seattle said local government president peter aliesch in reference to the riots during december's world trade organization meeting
two police officers were injured though not seriously officials said
the protests took place outside the site where president clinton delivered a speech to the gathered leaders
after several hours and under increasingly heavy snow the protesters dispersed with the cry we'll be back and some of them singing the communist anthem the internationale
swiss president adolf ogi criticized the skirmishes
the use of force is extremely regrettable he told journalists the world economic forum which organizes the davos meeting deplored that a limited number of demonstrators chose violence over dialogue
police - although equipped with full riot gear - kept a deliberately nonconfrontational approach even when under assault from snowballs blocks of ice ski sticks and other makeshift weapons only two people were arrested
despite having declared a ban on all protests during clinton's visit and calling out troops for extra backup authorities made no attempt to stop the first demonstrators as they entered the long narrow main street through the village but they then seemed to be taken by surprise as an estimated 1300 protesters pushed through control barriers
firing warning shots security forces retreated to less than 500 yards from the conference center and hotel hosting clinton they then barricaded off the street with land cruisers equipped with huge metal grids to prevent further disruption
yankee clinton go home read one typical banner don't let the multinationals destroy the people resist read another
the new spirit of davos resistance against international exploitation declared another banner in reference to the conference organizers' oft-repeated claims that it is the spirit of davos that attracts hundreds of global political and business leaders each year
the critics say they have the same concerns about the world economic forum as about the world trade organization that it is undemocratic secretive and only concerned with maximizing commercial profits they say that vital deals and decisions are struck behind closed doors with little consideration shown to public concerns for example on genetically modified foods
radical french farmers' unions which have campaigned against mcdonald's in france and the globalization it represents and which were out in force in seattle were among the protesters
our concerns need to be more represented in everyday public opinion said alain pulles one of the farmers
many of the demonstrators were clad in ski gear to escape official attention others were masked and belonged to anarchist groups
an ap photographer was roughed up as he took a picture of a demonstrator felling a police officer with a cross country ski
he appeared out of the blue back in october clad only in a dirty white robe as he walked barefoot along the two-lane highway into this struggling former coal town
folks pointed at first as the man with the shoulder-length hair and scruffy beard preached to whoever would listen before long though many in this largely roman catholic community were embracing him as a holy man
he was in the car with me and a man came up and started banging on the window said the rev gerard f angelo pastor of the shrine of the sacred heart of jesus he said thank you so much for what you're doing i haven't been to church in 25 years and now i'm going again his effect on people is amazing
with hundreds of people gathering in fire halls gymnasiums and open fields to listen to the stranger his presence has some worried that the community has opened its hearts and homes too readily to someone they know little about
but his supporters fervent in their devotion say they know all they need to know the soft-spoken nomad is a messenger of god
i would walk through fire for him said connie muir a roman catholic who took him in to live with her family when it became too cold to sleep outside he's blessed by the holy spirit people's hearts are really changed after they've heard him
though he has preached for up to six hours at a stretch he is a man of few words when it comes to himself
in interviews he would not divulge his birthplace or background saying it would detract from his message the robe and messianic appearance he says bring attention to his ministry and make him more approachable
when anyone asks his name he replies what's your name he says it is part of a hebrew tradition to not reveal one's name to a person until you become their friend and it is what the locals now call him
police checked his background and found nothing of concern he was arrested in greenfield ohio in august after he refused to stop preaching to a crowd that became unruly when police tried to break up the gathering
he was identified in a police affidavit as carl j joseph 39
the disorderly conduct charge was dismissed and hazleton police said they have yet to receive any complaints about joseph
he says his nine-year trek has brought him to 47 states and 13 countries but never has he remained in one place for so long before
people here have been wonderful there's such a great need for spirituality today he said people feel desolate because they have gotten away from god and his church
hazleton - population 23000 - and other towns in the region have gone through troubled times since the coal industry went bust decades ago boarded-up storefronts line the eastern pennsylvania city's main thoroughfare and the unemployment rate for luzerne county hovers around 6 percent
lots of people around here are hurting and this guy is the only sign of hope some of them have seen in a long time said resident robert clark it worries me because people are putting all this stock in a guy who to me seems like he's got a screw loose
joseph has spoken to as many as 2000 people at one gathering in hazleton and it is not uncommon to see several dozen people standing in a field at 2 am listening to him preach
sam lesante host of a local cable program has had him on his show four times - once for a three-hour call-in special
for three solid hours the phones were continuously lit up - they just rang and rang and rang lesante said
his burgeoning popularity as well as the nearly unrestricted access he has been given in local catholic schools and hospitals is causing some worry
carl has always been welcome here to pray with us said monsignor michael j delaney pastor of st gabriel's church in hazleton the unusual element of his ministry was a concern being it's unusual we also know we have to be both welcoming and cautious - but we wish him well in his efforts
several religious leaders declined to speak publicly saying they did not want to further heighten disagreements regarding joseph within the religious community
others say that preaching the gospel is nothing but a good thing pointing out that what's your name is not seeking financial gain he turns over all money and gifts he receives to local parishes except for sandals he received recently because he did not own a pair of shoes
as word spreads joseph is beginning to bring his ministry to neighboring towns like mahanoy city a community of 5000 about 20 miles southwest of hazleton he has been staying at the rectory of st joseph's church
during a recent two-hour session at the mahanoy city fire hall what's your name told a crowd of several hundred people not to abandon their faith though he identifies himself as roman catholic he says his message is for all christians
i encourage everyone to get into communication with god again he said as the crowd nodded in agreement i've experienced so many different places so many different people so many different cultures but i've never learned more than i have from prayer
he said he will remain in the area as long as there is a need for his words
he could be here a while or he could be gone tomorrow muir said i'd like to see him stay around for a long time
american airlines and one of its pilots likely will be assigned part of the blame when federal investigators issue a report on the june 1 airport crash that killed 11 people an airline official said saturday
we bear a heavy responsibility here said john hotard an airline spokesman
on friday the national transportation safety board concluded a three-day hearing on the crash of american airlines flight 1420
the ntsb won't issue a report with its determination of the probable cause of the crash until some time later
but hotard said he expects the report will put a major share of the responsibility on the airline and the plane's chief pilot richard buschmann for the decision to land during a raging thunderstorm
it's fairly cut and dried hotard said knowing the ntsb that may be where they go - that he shouldn't have landed any way
the mcdonnell-douglas md-82 carrying 145 passengers and crew landed off-center and then barreled off the end of the runway striking metal supports for a lighting system breaking apart and catching fire
buschmann and 10 passengers died and 110 others were injured
aviation experts testified friday that the plane could have stopped on the runway even though it was wet and there was a steady crosswind of about 25 mph
but the plane's braking was hindered because its spoilers - wing panels that help deceleration by putting more weight on the wheels - were not deployed said thomas yager a nasa research engineer who specializes in runway braking
co-pilot michael origel has testified that he believed buschmann set the spoilers to deploy automatically upon landing but origel whose duty it was to confirm the task said he could not recall the position of the spoiler handle before the accident
instances in which spoilers have not deployed when properly set are rare said robert baker vice chairman of american airlines' parent company amr corp
experts said the plane's deceleration also was impeded because the pilots did not apply wheel brakes until 11 seconds after touchdown - choosing to operate them manually rather than automatically
however the head of the ntsb reserved his harshest criticism at the conclusion of the hearings for the emergency response team survivors endured 18 minutes of being pelted with hail and heavy rain before the first emergency crew radioed that there were walking wounded and asked for a bus to take them to shelter
we have to look at the cold reality of how long that response took and see if maybe you all can come up with some real improvements and set a model for the nation ntsb chairman james hall said friday night
four minutes after seeing the plane touch down an air traffic controller called for help because he got no response from the crew it took an additional six minutes before firefighters realized they had gone to the wrong end of the runway and when firefighters got to the correct end they had to swing around and unlock a chained gate to reach the crash site
fire chief lawrence tyner defended the department's response saying that the four firefighters had to drive their three trucks slowly in order to see through the heavy rain more firefighters arrived after they located the crash site
no one on that night wanted to find that aircraft any quicker than those four men tyner said they did the very best they could with the information they had
in a surprise operation in several cities spanish police on saturday arrested eight people who allegedly cooperated with gunmen fighting for independence of the basque region
the operation which began with 270 police officers conducting a pre-dawn raid was aimed at cutting off fundraising and international diplomacy efforts of the separatist organization eta the interior ministry said in a statement
eta has waged a 32-year-old campaign to win independence for the basque region which straddles the border of france and spain the group is believed to have killed about 800 people since its inception
the statement said the operation practically eliminated the international relations apparatus which gives logistical support to member and collaborators of eta in europe and the iberian peninsula
television news tve citing unidentified police sources said several of those arrested belong to herri batasuna a party widely seen as the political wing of eta
justice minister margarita mariscal de gante said those arrested have a very clear and unmistakable connection with armed bands and denied the operation had political motivations against herri batasuna
the state news agency efe also citing unidentified police sources said the arrests took place in the basque cities of vitoria tudela bilbao portugalete and in the madrid airport following a two-year police investigation
the agency said police also searched the homes of several of those arrested seizing documents
the arrests come a little more than a week after a car-bomb attack blamed on eta that killed an army colonel in madrid and sparked mass demonstrations nationwide to call for peace in the most recent rally about 25000 people marched saturday in the northern city of pamplona
in december eta announced an end to a 14-month truce sparking fears of a resurgence of separatist violence in spain
israeli-backed militiamen killed two guerrillas in a clash in southern lebanon early saturday militia officials said
officials of the south lebanon army a 2500-member militia supported by israel said the guerrillas' bodies were retrieved and taken to the border town of marjayoun where they were shown to local journalists
sla officials in marjayoun said the guerrillas were killed in a battle with sla fighters around ali taher one of a string of outposts along the edge of a border zone that israel set up in 1985 to protect its northern towns from cross-border attacks in jerusalem an israeli army spokesman confirmed the deaths
no sla members were hurt in the fighting the militia officials said there was no immediate comment from lebanese guerrilla groups
in addition to the 2500 sla militiamen about 1500 israeli soldiers are deployed in the border zone guerrillas of hezbollah amal and other groups have been fighting for years to end the occupation
ten days after a disastrous oil spill polluted rio's guanabara bay environmental officials have discovered another leaky oil pipeline belonging to the government petroleum company petrobras
the small leak was discovered in a line near an oil refinery in cubatao about 40 miles southeast of sao paulo the sao paulo state environmental office said
about 52 gallons of a substance used to dilute fuel oil leaked out environmental engineer maria alencar said in a televised interview from the site she described the environmental impact as negligible still she said petrobras could be fined if investigators find the leak occurred due to negligence or inadequate maintenance
petrobras was fined a record $284 million for the disastrous leak of some 338000 gallons of crude oil from the reduc refinery into guanabara bay last week the company got a 30 percent discount for paying the fine in cash
the oil from the reduc spill washed up on beaches and spread through protected mangrove swamps an important breeding ground for fish and wildlife the federal environmental protection agency ibama said it will take the area at least a decade to recover
hungarian premier viktor orban on saturday stepped down as chairman of the leading party in hungary's coalition government to concentrate on running the country
orban said that in his efforts to improve conditions in hungary he has neglected his party fidesz which he has run since 1993
over the past year and a half since i have been premier i often could not separate my work as prime minister and of party chairman orban told a party congress convened to elect a new chairman
deputy chairman laszlo koever the only candidate was unanimously elected to replace him
hungary's future appears promising the country was admitted to nato and is a frontrunner for european union membership but the popularity of orban's center-right government has steadily declined
my task will be to coordinate party work and to prepare it for the 2002 general elections so that it will be strong enough to win again koever said after the party congress
the second ice storm in a week made highways treacherous saturday leaving the pavement so slippery in places people couldn't stand let alone drive
cars slid into police cars and trucks trying to clear the roads and ice-covered overpasses and interchanges were shut down across the state
another storm earlier in the week had knocked out electrical service to thousands of customers
it just happened so suddenly said state department of transportation spokeswoman kim law you look out your window and not see any ice on the trees and assume it's ok well it's anything but
the ice was blamed for a 47-car pileup at the junction of interstate 20 and interstates 75/85 in downtown atlanta later 12 other cars slid into each other on i-20 one traffic death in the state was blamed on the ice
we've had vehicles slide into 10 of our officer's cars said dekalb county police spokeswoman mikki jones everyone needs to slow down we're seeing people try to drive 70 miles an hour on the interstate
as the weather system turned up the east coast storm advisories were posted saturday across south and north carolina where residents were still digging out after last week's record snowfall of 20 inches an ice storm warning was in effect for northeastern alabama
the same storm had dropped more than a foot of snow in areas across the plains and the south and was blamed for three deaths in arkansas one in louisiana and five in missouri a 14-year-old boy died in a sledding accident near memphis tenn
rick cantrell and john schifko hoped to see atlanta's sights after driving from st louis for the super bowl but watching drivers not used to ice trying to maneuver on the slick pavement made them think again
this is child's play compared to what we get in st louis but the worst hazard is everyone else cantrell said we saw people going too fast on the interstate and spin out left and right
the storm also iced roads in kentucky on saturday forcing police to close a 10-mile section of interstate 75 it's utter chaos this morning brother said state police sgt russ harney in richmond
in lexington ky ken kurtz 70 and his wife were out shopping when the sleet began
we hit the parking lot with clear windows and by the time we came out 25 minutes later every window was coated with ice kurtz said
temperatures in the 40s were forecast for super bowl sunday in atlanta
until it does melt off we are begging people to stay off the roads said ken davis of the georgia emergency management agency we are doing everything we can to get things in order for the game but mother nature may not cooperate
when a federal judge last week ordered tougher limits on the release of information about sex offenders advocates of megan's law were not surprised
maureen kanka mother of the slain girl for whom megan's law is named said she even supports aspects of the ruling condemning leaks of the information intended to be delivered door-to-door to carefully proscribed neighborhoods
even so kanka said she wants new jersey to get to work on a tougher law that includes internet web site listings of all sex offenders for all parents to see
currently megan's law provides for door-to-door notification when the highest risk offenders move in or get out of prison when offenders are deemed to pose a moderate risk only officials at schools daycare centers and facilities with custody of children receive the notification
kanka's daughter 7-year-old megan was killed in 1994 by a convicted sex offender who lived across the street but whose criminal past was a secret to his hamilton township neighbors this triggered a spate of megan's laws in legislatures across the united states and in congress
us district judge joseph irenas cited the case of a sex offender notification document that was leaked to a middlesex county newspaper that published the details including a map of where the offender lived
the judge also cited the case of a school principal who received a sex-offender notification at home photocopied it and distributed it at her school which was outside the zone of notification
less dramatic cases involve teachers sending sex offender notices home with the children or stacks of notices being left at the office of a daycare center for all to take - including parents picking up children
irenas said a system of distributing this information with zero leakage to unauthorized persons is in reality unattainable
however the mandate for the attorney general is not to devise a perfect system but one calculated to achieve the goals of the statute without unreasonably impinging on the nontrivial privacy interests of the plaintiffs the record before me shows that the current system fails to meet this standard
irenas attached to his ruling an order to have all sex offender notifications stopped if attorney general john farmer does not appeal or if the federal appeals court agrees farmer's spokesman roger shatzkin said no decision had been made by friday on how to proceed
ed barocas one of the chief lawyers for sex offender cases in the public defenders office has argued that these sorts of problems mean megan's law cannot function within the confines of the us constitution
state and federal courts have required limits because a convicted felon who is out of prison is entitled to some degree of the privacy all other citizens enjoy in their homes
kanka said she had anticipated such problems and is confident they can be addressed so is victim's advocate james o'brien director of the victims of violent crime compensation board
o'brien and kanka served on a 1995 task force that developed guidelines for megan's law both said once the area of a neighborhood to be notified about the presence of a sex offender has been defined the delivery of these notices must be careful it is not supposed to be splashed all over schools supermarket bulletin boards or the front pages of local newspapers they said
i think the judge's opinion is excellent to that extent o'brien said that was something that our panel didn't want either i don't think we paid less attention to the uniformity than we needed to but it is just a case when you have 21 different departments operating under certain guidelines you are going to have some diversity to it
morris county prosecutor john dangler head of the association representing all prosecutors said sex offender notifications are difficult to control but added it can be done with sufficient public education
the court recognized the problem how do you disseminate information to the public that is supposed to be kept private one doesn't go with the other dangler said
dangler said every agency he knows is enforcing the limits as vigorously as they can
but it is a very different matter for me as a prosecutor or anyone else to keep you from after work going out for a few drinks or going home or whatever and saying to someone hey you know that guy at the corner
vice president al gore retracted his 13-year-old statement equating abortion to the taking of a human life as he scrambled saturday to keep the issue a traditional stumbling block for republicans from tripping him up against democrat bill bradley
yes my position has changed gore said i strongly support a woman's right to choose and if bradley disputes that then he is making a mistake
bradley began airing a new television ad in the state saturday in which the former new jersey senator calls himself the only presidential candidate who has been pro-choice for everyone all the time
campaigning in manchester bradley said i was pro-choice from the day i entered politics it's not an issue you can dance around 
the topic clearly was on gore's mind as he answered reporters' questions about his own congressional record while strolling through milford's snowy town square
gore who represented tennessee in the house from 1977-85 and the senate from 1985-93 was asked if he still believes as he wrote a constituent in 1987 that abortion is the taking of a human life
he was quick to note he had qualified that statement i didn't write that i didn't i used the word arguably and yes my position has changed i would not use that phrasing today
gore said the only abortion matter with which he had wrestled in the past was whether public money should help pay for abortions for poor women - the medicaid funding for abortions he says he now supports
i've always supported keeping abortion legal and i've always been attacked by the anti-choice groups for that position since the beginning of my career gore said
in fact the national right to life committee gave gore an 84 percent approval rating for anti-abortion votes he cast while in the house
by contrast the national abortion and reproductive rights action league rated gore's house career decidedly anti-choice
among the 30 votes the group scored against gore was his yea in 1984 to define the word person under four existing civil rights laws to include unborn children from the moment of conception the organization characterized that as a move toward an all out prohibition on abortion
nancy greaney a gore supporter and former teacher from bedford was surprised to learn of gore's past votes but said i'd never hold them against him
i think people's opinions and beliefs evolve greaney said
ellie bofman an undecided democrat who shook hands with gore in the milford square saturday was conflicted about reports of gore's abortion record
i don't think its a crime to change your mind but i wish more politicians would admit they changed their mind the retired teacher said
whatever the case bofman added bradley demeaned gores character by implying he lied
bradley had cornered gore in debate on wednesday pressing him to concede his inconsistency on abortion rights in the days since the vice president has faced more questions about his record
bradley orchestrated the debate question and follow-up tv commercial in a drive to undercut gore's support among women and reverse his own slip in polls in time for tuesday's first-in-the-nation primary
a front page article friday in the boston globe the newspaper with the biggest new hampshire circulation questioned the veracity of gore's statement in debate that he had always been for a woman's right to choose asked friday afternoon about the morning paper's story gore a former journalist and avid news reader said he had not seen it
a woman caller to new hampshire public radio the same day told gore on-air i understand if you've changed your position in your career but i don't know how i can support your candidacy if you're dishonest about such an important subject and especially on national television
the gore campaign responded by producing a testimonial from feminist gloria steinem and signatures from 42 members of congress in an open letter stating what gore once had counted on being obvious in this election al gore is pro-choice
that letter was e-mailed to hundreds of political reporters and passed around a state democratic party dinner friday night it was followed by a list of 300 new hampshire women pledging their support for gore in part because of his commitment to women's health and abortion rights
gore spokesman chris lehane called the sudden flurry of paper an effort to help the press and said gore would continue to focus on issues such as medicaid medicare and education where he differs widely with bradley
republican george w bush who would be president campaigned for the first time saturday alongside his father who once was as the field of white house hopefuls plowed toward this week's leadoff new hampshire primary bill bradley charged al gore was trying to dance around earlier qualms about abortion as he bid to cut into the vice president's core democratic support
with the polls pointing to a tight finish at least on the republican side sen john mccain mocked bush's endgame strategy as quick get me another endorsement from the gop establishment people lining up behind the front-runner now are the same ones running our party in 1996 and 1998 when we lost elections said the arizona senator who has come from far back in the pack to within striking distance of victory in the state
gore who has moved past bradley in recent polls sought to blunt his rival's attack on his position on abortion and his credibility asked whether he would call abortion arguably the taking of human life as he wrote to a constituent 1987 the vice president said i would not use that phrasing today
he quickly added though that on the narrow question i've always supported roe v wade i've always supported keeping abortion legal
steve forbes who finished a strong second in last week's iowa caucuses alan keyes and gary bauer all made their rounds on the campaign's final weekend hoping for surprises in tuesday's vote that would catapult them into the thick of the gop race forbes released new radio commercials attacking bush for failing to be a firm enough foe of abortion and for overseeing a big increase in spending in texas
the crowds were bigger saturday the political theater more entertaining as new hampshire voters prepared to render their verdict a man stood on a manchester street corner wearing a bill clinton mask and waving a bush placard his presence on a wind-whipped day underscored that this begins the flood of primaries that will lead to election of the current president's successor
still after months of campaigning and thousands of candidate speeches not everyone was ready to declare a preference i'm slow to make my decision said robi jackson 57 of portsmouth who described herself as leaning toward bush my feeling is they all have wonderful ideas but when you get to washington well you know what they say talk is cheap'
a bush victory tuesday would cement his credentials as front-runner and damage if not cripple mccain's ability to sustain his challenge the texas governor began his day in portsmouth where he appeared before one of the largest crowds he's seen thus far an estimated 1000 people
from there he went to milford where he posed for a bush family political appearance father george bush mother barbara and other family members flanked him joined as well by elizabeth dole the wife of the 1996 presidential nominee and herself a campaign dropout this time around
this boy this son of ours is not going to let you down promised the former president - who ran three times in the new hampshire primary and won twice he's going to go all the way
when i heard my family was coming up here to knock on doors it gave me that extra impetus to keep charging in new hampshire said his son
aboard mccain's campaign bus the candidate said the gop establishment has become more and more alarmed at the possibility of his victory we've interfered with a coronation
in the democratic race bradley unveiled a new television ad that said of abortion this is the kind of issue that you can't straddle campaigning during the day the former new jersey senator said i was pro-choice from the day i entered politics and i will always be pro-choice it's not an issue you can dance around
gore said in campaign debate last week that he had once opposed federal funding for abortions under medicaid but had otherwise always been for abortion rights
yes my position has changed gore said i strongly support a woman's right to choose and if bradley disputes that then he is making a mistake
bauer plunged into the democratic dispute questioning gore's candor
i almost fell off my chair when i saw al gore deny that he had ever been pro-life he said
when it comes to an issue this profound a politician that plays games on something involving life and death i think loses all credibility to aspire to the white house he said
keyes said he doesn't plan any abrupt change in strategy in the final days of a race that looks bleak for him i think one of the things most important for us is to walk the walk with integrity it's dictated by the fact that i think this is what the country needs he said
un secretary general kofi annan praised russia's acting president vladimir putin on saturday as businesslike and decisive despite their differences over moscow's war in chechnya
putin came across as someone who had facts who was businesslike and decisive and had a sense of where he wants to go annan said saturday in this dynamic and fast-changing world these qualities are very useful in his dealings with other leaders around the world
the two met friday for a few hours and spoke about the chechnya campaign which putin has spearheaded
on saturday annan held talks with foreign minister igor ivanov and russian orthodox patriarch alexy ii before leaving for new york
annan said the visit helped him understand the magnitude of the chechnya problem though he still wants to see negotiations and an end to the war
no one can support or encourage terrorism he said saturday according to the itar-tass news agency but the means we use should be proportional and appropriate and all measures should be taken to ensure that civilians do not get caught in the middle
international leaders have accused russia of using indiscriminate force in chechnya citing high civilian casualties and the 250000 refugees russia insists it is targeting only rebel positions and says the offensive is aimed at rooting out chechen militants blamed for terrorist acts in russia

a jury has found an essex county man guilty of a murder-for-hire plot in which his wife died of drowning after water was forced down her throat in the couple's lake placid home
saturday afternoon's verdict means jeffrey glanda 49 could face the death penalty or life in prison for first-degree murder the jury began deliberations friday afternoon after a 14-day trial filled with testimony of a marriage torn apart and grisly details of the beating that led to the death of jeannine glanda
the body of 39-year-old jeannine glanda was discovered in august 1997 in a ford explorer that was partially submerged in a nearby lake according to testimony glanda offered his landscaper a long-time friend named nicholas pecararo $15000 a new pickup truck and a snowmobile to help commit the murder
in his closing argument friday lead defense counsel dennis schlenker attacked the testimony of pecararo and julius elmore - the prosecutions star witnesses - calling them the most despicable human beings he ever met according to the plattsburgh press-republican
pecararo said he was 15 years old when he met the defendant and did landscaping work around glanda's home pecararo testified that he and glanda attacked and killed mrs glanda but the defense tried to argue that pecararo committed the murder and lied to skirt the death penalty saying that someone else killed the woman
district attorney ronald briggs in closing arguments friday described the breakdown of the glandas' relationship in 1994 their separation and how mr glanda offered plattsburgh auto mechanic donald hilborn $10000 in 1996 to kill mrs glanda
briggs then fast-forwarded to 1997 citing pecararo's testimony
pecararo testified that after glanda attacked his wife in her home he shocked her with a stun gun while pecararo held her
glanda then beat her and poured large amounts of water down her throat until she died authorities said glanda ordered pecararo to have sex with her but he refused pecararo said
glanda is a court reporter who knows about dna evidence and was trying to frame pecararo briggs said dna evidence from sexual contact could identify the attacker
pecararo said he took the body to upper cascade lake in keene and dumped it and her ford explorer into the lake
kimberly musgrove testified she heard the splash when the explorer hit and kevin reynolds said he found mrs glanda's purse and some personal belongings on route 73 near where her body was found
the medical examiner couldn't estimate the moment of death but ruled that she died by being strangled and having water poured down her throat
briggs said pecararo testified because he felt guilty
the defendant could control nicholas pecararo's actions but could not control his soul briggs told the jury
briggs argued that glanda told hilborn and pecararo the same thing specifically that he wanted mrs glanda dead and it had to look like an accident to collect on the insurance money
glanda had taken out three insurance policies on his wife the last one 18 days before her death according to testimony the husband would have received $130000 through the policies
money is the oldest motive in the world briggs said
thursday state supreme court justice g thomas moynihan instructed the jury to ignore testimony from mrs glanda's divorce attorney william cantwell he had said he was working on custody papers for mrs glanda four weeks before his client's death
glanda faces the death penalty or life without parole when he is sentenced
a college librarian held in china for nearly six months on charges of smuggling state secrets returned to the united states on saturday
during the past 30 years i never cried but last night i cried all night said song yongyi looking tired but smiling broadly as he arrived at philadelphia international airport
song was detained in august and later charged under china's vague secrets law he had been collecting newspapers and documents concerning the cultural revolution the period from 1966 to 1976 when mao tse-tung unleashed a wave of violence against opponents and a million people were killed
song who is from shanghai spent five years in prison during that time accused of being a counterrevolutionary
he moved to the united states in 1989 earned master's degrees in chinese literature and library science and has worked at dickinson college since 1997 he has written articles and a book in chinese on the cultural revolution
song received the unexpected news that he was being released on friday
i am feeling very tired because during the last 36 hours i never got sleep song said before heading home to carlisle 110 miles west of philadelphia
he praised his wife helen yao for helping organize a campaign among academics for his release more than 100 china scholars in the united states and elsewhere petitioned chinese president jiang zemin saying song was engaged in normal academic work not espionage
though song said the items he collected had all been published he was accused by the chinese foreign ministry of purchasing or illegally supplying intelligence to people outside china
china's ambassador to the united states li zhao xing said friday that song was released as a show of leniency after he admitted all the facts related to his criminal activities and also voluntarily revealed evidence against illegal activities of others
song said he admitted nothing
in china we have a saying that the small officer gives small lie bigger officer gives bigger lie and the state department gives the biggest lie in my case it's exactly true he said
he said he was tormented but not physically abused during his detention
they didn't touch me physically but i should say they mentally touched me it is very ruthless song said for instance they not only arrested me at the same time they arrested my wife my wife knows nothing about my project she is an artist
yao had been detained with her husband on aug 7 but was released in november
every time they question me they always say your wife said such and such your wife identified such song said so i take them seriously i say i believe this is not true bring my wife in' then they suddenly say ok we'll move to the next topic
song who suffers from colon cancer said the chinese denied his requests to see a doctor he planned to arrange a physical examination on his return home
sen arlen specter r-penn who has introduced a bill to grant song us citizenship said he thought the release was an effort to smooth us-chinese relations china would like congress to stop reviewing its low-tariff trading privileges annually and grant the rights permanently as part of a deal to join the world trade organization
china's record has not been good on human rights specter said if china wants to be a respected member of the community of nations they have to respect human rights
about 200 chanting flag-waving protesters marched in front of ins headquarters saturday demanding that 6-year-old elian gonzalez be sent home to his father in cuba
but rep dan burton whose congressional maneuvering to keep elian in the united states has infuriated the boy's father said saturday that the 6-year-old told him he doesn't want to go back
he's a very intelligent young man and i was able to ask him without any coaching a couple of questions the indiana republican said after meeting for 30 minutes with elian at the home where the boy is staying with relatives
the first question i asked him is how did he like living here and he said he liked it very much as he was blowing bubbles and then i said would you like to go back to cuba' and he was very firm in saying no and this without any coaching
elian has been the subject of heated debate since he was found clinging to an inner tube nov 25 off the florida coast his mother and 10 others traveling with him drowned during an effort to leave cuba
elian's grandmothers were expected to continue a tour of the united states where they have been campaigning for elian's return cuba's prensa latina news agency said
in miami the protesters at the immigration and naturalization service office yelled send elian home as a small plane towing a banner with the same slogan passed overhead
cuban-americans among the group said they wanted to show that not all cuban-americans want elian to remain here they said the 6-year-old had been kidnapped and should be returned to his father
every child needs a father and a mother said juan morales a cuban who has lived in the united states for eight years if the mother dies the person directly responsible is the father and not the uncle and not the united states
andres gomez national coordinator of the antonio maceo brigade a group that organized the protest and advocates normalizing relations with cuba said the demonstrators have a noble purpose
we are coming together in this case in defense of the most fundamental rights of a human being which are the rights of a child he said
later saturday the anti-castro democracy movement a group which wants elian to stay put launched a flotilla of about 20 boats to pay tribute to elian's mother and the 10 others who drowned about 300 people including about 200 aboard boats took part
demonstrators released balloons into the air and threw flowers into the water as the american and cuban national anthems played donato dalrymple a fisherman who found elian floating at sea tossed a wreath with flowers arranged in the pattern of the cuban flag into the water
today we're here to remember the mother of elian gonzalez elisabeth brotons and the other people who drowned in the unfortunate tragedy said ramon saul sanchez the leader of the democracy movement
the ins has ruled elian should return to his father but its order has not been carried out because the government agreed to hold off until a federal court considers a challenge filed by the miami relatives
us district judge william hoeveler originally said he would hear arguments march 6 on whether the relative's lawsuit should be dismissed but on friday he moved that day up to feb 22
in an attempt to block elian's return to cuba burton earlier this month subpoenaed the boy to appear before the house government reform committee which he chairs
at the time elian's father expressed outrage what right does that man have juan miguel gonzalez said who is he he is no one i am the father
burton said it is unlikely that elian will actually appear before the committee but he didn't rule that out entirely
the justice department asserts that if elian is not returned to cuba it could hurt attempts to retrieve american children taken out of the country by a foreign-born parent against the wishes of the child's american parent
burton said the situations are not identical
we are talking about people who are leaving a totalitarian communist state he said
dozens of people demonstrated saturday outside dover air force base where a pilot who has refused to take a mandatory series of injections against anthrax faces a possible court-martial
maj sonnie bates 35 is believed to be the highest-ranking officer in the air force to face the possibility of a court-martial for refusing to take the vaccine
the military has ordered all of its 24 million reserve and active-duty soldiers sailors and airmen to be inoculated as a defense against biological warfare several have been prosecuted for refusing the shots which the military says are safe
protesters carried signs which read free major bates and my husband will take a bullet for america but not the anthrax vaccine
the people who refuse this vaccine are being raped of the same civil rights they fight to protect said gloria webb of ellendale south of dover
louise rempfer of suffield conn said her husband once a national guard major and a pilot resigned his commission rather than take a vaccine he feels is unsafe
i am here in support of my husband and to show support for maj bates she said
the group of about 35 protesters including bates' wife roxane marched past the base's north gate which was closed as they passed
these people had a right to express themselves said base spokesman maj frank smolinsky freedom of speech is one of the things the military fights to protect
smolinsky said the policy of mandatory vaccinations would continue
we absolutely stand behind the vaccination procedure he said
after about 20 minutes the protesters were asked to clear the gate by military police
bates has said he won't take the injections because he believes the department of defense can't guarantee he won't become permanently disabled by sickness from the shots
an investigating officer is to hold a hearing this week at the base to determine whether bates should face a court-martial for disobeying an order
bates could face up to five years in a military prison the loss of his rank and the loss of the military pension he has worked to gather for the nearly 14 years he has served as a pilot
the international monetary fund will investigate new allegations of possible misuse of its funds in ukraine a top imf official said saturday
stanley fischer the imf's first deputy managing director said the fund's officials are confident that they have a clear picture of the current state of ukraine's finances but he said the organization will look into allegations that imf funds were misappropriated
on friday the financial times reported that former ukrainian prime minister pavlo lazarenko has offered to testify that ukraine's present government misappropriated millions of dollars in imf loans
we have no evidence that it happened fischer said saturday in davos where the world economic forum is being held
but we nonetheless had better check and we will do that
lazarenko who is wanted in switzerland on money laundering charges and is in custody in the united states has been in contact with several us lawmakers about the possibility of testifying before a house committee the newspaper said
lazarenko who led ukraine's government in 1996-97 is seeking political asylum in the united states
the imf and ukraine are negotiating a $25 billion loan program that was suspended last summer after the country failed to meet economic targets
in a separate development fischer shook hands with argentina's president fernando de la rua on a deal for a three-year $74 billion loan package for the south american country
there was agreement on the principles and details of the program with just a few technicalities left to sort out fischer said at an annual conference of political and business leaders in the alpine resort of davos
fischer said argentina's president had taken very impressive structural measures including labor market and social security reform
meanwhile european officials and economists at the gathering also discussed the weakness of europe's common currency the euro
french finance minister christian sautter said saturday that he hopes currency markets will soon take notice of economic recovery in the 11 countries that have switched to the euro
that performance isn't perceived sufficiently he said
a 32-year-old housewife became the first woman to file for divorce under a new law that makes it easier for egyptian women to leave their husbands
wafa mosaad gabr who had been trying to end her marriage for three years filed for divorce because she simply didn't want to live with her husband el-sayyed mohammed ibrahim a 38-year old farmer the woman's lawyer said the lawyer mostafa eid did not elaborate
the law which had faced strong opposition in male-dominated and overwhelmingly muslim egypt was passed by the country's people's assembly wednesday night and approved by president hosni mubarak on saturday
the new legislation makes it easier for women to obtain a divorce though the process remains more difficult for women than it is for men islamic law gives men the right to divorce their wives anytime and without the approval of a court or any other authority
under the old law women had to prove that physical or psychological harm was caused by husbands to obtain a divorce
now women must only declare before a court that they want a divorce judges will give the couple three months to try and reconcile and six months if they have children an immediate divorce will be granted at the end of the trial period if they don't change their minds
under the new law women who divorce their husbands must return their dowries and relinquish all financial claims including alimony
gabr who got married in 1986 had previously asked her husband to divorce her eid said
if gabr gets her divorce she will return the equivalent of $30 which her husband paid as a dowry but for her three children she would still get child support payments which are not affected under the new law
the first hearing in the case is set for march 14
another federal judge has ruled that the immigration and naturalization service cannot indefinitely hold immigrants who have been ordered deported for crimes but whose native countries refuse to accept them
us district judge terry j hatter's ruling affects 130 legal immigrants being held at detention centers in central california who already have served prison time for their crimes
hatter said the policy violates the immigrants' rights to due process concluding that they pose a flight risk or danger is not sufficient reason to detain them for what amounts to the rest of their lives he said
the 9th us circuit court of appeals has agreed to review a similar ruling by a federal judge in seattle that case is scheduled to be argued next month but a decision likely is several months away
nationwide the ins holds about 3800 people in indefinite custody for crimes ranging from petty theft to murder
the practice has been upheld by federal judges in san diego and nevada and by federal appeals courts in new orleans and philadelphia
hatter's ruling thursday was hailed by civil liberties groups that have criticized the ins policy
this is a resounding rejection of the immigration and naturalization service argument that they can hold someone forever said lucas guttentag director of the american civil liberties union's immigrants' rights project
the court recognized that the purpose of immigration detention is to effectuate deportation not to sentence someone to life in prison guttentag said

burton said it is unlikely that elian will actually appear before the committee but he didn't rule that out entirely

israeli prime minister ehud barak and palestinian leader yasser arafat will meet this week amid fading hopes for concluding the outline of a peace agreement by the deadline they set feb 13
if they don't meet it they'll reach some understanding about how to deal with that problem a senior us official said saturday after a 30-minute meeting between arafat and president clinton
the statement was the frankest admission yet that american mediators are likely to fall short of their target for a basic understanding about the future of jerusalem whether there will be a palestinian state and other knotty issues at the core of the arab-israeli dispute
the barak-arafat meeting will be held thursday or friday at erez a border crossing between israel and palestinian-held gaza and will focus on the major unresolved issues said the official who briefed reporters on condition of anonymity
he described the pursuit of the deadline as a formidable challenge it's very difficult to get there the official said
there were no american claims of progress after clinton saw arafat in the steigenberger hotel belvedere in this swiss ski resort they were among scores of world leaders attending an international economic forum
it was their second meeting in nine days nor was progress claimed after the last one at the white house in washington
the state department announced thursday that senior us mediator dennis ross would go to the middle east to help in the search for a settlement ross is due in israel on wednesday
lower-ranking israeli and palestinian negotiators are to hold intensive talks early this week at israel's red sea resort eilat
clinton has appealed to the two sides to seek less than 100 percent of their demands he said a settlement requires as much
secretary of state madeleine albright in her own flurry of diplomacy in davos saw king abdullah of jordan for 45 minutes saturday night and was to confer with arafat and egyptian foreign minister amr moussa on sunday
she then travels to moscow where she has separate meetings scheduled monday with foreign ministers david levy of israel and prince saud of saudi arabia they will be in moscow for a multilateral conference to promote understanding between the jewish state and its arab neighbors
in his meeting with albright jordan's king abdullah volunteered to have his kingdom act as host for the next regional economic conference state department spokesman james p rubin said
rubin also confirmed that neither syria nor lebanon would attend the moscow conference syria's government-controlled press has criticized the conference as divisive to arab unity
clinton albright and ross all are prepared to commit themselves to working on a day-by-day basis to try to reach an israeli-palestinian settlement the us official said saturday
palestinian officials have raised the possibility of shifting negotiations to washington if talks in the region do not produce an accord
on friday the palestinians accused barak of not being serious about reaching the feb 13 deadline
nabil shaath the palestinian planning minister said his negotiating team proposed that the talks be conducted in washington under clinton's close supervision but israel rejected the idea
also salim zanoun chairman of the palestine liberation organization's decision-making central council said the council will meet wednesday in gaza city to set the date for the declaration of an independent palestinian state
it appeared highly unlikely however that the palestinians would issue a unilateral declaration of independence and risk angering the americans before the september deadline for a peace treaty with israel
a teen-age boy survived a 63-foot fall from his seventh-story apartment balcony after landing on two small plastic dumpsters police said saturday
the 17-year-old boy was hospitalized with a fractured leg and a mild concussion police and doctors said
the incident occurred late friday in thessaloniki a northern port city
we have learned that the young man had an argument with his mother who did not let him go out said the city's police chief yannis panagopoulos he apparently made a mock threat to jump off the balcony he slipped fell and landed on the plastic garbage containers
a knitting mill that has been making clothing since the late 1800s is going out of business and company officials blame foreign trade policies
the johnstown knitting mill co which traces it roots to 1893 and employs 229 people will close by late march company officials announced friday
johnstown knit as it is locally known is an independent-line knitwear manufacturer
the business has been in the family of the current president thomas b easterly for five generations
the company attributes a majority of their loss to us foreign trade policies such as nafta which has encouraged many us companies to manufacture goods offshore this has made it next to impossible for most domestic manufacturers to compete in the marketplace company officials said in a news release
about 200 chanting flag-waving protesters marched in front of the immigration and naturalization service's office saturday demanding that 6-year-old elian gonzalez be sent home to his father in cuba
but rep dan burton whose congressional maneuvering to keep elian in the united states has infuriated the boy's father said saturday that the boy told him he doesn't want to go back
he's a very intelligent young man and i was able to ask him without any coaching a couple of questions the indiana republican said after meeting for 30 minutes with elian at the home where the boy is staying with relatives
the first question i asked him is how did he like living here and he said he liked it very much as he was blowing bubbles and then i said would you like to go back to cuba' and he was very firm in saying no and this without any coaching
elian has been the subject of heated debate since he was found clinging to an inner tube nov 25 off the florida coast his mother and 10 others traveling with him drowned during an effort to leave cuba
elian's grandmothers were expected to continue a tour of the united states where they have been campaigning for elian's return cuba's prensa latina news agency said
more than 100000 cubans gathered saturday in the cuban city of cienfuegos for another in an almost daily series of government-sponsored nationally televised rallies for elian's return one child speaker idolized the boy as a kidnapped angel
in miami the protesters at the ins office yelled send elian home as a small plane towing a banner with the same slogan passed overhead
cuban-americans among the group said they wanted to show that not all cuban-americans want elian to remain here they said the boy had been kidnapped and should be returned to his father
every child needs a father and a mother said juan morales a cuban who has lived in the united states for eight years if the mother dies the person directly responsible is the father and not the uncle and not the united states
andres gomez national coordinator of the antonio maceo brigade a group that organized the protest and advocates normalizing relations with cuba said the demonstrators have a noble purpose

vice president al gore retracted his 13-year-old statement equating abortion to the taking of a human life as he scrambled saturday to keep the issue a traditional stumbling block for republicans from tripping him up against democrat bill bradley
yes my position has changed gore said i strongly support a woman's right to choose and if bradley disputes that then he is making a mistake
bradley began airing a new television ad in the state saturday in which the former new jersey senator calls himself the only presidential candidate who has been pro-choice for everyone all the time
campaigning in manchester bradley said i was pro-choice from the day i entered politics it's not an issue you can dance around
to try and settle the bedrock question for many democratic women gore indulged several reporters' questions as coffee in hand he walked through milford's town square
gore who represented tennessee in the house from 1977-85 and the senate from 1985-93 was asked whether he still believes that abortion - in the questioner's words - is the taking of a human life
obviously prepared gore was quick to recall that he had qualified the statement at the time i didn't write that i didn't i used the word arguably and yes my position has changed gore acknowledged
indeed in a 1987 letter to a constitutent gore wrote that abortion is arguably the taking of a human life in any event gore added that he would not use that phrasing today
gore said the only abortion matter with which he had wrestled was whether public money should help pay for abortions for poor women - the medicaid funding for abortions he says he now supports
i've always supported keeping abortion legal and i've always been attacked by the anti-choice groups for that position since the beginning of my career gore said
in fact the national right to life committee gave gore an 84 percent approval rating for anti-abortion votes he cast while in the house
by contrast the national abortion and reproductive rights action league rated gore's house career decidedly anti-choice
among the 30 votes the group scored against gore was his yea in 1984 to define the word person under four existing civil rights laws to include unborn children from the moment of conception the organization characterized that as a move toward an all out prohibition on abortion
nancy greaney a gore supporter and former teacher from bedford was surprised to learn of gore's record but said i'd never hold it against him
i think people's opinions and beliefs evolve greaney said
ellie bosman an undecided democrat who shook hands with gore in the milford square saturday was conflicted about reports of gore's abortion record
i don't think it's a crime to change your mind but i wish more politicians would admit they changed their minds the retired teacher said
whatever the case bosman added bradley demeaned gores character by implying he lied
bradley had cornered gore in debate on wednesday pressing him to concede his inconsistency on abortion rights in the days since the vice president has faced more questions about his record
bradley orchestrated the debate question and follow-up tv commercial in a drive to undercut gore's support among women and reverse his own slip in polls in time for tuesday's first-in-the-nation primary
a front page article friday in the boston globe which has a large circulation in new hampshire questioned the veracity of gore's statement in debate that he had always been for a woman's right to choose asked friday afternoon about the morning paper's story gore a former journalist and avid news reader said he had not seen it
a woman caller to new hampshire public radio the same day told gore on-air i understand if you've changed your position in your career but i don't know how i can support your candidacy if you're dishonest about such an important subject and especially on national television
the gore campaign responded by producing a testimonial from feminist gloria steinem and signatures from 42 members of congress in an open letter stating what gore once had counted on being obvious in this election al gore is pro-choice
that letter was e-mailed to hundreds of political reporters and passed around a state democratic party dinner friday night it was followed by a list of 300 new hampshire women pledging their support for gore in part because of his commitment to women's health and abortion rights
gore spokesman chris lehane called the sudden flurry of paper an effort to help the press and said gore would continue to focus on issues such as medicaid medicare and education where he differs widely with bradley
rep jerry nadler d-ny and other bradley backers stood outside gore's town meeting in lebanon to distribute a 1984 letter in which gore wrote it is my deep personal conviction that abortion is wrong innocent human life must be protected
said nadler he wrote this and voted to civil rights protection to the fetus so if he says he was always pro-choice he's wrong
inside gore told his audience of mostly undecided voters that bradley has sought in recent days to manufacture some differences on issues where there really are no differences of the 13 questions he fielded from voters none was about abortion
republican george w bush who would be president campaigned for the first time saturday alongside his father who once was as the field of white house hopefuls plowed toward this week's leadoff new hampshire primary bill bradley charged al gore was trying to dance around earlier qualms about abortion as he bid to cut into the vice president's core democratic support
with the polls pointing to a tight finish at least on the republican side sen john mccain mocked bush's endgame strategy as quick get me another endorsement from the gop establishment people lining up behind the front-runner now are the same ones running our party in 1996 and 1998 when we lost elections said the arizona senator who has come from far back in the pack to within striking distance of victory in the state
gore who has moved past bradley in recent polls sought to blunt his rival's attack on his position on abortion and his credibility asked whether he would say abortion is arguably the taking of a human life as he wrote to a constituent 1987 the vice president said i would not use that phrasing today
he quickly added though that on the narrow question i've always supported roe v wade i've always supported keeping abortion legal
steve forbes who finished a strong second in last week's iowa caucuses alan keyes and gary bauer all made their rounds on the campaign's final weekend hoping for surprises in tuesday's vote that would catapult them into the thick of the gop race forbes released new radio commercials attacking bush for failing to be a firm enough foe of abortion and for overseeing a big increase in spending in texas
the crowds were bigger saturday the political theater more entertaining as new hampshire voters prepared to render their verdict a man stood on a manchester street corner wearing a bill clinton mask and waving a bush placard his presence on a wind-whipped day underscored that this begins the flood of primaries that will lead to election of the current president's successor
still after months of campaigning and thousands of candidate speeches not everyone was ready to declare a preference i'm slow to make my decision said robi jackson 57 of portsmouth who described herself as leaning toward bush my feeling is they all have wonderful ideas but when you get to washington well you know what they say talk is cheap'
a bush victory tuesday would cement his credentials as front-runner and damage if not cripple mccain's ability to sustain his challenge the texas governor began his day in portsmouth where he appeared before one of the largest crowds he's seen thus far an estimated 1000 people
from there he went to milford where he posed for a bush family political appearance father george bush mother barbara and other family members flanked him joined as well by elizabeth dole the wife of the 1996 presidential nominee and herself a campaign dropout this time around
this boy this son of ours is not going to let you down promised the former president - who ran three times in the new hampshire primary and won twice he's going to go all the way
when i heard my family was coming up here to knock on doors it gave me that extra impetus to keep charging in new hampshire said his son
aboard mccain's campaign bus the candidate said the gop establishment has become more and more alarmed at the possibility of his victory we've interfered with a coronation
in the democratic race bradley unveiled a new television ad that said of abortion this is the kind of issue that you can't straddle campaigning during the day the former new jersey senator said i was pro-choice from the day i entered politics and i will always be pro-choice it's not an issue you can dance around
gore said in campaign debate last week that he had once opposed federal funding for abortions under medicaid but had otherwise always been for abortion rights
yes my position has changed gore said i strongly support a woman's right to choose and if bradley disputes that then he is making a mistake
bauer plunged into the democratic dispute questioning gore's candor
i almost fell off my chair when i saw al gore deny that he had ever been pro-life he said
when it comes to an issue this profound a politician that plays games on something involving life and death i think loses all credibility to aspire to the white house he said
keyes said he doesn't plan any abrupt change in strategy in the final days of a race that looks bleak for him i think one of the things most important for us is to walk the walk with integrity it's dictated by the fact that i think this is what the country needs he said
two people died early saturday morning in a house fire as firefighters desperately tried to reach them seven others inside the burning home were able to escape officials said
fire officials said the blaze appears to have started accidentally
the fire at 707 w 4th st began shortly before 5 am
deputy fire chief paul newborn said a man and a woman in their 20s or 30s appeared to have been living in the basement of the 2 1/2-story home their names were not released pending family notification
no other injuries were reported
the fire was under control around 10 am newborn said
newborn said there were smoke detectors upstairs which had alerted the residents
officials from the union county arson task force focused their attention primarily on the basement where the two had perished
we're calling the fire accidental from a heat source said newborn who would not say whether a space heater had caused the fire
we had some reports of space heaters downstairs said newborn but we're pretty sure at this point that the fire started in the basement however it remains under further investigation
timothy jack 32 has lived on w 4th st for 15 years and said keeping warm during the colder months has always been a problem for people living in these multiple-family homes
like everyone else around here you leave your oven on to keep warm he said i mean look at these old houses with these old windows that's the only way you can keep warm
newborn said there was no stove in the basement living area
the owner of the building was at the scene several hours after the fire had been declared under control but he refused to speak to reporters
departments from several neighboring departments were also called to help battle the blaze
the seven survivors had been placed temporarily in a nearby hotel off route 22 officials said their names had not been released
more than 1000 anti-free trade activists defied a protest ban saturday and staged a hectic demonstration at a gathering of the world's political and corporate elite in this secluded alpine resort
some of the protesters - including environmentalists and anarchists - broke windows at a mcdonald's restaurant and vandalized several cars others burned an american flag they had pulled down from the facade of a luxury hotel where most of the world leaders are staying and used police barricades to try to break the hotel's windows
but at least davos didn't become a second seattle said local government president peter aliesch in reference to the riots during december's world trade organization meeting
two police officers were injured though not seriously officials said
the protests took place outside the site where president clinton delivered a speech to the gathered leaders
after several hours and under increasingly heavy snow the protesters dispersed with the cry we'll be back and some of them singing the communist anthem the internationale
swiss president adolf ogi criticized the skirmishes
the use of force is extremely regrettable he told journalists the world economic forum which organizes the davos meeting deplored that a limited number of demonstrators chose violence over dialogue
police - although equipped with full riot gear - kept a deliberately nonconfrontational approach even when under assault from snowballs blocks of ice ski sticks and other makeshift weapons only two people were arrested
despite having declared a ban on all protests during clinton's visit and calling out troops for extra backup authorities made no attempt to stop the first demonstrators as they entered the long narrow main street through the village but they then seemed to be taken by surprise as an estimated 1300 protesters pushed through control barriers
firing warning shots security forces retreated to less than 500 yards from the conference center and hotel hosting clinton they then barricaded off the street with land cruisers equipped with huge metal grids to prevent further disruption clinton was in the hotel at the time conducting business
yankee clinton go home read one typical banner don't let the multinationals destroy the people resist read another
the new spirit of davos resistance against international exploitation declared another banner in reference to the conference organizers' oft-repeated claims that it is the spirit of davos that attracts hundreds of global political and business leaders each year
the critics say they have the same concerns about the world economic forum as about the world trade organization that it is undemocratic secretive and only concerned with maximizing commercial profits they say that vital deals and decisions are struck behind closed doors with little consideration shown to public concerns for example on genetically modified foods
radical french farmers' unions which have campaigned against mcdonald's in france and the globalization it represents and which were out in force in seattle were among the protesters
our concerns need to be more represented in everyday public opinion said alain pulles one of the farmers
many of the demonstrators were clad in ski gear to escape official attention others were masked and belonged to anarchist groups
an ap photographer was roughed up as he took a picture of a demonstrator felling a police officer with a cross country ski
norfolk southern corp is laying off 550 union workers blaming falling revenue high diesel prices and a weak export coal market
company officials confirmed the layoffs friday just two days after norfolk southern announced an early retirement program for 1200 nonunion employees the company has about 35000 employees
the layoffs set to take effect next friday affect track and machine workers who belong to the brotherhood of maintenance of way and are scattered across the norfolk-based railroad's 12 divisions in 22 states mostly east of the mississippi river
diesel prices coupled with problems associated with the company's takeover of conrail last year caused norfolk southern's fourth-quarter profits to plunge 81 percent to $31 million or 8 cents a share
spokeswoman susan bland said the layoffs had more to do with business conditions including a decline in the export coal market to asia
she said more layoffs could follow
hundreds of disgruntled westerners paraded through town with 10000 shovels saturday to protest federal environmental policy and lend support to residents feuding with the us forest service over a washed-out road
the residents want to rebuild a dirt road along the jarbidge river in the humboldt-toiyabe national forest but the forest service has fought their efforts saying the erosion would harm the river's bull trout population
we have learned we must stand together shoulder to shoulder to defeat those who would destroy our way of life and the west as we know it state assemblyman john carpenter a republican from elko said during saturday's rally
two hundred horse-drawn wagons makeshift floats atvs motorcycles snowmobiles and pickup trucks loaded with tons of shovels donated from across the west paraded down elko's main street to a rally at the county courthouse
more than 3000 people lined the streets with shovels and american flags and children waved plastic sandbox shovels several protesters carried signs that read stop clinton's war on the west
it has taken on a life of its own said oq chris johnson a local businessman who helped organize the jarbidge shovel brigade parade it's bigger than the fourth of july
most of the shovels were delivered in a caravan from montana where loggers and mill workers long have been at odds with the forest service
somehow sending a shovel seems symbolic maybe it will make a difference said cary hegreberg of helena mont executive vice president of the montana wood products association
most people understand shovels are a symbol of work that's something we have in common - we want to work he said
elko county commissioner mike nannini who helped organize the parade said shovels arrived by mail from as far away as rhode island and maryland
it's just a grassroots deal it's not just the west anymore these people are saying no more' he said
the jarbidge river in a remote canyon near the idaho border is home of the southernmost population of bull trout in north america
the disputed road a 15 mile dirt stretch connects to a trailhead for a wilderness path and provides vehicle access to fishing and camping along the river
the elko county commission claims the forest service has no jurisdiction over the south canyon road because the road was there before the humboldt national forest was established in the early 1900s
johnson and others threatened to rebuild the road by hand but a federal judge in reno issued a court order banning any work on the road in november
the controversy has prompted a congressional field hearing and has become a lightning rod for criticism of president clinton's proposal to protect millions of acres of roadless areas in national forests
nevada gov kenny guinn a republican offered his support for the protest in a letter to organizers on friday
since the vast majority of the public lands are in the west perhaps the bureaucrats in washington dc simply don't understand the impact their decisions have on our western way of life guinn said
one of the protesters was bob secrist of elko
i'm in the firewood business and the forest service is giving me a bad time they are supposed to manage the forest but they are just shutting it down and locking it up he said
the president wants to make everything roadless that's fine for the people in kansas but 85 percent of our land is controlled by the government in nevada we're expected to make a living on the other 15 percent he said
the first american trade show in communist cuba in four decades wrapped on saturday with organizers saying that several manufacturers of us medical products expected to make sales to government hospitals and clinics in coming months
it went exceedingly well - much better than expected said peter w nathan president of pwn exhibicion llc of westport conn as exhibitors packed up x-ray machines and other hospital equipment in cardboard boxes
several of the 97 american companies that participated are expected to apply for licenses from the us treasury department to sell products to cuban medical institutions nathan said he did not provide specifics
whether the money to buy is there remains to be seen but there is interest said nathan
the us healthcare exhibition is the latest small advance in us-cuban relations since january 1999 when president clinton changed rules to allow increased contact between americans and cubans and to ease sales of medical goods
almost a decade after the collapse of its socialist partners in eastern europe the cuban government remains strapped for hard currency and often cannot come up with the cash needed to buy imported goods payments to us companies are complicated by the us trade embargo
but long-term contacts rather than sales were the goal with this first show nathan said
rules limiting us medical exports to cuba under decades-old trade sanctions were eased last year there have been several proposals to fully lift restrictions on food and medical sales but they have failed to gain full congressional approval
we found that they wanted a lot of information said denisse garcia latin american operations manager for datex-ohmedia which exhibited anesthesia machines and baby incubators
datex-ohmedia as many of the other exhibitors was donating some of its equipment to hospitals and clinics it was giving an incubator to the nonprofit roman catholic charity caritas and leaving an anesthesia machine for the government's medcuba agency
miguel angel campomanes director of latin american sales for zeiss optical devices said he had received enough interest to make as much as $1 million in sales if they have the money
the booth run by zeiss humphrey of dublin calif was among the most popular during the five-day show because of its free vision tests
archer daniels midland co of decatur ill the show's primary sponsor also attracted much attention for its vitamin e samples
other major exhibitors included eastman kodak co imaging devices eli lilly &amp co pharmaceuticals and gerber products co nutritional products for children
us officials say that since 1992 they have granted 40 to 50 licenses to american companies to sell medicines and medical supplies in cuba and that only a handful of requests have been turned down
the us government says it licensed $19 million worth of american medical sales to cuba in 1998 and $26 million worth in the first half of 1999
but actual sales have been much lower us officials say
the last such us trade gathering on the island is believed to have been a 1960 meeting for american travel agents
about 200 chanting flag-waving protesters marched in front of the immigration and naturalization service's office saturday demanding that 6-year-old elian gonzalez be sent home to his father in cuba
but rep dan burton whose congressional maneuvering to keep elian in the united states has infuriated the boy's father said saturday that the boy told him he doesn't want to go back
he's a very intelligent young man and i was able to ask him without any coaching a couple of questions the indiana republican said after meeting for 30 minutes with elian at the home where the boy is staying with relatives
the first question i asked him is how did he like living here and he said he liked it very much as he was blowing bubbles and then i said would you like to go back to cuba' and he was very firm in saying no and this without any coaching
elian has been the subject of heated debate since he was found clinging to an inner tube nov 25 off the florida coast his mother and 10 others traveling with him drowned during an effort to leave cuba
elian's grandmothers were expected to continue a tour of the united states where they have been campaigning for elian's return cuba's prensa latina news agency said
more than 100000 cubans gathered saturday in the cuban city of cienfuegos for another in an almost daily series of government-sponsored nationally televised rallies for elian's return one child speaker idolized the boy as a kidnapped angel
in ottawa about 30 protesters marched in front of the new us embassy carrying signs that read end the kidnapping and cuban children are not for sale in los angeles some three dozen demonstrators rallied in support of sending elian back
if that was an american boy over in cuba we would have the whole marine corps over there trying to get him back said rudy pisani 68 of los angeles
cuban-americans among the protesters at the ins office in miami said they wanted to show that not all cuban-americans want elian to remain here they said the boy had been kidnapped and should be returned to his father
every child needs a father and a mother said juan morales a cuban who has lived in the united states for eight years if the mother dies the person directly responsible is the father and not the uncle and not the united states
andres gomez national coordinator of the antonio maceo brigade a group that organized the protest and advocates normalizing relations with cuba said the demonstrators have a noble purpose
we are coming together in this case in defense of the most fundamental rights of a human being which are the rights of a child he said
later saturday the anti-castro democracy movement a group which wants elian to stay put launched a flotilla of about 20 boats to pay tribute to elian's mother and the 10 others who drowned about 300 people including about 200 aboard boats took part
demonstrators released balloons into the air and threw flowers into the water as the american and cuban national anthems played donato dalrymple a fisherman who found elian floating at sea tossed a wreath with flowers arranged in the pattern of the cuban flag into the water
today we're here to remember the mother of elian gonzalez elisabeth brotons and the other people who drowned in the unfortunate tragedy said ramon saul sanchez the leader of the democracy movement
the ins has ruled elian should return to his father but its order has not been carried out because the government agreed to hold off until a federal court considers a challenge filed by the miami relatives
us district judge william hoeveler originally said he would hear arguments march 6 on whether the relative's lawsuit should be dismissed but on friday he moved the hearing up to feb 22

robert shoaf knelt over one of the 10 craters now dotting his property and sighed in disbelief as he clasped a jagged strip of artillery shrapnel
one hundred yards that way it would have hit my house shoaf said saturday pointing west to the home he shares with his wife joan about 100 miles southwest of dallas
just days earlier shoaf and 11 other family members who live on the 300-acre cattle ranch were ducking for cover as army battalions eight miles away at fort hood launched a volley of 155 mm howitzer artillery shells toward their property
it roared like a whistle and then a bomb exploded the 70-year-old said i didn't know what it was until the next morning when we found the holes
a 4-foot length of the foundation of his home cracked and chunks of shrapnel lodged in the nearby home of his son jay
it was unreal like a war zone said jay shoaf's wife tammy
the force of wednesday night's blasts which continued for about an hour shook pictures off of walls broke a chandelier in the family room and cracked sections of dry wall
the shelling happened during a training exercise involving two artillery battalions said lt col maryane cummings a spokeswoman for fort hood
we're really concerned about safety so that is why we stopped all practice firing until we find out what happened she said
cummings said she would not speculate on what went wrong she said base officials are conducting an investigation
robert shoaf said army officials had been out to survey the damage on friday and were expected to return to meet with the family on tuesday his family wants some assurance that it won't happen again
we still live here said mrs shoaf they better check their instruments before they start up again

intensifying their pressure on republican gov george w bush civil rights leaders on saturday called for texans to purge confederate flags from public spaces in order to remove badges of slavery and racism
dozens of leaders from naacp branches in texas met saturday to discuss ways to combat racism kyev tatum of the hill country branch said he was frustrated with what he described as bush's unclear position on the flag
unfortunately many leaders within our state government have refused to take a stand tatum said we believe it is our duty and our responsibility to bring that to the attention of the people of texas and the country
in south carolina thousands of people have protested the confederate flag flying atop the statehouse there and urged the legislature to take it down the republican presidential candidates competing in that state's primary next month have sidestepped the issue saying it is an issue for south carolinians to solve the democratic candidates have said it should be removed
gary bledsoe president of the texas naacp has asked bush to support an effort to remove a plaque that includes a representation of the flag from the state supreme court building in austin
we need to remove all vestiges and badges of slavery and racism so african-americans can have the same rights and opportunities accorded to other citizens he said
when asked bush's position on the plaques bush spokesman scott mcclellan said saturday that representations of all six governments that once held authority in texas are present in the capitol mcclellan would not say whether bush wanted the plaques removed
tatum asked the state board of the naacp to endorse a protest in austin against the confederate flags and for stronger hate-crime laws
bledsoe said he supports the rally and wants to combine it with a protest of the state senate's decision to designate april as confederate history and heritage month a resolution was adopted by the senate last march
it slipped through the legislature bledsoe said even the black caucus members were completely unaware that it occurred
the resolution describes the civil war as a struggle for state's rights and individual freedom and says the defense of slavery was a factor for only 2 percent of texans who fought in the war
politically correct revisionists would have texas children believe that their confederate ancestors fought for slavery when in fact most texans joined the confederate armed forces to defend their homes their families and their proud heritage as texans the resolution reads
mcclellan said bush was asked to sign a proclamation in support of the resolution but declined bush did not comment when the senate approved the resolution he said

the founder of brazil's indian affairs bureau and a pioneer of indigenous rights said saturday that the government had fired him because it no longer wanted to pay his salary
orlando villas boas 86 said he was notified of his dismissal by fax he was semiretired and held a position with the agency that was mostly honorary
villas boas said it seemed the bureau had fired him to save his salary worth $730 a month the explanation from the bureau known as funai was that he wasn't entitled to a salary since he was awarded a special pension last year also of $730 a month or 1315 reals
i never made much money and a thousand more or less won't make much difference it's the way i was fired villas boas said by telephone from his home in sao paulo
i and my brothers created funai i chose the name after 40 50 years funai decides i'm not worth anything he said i guess we're just like the indians - unprotected by the state
no one was available at the agency on saturday to comment bureau president frederico mares de souza filho who signed the fax reportedly was visiting tribes in the amazon region
villas boas and his three brothers claudio alvaro and leonardo were pioneers in brazil's amazon pushing into the uncharted jungle in the 1940s to make contact with tribes that had never seen westerners they witnessed the harm that roads and airstrips caused to indians and became outspoken defenders of indian rights
orlando and claudio the most famous of the four eventually moved in with indians and stayed for 32 years in 1961 they persuaded the government to create its first and probably most successful reservation - xingu national park
seventeen indian nations were transferred from ancestral lands to the 56 million-acre park in northern mato grosso state 870 miles northwest of rio de janeiro today more than 3000 indians live there in relative isolation from white culture
orlando the last surviving brother urged the indians to resist intrusion by any means necessary he is revered by tribal leaders and in 1998 he was honored in xingu at a kuarup a scared ritual for the dead in tribute to his deceased brothers

electricity from greece which would alleviate shortages in kosovo has been held up by infrastructure problems in albania and macedonia officials said saturday
the power would have to transit these countries to reach kosovo
according to the un mission in kosovo the province needs 620-650 megawatts of power at peak periods this winter the main power plant at obilic can only generate about 450 megawatts
although the station escaped damage during the 78-day nato airstrikes against yugoslavia last year it has suffered severe neglect over the past decade
approximately 100 megawatts are currently being imported from serbia macedonia and albania
greece has promised to donate at least 60 megawatts of power a day and said it could substantially increase this amount if necessary however infrastructure problems in neighboring macedonia and albania are presently preventing delivery of the donated power
electricity can be cut off for up to eight hours a day in most areas some households have even suffered power cuts for more than 24 hours but a rotation system has been introduced to cope with the deficit
the long power outages during the harsh winter have forced many residents to resort to wood-burning stoves because central heating systems are dependent on electricity but even fire wood is often not sufficiently available
macedonians fear that transmitting power through their country could cause problems in their own power grid even though broken lines for such transmissions have been repaired said joan pierce responsible for donor coordination and utilities in kosovo
everybody agrees there is some risk pierce said but the macedonians tend to take the line that any risk is not acceptable
officials in macedonia have said opening the disused negotino power plant in the west of the country would enable greece to transit through to kosovo but financing is not yet secured and negotiations are dragging on
the united nations is also looking into supplying energy from greece through albania pierce says although infrastructure problems exist there as well
in early january kosovo's top international administrator bernard kouchner blamed macedonian authorities for holding up at the border 20 tons of oil needed to run the plants
repairing the two main power plants kosovo a and kosovo b in obilic six miles east of the capital pristina is also proving to be an uphill struggle
each of the two units at the 15-year-old kosovo b station have a capacity of about 200-250 megawatts but one was shut down after a fire there earlier this month the cause of the fire has not yet been determined
once begun repairs will take at least four weeks said bill white head of british company mott macdonald in charge of restoring the power plant

a 32-year-old housewife became the first woman to file for divorce under a new law that makes it easier for egyptian women to leave their husbands
wafa mosaad gabr who had been trying to end her marriage for three years filed for divorce because she simply didn't want to live with her husband el-sayyed mohammed ibrahim a 38-year old farmer the woman's lawyer said the lawyer mostafa eid did not elaborate
the law which had faced strong opposition in male-dominated and overwhelmingly muslim egypt was passed by the country's people's assembly wednesday night and approved by president hosni mubarak on saturday
the new legislation makes it easier for women to obtain a divorce though the process remains more difficult for women than it is for men islamic law gives men the right to divorce their wives anytime and without the approval of a court or any other authority
under the old law women had to prove that physical or psychological harm was caused by husbands to obtain a divorce
now women must only declare before a court that they want a divorce judges will give the couple three months to try and reconcile and six months if they have children an immediate divorce will be granted at the end of the trial period if they don't change their minds
under the new law women who divorce their husbands must return their dowries and relinquish all financial claims including alimony
gabr who got married in 1986 had previously asked her husband to divorce her eid said
if gabr gets her divorce she will return the equivalent of $30 which her husband paid as a dowry but for her three children she would still get child support payments which are not affected under the new law
the first hearing in the case is set for march 14
the first american trade show in communist cuba in four decades wrapped up on saturday with organizers saying that several manufacturers of us medical products expected to make sales to government hospitals and clinics in coming months
it went exceedingly well - much better than expected said peter w nathan president of pwn exhibicion llc of westport conn as exhibitors packed up x-ray machines and other hospital equipment in cardboard boxes
several of the 97 american companies that participated are expected to apply for licenses from the us treasury department to sell products to cuban medical institutions nathan said he did not provide specifics
whether the money to buy is there remains to be seen but there is interest said nathan
the us healthcare exhibition is the latest small advance in us-cuban relations since january 1999 when president clinton changed rules to allow increased contact between americans and cubans and to ease sales of medical goods
almost a decade after the collapse of its socialist partners in eastern europe the cuban government remains strapped for hard currency and often cannot come up with the cash needed to buy imported goods payments to us companies are complicated by the us trade embargo
but long-term contacts rather than sales were the goal with this first show nathan said
rules limiting us medical exports to cuba under decades-old trade sanctions were eased last year there have been several proposals to fully lift restrictions on food and medical sales but they have failed to gain full congressional approval
we found that they wanted a lot of information said denisse garcia latin american operations manager for datex-ohmedia which exhibited anesthesia machines and baby incubators
datex-ohmedia as many of the other exhibitors was donating some of its equipment to hospitals and clinics it was giving an incubator to the nonprofit roman catholic charity caritas and leaving an anesthesia machine for the government's medcuba agency
miguel angel campomanes director of latin american sales for zeiss optical devices said he had received enough interest to make as much as $1 million in sales if they have the money
the booth run by zeiss humphrey of dublin calif was among the most popular during the five-day show because of its free vision tests
archer daniels midland co of decatur ill the show's primary sponsor also attracted much attention for its vitamin e samples
other major exhibitors included eastman kodak co imaging devices eli lilly &amp co pharmaceuticals and gerber products co nutritional products for children
us officials say that since 1992 they have granted 40 to 50 licenses to american companies to sell medicines and medical supplies in cuba and that only a handful of requests have been turned down
the us government says it licensed $19 million worth of american medical sales to cuba in 1998 and $26 million worth in the first half of 1999
but actual sales have been much lower us officials say
the last such us trade gathering on the island is believed to have been a 1960 meeting for american travel agents
far-right populist joerg haider whose party rose to prominence in austria after stoking anti-foreigner sentiment last fall predicted saturday that a government featuring his party would impose a nearly complete ban on immigration
haider said the only foreigners who would be allowed to move to austria would be seasonal workers who would leave after several months
he made the announcement as the stream of foreign criticism continued over the possibility of his freedom party's inclusion in government his party now austria's second largest has been talking to the austrian people's party about forming a coalition that would control parliament
undeterred by the furor abroad negotiators from his party and the center-right people's party were planning to resume their talks aimed at setting up a joint cabinet next week
haider is known for once praising adolf hitler's orderly employment policy and for later lauding veterans of the waffen ss as decent people of good character he has been apologizing ever since
but his party made stunning gains in austria's oct 3 parliamentary elections drawing heavily on voters who fear that eu expansion and a liberal immigration policy will cost them their jobs
by saturday most european governments had criticized haider the european union has warned austria against setting up a government that includes haider's party and belgium is calling for common eu action if such a coalition materializes
among those joining the chorus of critics were french president jacques chirac german president johannes rau and german chancellor gerhard schroeder
austria must see to it not to isolate itself politically schroeder told the bild am sonntag newspaper
chirac was reportedly pressing the eu to take precise measures if haider's party joins the austrian government the measures were not specified
catherine colonna chirac's spokeswoman said the president called portuguese prime minister antonio guterres to tell him it is indispensable that austria's 14 european partners act quickly portugal currently holds the rotating eu presidency
haider reacting to chirac's moves said the french president had done everything wrong that can be done wrong
the president of the european parliament nicole fontaine said on french radio that the eu has sanction powers that would let it exclude member nations guterres meanwhile phoned austrian president thomas klestil to express his concern over the political developments
answering questions on austrian state radio haider said saturday that his party and the people's party are in full agreement on what austria's new immigration policy should look like he said it would be tantamount to a de facto zero immigration and that the country should focus on integrating the foreigners already in austria instead of letting in more
the only exception he said would be for seasonal tourism industry laborers who would be allowed in from abroad he added that such a policy cannot be challenged internationally and on a european scale
in the radio interview haider said he was taking the foreign criticism in stride
basically such criticism was to be expected from those who cannot put up with the fact that democracy means change and democracy means that the people can decide what they want he said
we want a europe of the citizens and not one of bureaucrats haider stressed reiterating his past criticisms of the european union
in a welcome distraction from the furor haider celebrated his 50th birthday saturday stunt fliers costumed musicians and a giant apple strudel were on hand as hundreds celebrated the popular leader's birthday near villach a mountain town high in the austrian alps
haider visibly enjoyed the accolades from fans and freedom party colleagues after skiing to several mountain huts he was cheered by about 300 people who lined up to greet him and give him presents
at one point he danced to alpine music well known in carinthia province where he is governor
robert shoaf knelt over one of the 10 craters now dotting his property and sighed in disbelief as he clasped a jagged strip of artillery shrapnel
one hundred yards that way it would have hit my house shoaf said saturday pointing west to the home he shares with his wife joan about 100 miles southwest of dallas
just days earlier shoaf and 11 other family members who live on the 300-acre cattle ranch were ducking for cover as army battalions eight miles away at fort hood launched a volley of 155 mm howitzer artillery shells toward their property
it roared like a whistle and then a bomb exploded the 70-year-old said i didn't know what it was until the next morning when we found the holes
a 4-foot length of the foundation of his home cracked and chunks of shrapnel lodged in the nearby home of his son jay
it was unreal like a war zone said jay shoaf's wife tammy
the force of wednesday night's blasts which continued for about an hour shook pictures off of walls broke a chandelier in the family room and cracked sections of dry wall
the shelling happened during a training exercise involving two artillery battalions said lt col maryane cummings a spokeswoman for fort hood
we're really concerned about safety so that is why we stopped all practice firing until we find out what happened she said
cummings said she would not speculate on what went wrong she said base officials are conducting an investigation
robert shoaf said army officials had been out to survey the damage on friday and were expected to return to meet with the family on tuesday his family wants some assurance that it won't happen again
we still live here said tammy shoaf they better check their instruments before they start up again
another federal judge has ruled that the immigration and naturalization service cannot indefinitely hold immigrants who have been ordered deported for crimes but whose native countries refuse to accept them
us district judge terry j hatter's ruling affects 130 legal immigrants being held at detention centers in central california who already have served prison time for their crimes
hatter said the policy violates the immigrants' rights to due process concluding that they pose a flight risk or danger is not sufficient reason to detain them for what amounts to the rest of their lives he said
the 9th us circuit court of appeals has agreed to review a similar ruling by a federal judge in seattle that case is scheduled to be argued next month but a decision likely is several months away
the 130 immigrants affected by thursday's ruling have all completed prison sentences that averaged about three years deputy federal public defender david mclane said saturday their cases will have to be heard by magistrate judges before they are released
theoretically everybody gets out hopefully over the next couple of months deputy federal public defender robert boyle said
one of the immigrants was sentenced to a day in jail for stealing a razor from sears and food from a grocery store he has been in custody for three years boyle said
nationwide the ins holds about 3800 people in indefinite custody for crimes ranging from petty theft to murder
the practice has been upheld by federal judges in san diego and nevada and by federal appeals courts in new orleans and philadelphia
hatter's ruling was hailed by civil liberties groups that have criticized the ins policy
this is a resounding rejection of the immigration and naturalization service argument that they can hold someone forever said lucas guttentag director of the american civil liberties union's immigrants' rights project
the court recognized that the purpose of immigration detention is to effectuate deportation not to sentence someone to life in prison guttentag said
us district judge harold h greene who oversaw the breakup of at&ampt as a jurist and played a key role in shaping two of the nation's landmark civil rights laws as a government attorney died saturday he was 76
greene who succumbed to a cerebral hemorrhage at his home spent more than three decades as a judge on district of columbia and federal courts presiding over hundreds of cases but his name is most attached to the 1984 at&ampt breakup the largest antitrust case in us history
for years afterward he continued to supervise the consent decree that broke ma bell into seven regional operating companies helping to spark the technological revolution that has transformed telecommunications
americans as a result now can shop for the best price for long-distance service and buy their own phones instead of renting them forever
earlier as a senior justice department attorney greene drafted much of the 1965 voting rights act as well as the 1964 civil rights act
on the bench greene was known as an organized judge who combined a gentle manner with firm control over his courtroom
born heinz gruenhaus in frankfurt germany in february 1923 greene became a us citizen and americanized his name after his jewish parents fled germany in 1939
he earned his law degree at night at george washington university became an assistant us attorney and later moved to justice department headquarters heading the civil rights division's appeals and research section
burke marshall who headed the division at the time once recalled that greene's section wrote the legal briefs leading to the supreme court's 1962 ruling that congressional districts must represent approximately an equal number of people
greene took senior status on the district court with a reduced workload on aug 6 1995 30 years to the day after president johnson named him to the district of columbia court of general sessions in 1978 president carter promoted him to the federal bench from the chief judgeship of the dc court of appeals
greene was proud that he persuaded former president reagan to testify on videotape in former national security adviser john poindexter's 1990 iran-contra trial without a supreme court confrontation reagan had resisted but greene said that when the time came i found him very pleasant he didn't put on any airs
in 1986 greene blocked the library of congress from banning from its building five people who had protested cuts in the library's public hours banning is not one of the remedies present in the us constitution he wrote perhaps in the soviet union or south africa but not here
greene acknowledged he was considered an activist judge telling the associated press i do tend to hold in favor of the person who's gotten the raw deal
he unsuccessfully attacked federal sentencing guidelines that sharply limit judges' discretion he and some fellow jurists insisted the guidelines give prosecutors too much power to determine sentences by deciding what charges to file
despite his varied achievements even greene's friends persisted in linking him to the at&ampt case
in a 1995 interview then-white house counsel abner mikva former chief judge of the federal appeals court in washington recalled an incident when he and greene were going to another judge's christmas party
on the way over mikva said greene was grumbling that people had descended on him at a telephone store when he went in to buy a phone and someone had spotted him as the man who made phone-shopping possible
that's the price of presiding over a big case mikva said he told his colleague and when they arrived at the party greene heard it all over again - this time from then-chief justice warren burger
burger said harold let me tell you what you've done to my phone bill' mikva said he recalled that greene just gave me that wry smile
greene leaves his wife evelyn a son a daughter and three grandchildren
former chancellor helmut kohl strongly rejected accusations that money changed hands under the table in a deal involving a former east german refinery a newspaper reported sunday
in an interview published in welt am sonntag kohl echoed an earlier denial by his spokesman that he had discussed money with then-french president francois mitterrand in making the deal
i at no time received money and also had no knowledge whatsoever about shady financial machinations the newspaper quoted kohl as saying
a report by german and french television claimed last weekend that mitterrand arranged for payment of $15 million to the christian democrats in 1992 to help the campaign of his friend kohl part of payoffs for the deal by french oil concern elf aquitaine to buy the leuna refinery
the accusations now raised - that mitterrand allowed me to receive 30 million marks for the campaign in connection with elf aquitaine's involvement in leuna - are absurd kohl was quoted as saying
they are a terrible concoction of unproven statements slander and anonymous tips he said
kohl said that making the leuna deal happen prevented mass unemployment in the area of the refinery and said he even acted against west german companies that would have preferred to go without the competition
kohl underscored that he at no time discussed concrete details of the deal with mitterrand saying those were not the things that politicians dealt with
the super-secret national security agency confirmed saturday night that it had a serious computer problem last week that affected its ability to process intelligence information
the agency issued a brief statement a few hours after the outage was reported by abc news which said its sources characterized the problem as the biggest computer failure in the history of the nsa
this problem which was contained to the nsa headquarters complex at fort meade md did not affect intelligence collection but did affect the processing of intelligence information the agency statement said nsa systems were impacted for 72 hours
it said the outage started at 7 pm est monday and that the system was restored on thursday
there was no evidence of malice or no evidence of a y2k problem said an agency official who asked not to be identified by name
contingency plans were immediately put into effect that called on other aspects of the nsa system to assume some of the load the agency statement said while intelligence collection continued nsa technicians worked to recover the it information technology infrastructure that backlog of intelligence processing is almost complete and nsa is confident that no significant intelligence information has been lost
the statement said the agency is currently operating within the window of normal operations
until a few years ago the national security agency was so secret there was no public acknowledgment by the government of its existence and employees could be disciplined for merely saying they worked there
it specializes in electronic intelligence gathering through satellites telephone intercepts and other methods
the defense department acknowledged earlier this month that it made mistakes in its pre-new year's eve testing of a y2k correction for a computer system that processes imagery from intelligence satellites
the computer system broke down that night interrupting the flow of by satellite information for several hours
however the pentagon insisted the trouble did not jeopardize us national security
bill bradley is getting an almost endorsement from the conservative new hampshire sunday news
the newspaper said saturday it will publish an editorial headlined almost an endorsement committed democrats should vote for bradley
the newspaper and its daily companion the union leader rarely endorse democrats in presidential elections in tuesday's primary the newspapers have endorsed republican steve forbes
an excerpt of the editorial says vice president al gore's dishonesty in this campaign makes him an unacceptable choice for democratic-leaning voters
the reference apparently is to the latest fight between bradley and gore over the vice president's past statements regarding abortion
bradley has suggested gore has misrepresented his own record as well as others bradley insists gore once opposed abortion yet during this campaign he claims he always supported a woman's right to choose
bradley rhetorically asked supporters saturday in manchester how can women trust somebody who doesn't tell the truth in a campaign to tell the truth as president
gore retracted his 13-year-old statement equating abortion to the taking of a human life as he scrambled to keep the issue a traditional stumbling block for republicans from tripping him up against bradley
yes my position has changed gore said saturday i strongly support a woman's right to choose and if bradley disputes that then he is making a mistake
bradley began airing a new television ad in the state saturday in which the former new jersey senator calls himself the only presidential candidate who has been pro-choice for everyone all the time
democratic presidential candidate bill bradley said he has required anesthesia for treatment of his irregular heartbeat but his doctor reaffirmed that he is fit to be president the new york times reported sunday
bradley 56 has known he has a heart irregularity known as atrial fibrillation since 1996
three times after attacks of fibrillation bradley has needed a procedure known as cardioversion in which the heart is jolted with electricity to snap it back into normal rhythm
before undergoing a cardioversion a patient is made unconscious for several minutes with an anesthetic and sedative to avoid feeling the burning pain from the jolts of electricity the times said
in an interview with the paper bradley recalled they give you anesthesia you kind of drift and then when you wake up they say you are back in rhythm when you wake up you are completely alert you can function
asked what he would do if he needed such a procedure as president bradley told the paper he might have to invoke the 25th amendment using its provisions to turn over executive power to his vice president temporarily
interesting i do not know bradley said i have not thought of that he added that the 25th amendment sounds a reasonable way to go but that this was a decision that i can make down the road a little bit
bradley's doctors told the paper he is in excellent physical condition and that his bouts of irregular heartbeat were not a serious threat to his health or to his ability to be president
bradley should be able to function perfectly fine as president said dr robert h heissenbuttel his personal physician at columbia-presbyterian medical center in new york city
on friday bradley said he experienced another irregular heartbeat episode several days earlier it was his fifth in the past month but didn't require a doctor's attention
bradley disclosed on dec 10 - after he had to cancel a campaign event because his heart wouldn't stop racing - that he has the condition since 1996 the former senator called the condition a minor irritation and said he hadn't felt the need to reveal his condition
vice president al gore retracted his 13-year-old statement equating abortion to the taking of a human life as he scrambled saturday to keep the issue a traditional stumbling block for republicans from tripping him up against democrat bill bradley
yes my position has changed gore said i strongly support a woman's right to choose and if bradley disputes that then he is making a mistake
bradley began airing a new television ad in the state saturday in which the former new jersey senator calls himself the only presidential candidate who has been pro-choice for everyone all the time
campaigning in manchester bradley said i was pro-choice from the day i entered politics it's not an issue you can dance around
meanwhile the conservative new hampshire sunday news said it was giving an almost endorsement to bradley because gore's dishonesty in this campaign makes him an unacceptable choice for democratic-leaning voters
the sunday paper and it's daily companion the union leader rarely endorses democrats in presidential primaries the papers have already endorsed steve forbes in the republican primary
to try and settle the bedrock abortion question for many democratic women gore indulged several reporters' questions as coffee in hand he walked through milford's town square
gore who represented tennessee in the house from 1977-85 and the senate from 1985-93 was asked whether he still believes that abortion - in the questioner's words - is the taking of a human life
obviously prepared gore was quick to recall that he had qualified the statement at the time i didn't write that i didn't i used the word arguably and yes my position has changed gore acknowledged
indeed in a 1987 letter to a constituent gore wrote that abortion is arguably the taking of a human life in any event gore added that he would not use that phrasing today
gore said the only abortion matter with which he had wrestled was whether public money should help pay for abortions for poor women - the medicaid funding for abortions he says he now supports
i've always supported keeping abortion legal and i've always been attacked by the anti-choice groups for that position since the beginning of my career gore said
in fact the national right to life committee gave gore an 84 percent approval rating for anti-abortion votes he cast while in the house
by contrast the national abortion and reproductive rights action league rated gore's house career decidedly anti-choice
among the 30 votes the group scored against gore was his yea in 1984 to define the word person under four existing civil rights laws to include unborn children from the moment of conception the organization characterized that as a move toward an all out prohibition on abortion
nancy greaney a gore supporter and former teacher from bedford was surprised to learn of gore's record but said i'd never hold it against him
i think people's opinions and beliefs evolve greaney said
ellie bosman an undecided democrat who shook hands with gore in the milford square saturday was conflicted about reports of gore's abortion record
i don't think it's a crime to change your mind but i wish more politicians would admit they changed their minds the retired teacher said
whatever the case bosman added bradley demeaned gores character by implying he lied
bradley had cornered gore in debate on wednesday pressing him to concede his inconsistency on abortion rights in the days since the vice president has faced more questions about his record
bradley orchestrated the debate question and follow-up tv commercial in a drive to undercut gore's support among women and reverse his own slip in polls in time for tuesday's first-in-the-nation primary
a front page article friday in the boston globe which has a large circulation in new hampshire questioned the veracity of gore's statement in debate that he had always been for a woman's right to choose asked friday afternoon about the morning paper's story gore a former journalist and avid news reader said he had not seen it
a woman caller to new hampshire public radio the same day told gore on-air i understand if you've changed your position in your career but i don't know how i can support your candidacy if you're dishonest about such an important subject and especially on national television
spooked at the prospect of doubt taking hold the gore campaign rounded up a testimonial from feminist gloria steinem and signatures from 42 members of congress in an open letter stating what gore once had counted on being obvious in this election al gore is pro-choice
that letter was e-mailed to hundreds of reporters and passed around a state democratic dinner it was followed by a list of 300 new hampshire women pledging their support for gore
gore spokesman chris lehane called the flurry of paper an effort to help the press
gore also went to air saturday night with a tv ad labeling himself pro-education pro-environment pro-choice
rep jerry nadler d-ny and other bradley backers stood outside gore's town meeting in lebanon to distribute a 1984 letter in which gore wrote it is my deep personal conviction that abortion is wrong innocent human life must be protected
said nadler he wrote this and voted to give civil rights protection to the fetus so if he says he was always pro-choice he's wrong
inside gore told his audience that bradley has sought in recent days to manufacture some differences on issues where there really are no differences of the 13 questions he fielded from voters none was about abortion
starting this spring passengers on one alaska airlines jet will be able to watch espn the learning channel and cnn during flights if enough passengers tune in the airline may offer satellite tv in all of its jetliners
while many international flights and some transcontinental flights offer movies most shorter domestic flights don't provide video entertainment alaska airlines' test plane will have small video screens on the backs of all its seats giving passengers access to the shorter programs on 24 cable channels
our programs for the most part come in 30-minute segments that's perfect for these short-haul flights said terry ferguson vice president of business development and strategic planning for directv which is providing the programming
alaska airlines officials must decide whether to charge for the service or offer it free
costs for the service are high the antenna needed to capture the television signals bounced off satellites by directv costs about $250000 per airplane experts say while adding the screens could cost $8000 per seat
the views of business travelers would carry much weight in alaska airlines' test and business travelers interviewed friday at seattle-tacoma international airport didn't think much of the idea
it wouldn't convince me to switch said tony damiano a plastics salesman from oakland calif i'm more concerned with routes alaska only flies north and south and about half my trips are west to east and besides i don't want to split up my frequent flier miles
mel spencer who owns a chain of furniture rental stores and has homes in phoenix and puyallup wash also was skeptical of the service
tv all it's going to do is raise the price of the ticket he said what's this world coming to if you can't entertain yourself in an airplane for two hours or so without watching tv
republican george w bush who would be president campaigned for the first time saturday alongside his father who once was as the field of white house hopefuls plowed toward this week's leadoff new hampshire primary bill bradley charged al gore was trying to dance around earlier qualms about abortion as he bid to cut into the vice president's core democratic support
with the polls pointing to a tight finish at least on the republican side sen john mccain mocked bush's endgame strategy as quick get me another endorsement from the gop establishment people lining up behind the front-runner now are the same ones running our party in 1996 and 1998 when we lost elections said the arizona senator who has come from far back in the pack to within striking distance of victory in the state
gore who has moved past bradley in recent polls sought to blunt his rival's attack on his position on abortion and his credibility asked whether he would say abortion is arguably the taking of a human life as he wrote to a constituent 1987 the vice president said i would not use that phrasing today
he quickly added though that on the narrow question i've always supported roe v wade i've always supported keeping abortion legal
bradley meanwhile acknowledged in an interview being published sunday by the new york times that he has briefly undergone anesthesia three times for treatment of his irregular heart beat since december 1996 bradley's physician reiterated in the article that the condition does not inhibit bradley's ability to serve as president
steve forbes who finished a strong second in last week's iowa caucuses alan keyes and gary bauer all made their rounds on the campaign's final weekend hoping for surprises in tuesday's vote that would catapult them into the thick of the gop race forbes released new radio commercials attacking bush for failing to be a firm enough foe of abortion and for overseeing a big increase in spending in texas
the crowds were bigger saturday the political theater more entertaining as new hampshire voters prepared to render their verdict a man stood on a manchester street corner wearing a bill clinton mask and waving a bush placard his presence on a wind-whipped day underscored that this begins the flood of primaries that will lead to election of the current president's successor
still after months of campaigning and thousands of candidate speeches not everyone was ready to declare a preference i'm slow to make my decision said robi jackson 57 of portsmouth who described herself as leaning toward bush my feeling is they all have wonderful ideas but when you get to washington well you know what they say talk is cheap'
a bush victory tuesday would cement his credentials as front-runner and damage if not cripple mccain's ability to sustain his challenge the texas governor began his day in portsmouth where he appeared before one of the largest crowds he's seen thus far an estimated 1000 people
from there he went to milford where he posed for a bush family political appearance father george bush mother barbara and other family members flanked him joined as well by elizabeth dole the wife of the 1996 presidential nominee and herself a campaign dropout this time around
this boy this son of ours is not going to let you down promised the former president - who ran three times in the new hampshire primary and won twice he's going to go all the way
when i heard my family was coming up here to knock on doors it gave me that extra impetus to keep charging in new hampshire said his son
aboard mccain's campaign bus the candidate said the gop establishment has become more and more alarmed at the possibility of his victory we've interfered with a coronation
in the democratic race bradley unveiled a new television ad that said of abortion this is the kind of issue that you can't straddle campaigning during the day the former new jersey senator said i was pro-choice from the day i entered politics and i will always be pro-choice it's not an issue you can dance around
gore said in campaign debate last week that he had once opposed federal funding for abortions under medicaid but had otherwise always been for abortion rights
yes my position has changed gore said i strongly support a woman's right to choose and if bradley disputes that then he is making a mistake
bauer plunged into the democratic dispute questioning gore's candor
i almost fell off my chair when i saw al gore deny that he had ever been pro-life he said
when it comes to an issue this profound a politician that plays games on something involving life and death i think loses all credibility to aspire to the white house he said
keyes said he doesn't plan any abrupt change in strategy in the final days of a race that looks bleak for him i think one of the things most important for us is to walk the walk with integrity it's dictated by the fact that i think this is what the country needs he said

as part of its campaign to clean up its image the cult accused in the 1995 nerve-gas attack on tokyo subways offered saturday to pay a total of $114 million a year as compensation to the victims
tatsuko muraoka who replaced shoko asahara as guru of the aum shinri kyo cult this month said several tens of thousands of dollars will be paid to the victims immediately
i don't intend to deny that i bear a heavy responsibility said fumihiro joyu one of the cult's leaders appearing before reporters for the first time since his release from prison last month
it was not immediately clear how many people the cult was offering to compensate
aum which recently changed its name to aleph also said it will start a personal computer company and transfer all proceeds into a victims fund
the announcement comes as aum tries to soften its image tokyo toughened its laws last month to let authorities seize aum's assets more easily and monitor the cult more closely
a government panel is preparing to announce in the coming week what affect the decision will have on aum
last month the cult apologized for the subway gassing that killed 12 people and sickened 5500 people - something it had refused to do for the last five years
the cult's recent expressions of contrition however have been received with deep skepticism by the japanese public not only because of its timing but also because the cult has not opened its books
police say it earns about $66 million a year from its discount computer chain stores the cult is believed to operate other businesses and have revenue from followers' donations it can also sell its assets
aum had promised to compensate the victims but saturday's announcement was the first time it gave figures and some details on the compensation
joyu who acknowledged asahara's involvement in the gassing defended asahara's teachings
i approve of our exalted teacher asahara's spiritual practices joyu told reporters at the cult's yokohama office
joyu who was never charged in the subway gassing denied knowing about the attack in advance but said he had been overexuberant in defending the cult and denying its guilt
i'd like to apologize for that joyu said appearing before the cameras in a conservative suit instead of the loose robes that used to be the cult trademark
asahara is on trial on charges of masterminding the sarin gassing cult members have also been charged in the slaying of an anti-cult lawyer and his family the murders of wayward followers and a separate sarin gassing that killed seven people and sickened more than 200 in a residential area in central japan in 1994

abner w sibal a former two-term republican member of the house from connecticut died thursday of a heart attack at his home in nearby alexandria va he was 78
sibel served in congress from 1961 until his defeat for re-election in 1964 he practiced law in washington until becoming general counsel of the equal employment opportunity commission in 1975 serving until 1978
survivors include his wife marjorie two children and five stepchildren
boston bruins coach pat burns said he had no quarrel with owner jeremy jacobs who blamed coaching for the team's lackluster performance this season
i can understand jeremy's position burns said before saturday night's 1-0 victory over the buffalo sabres when you own a multi-million dollar business you can damn well criticize who you want
burns recently notched his 400th career victory and is only the 14th coach in nhl history to reach that milestone he has also coached in 800 games with a 569 winning percentage
pat is a hell of a coach but with all their injuries he is playing with the providence bruins roster and he is still doing a good job buffalo sabres coach lindy ruff said
boston 17-21-13-4 has stumbled in part because of goalie byron dafoe's contract holdout and forward jason allison's season-ending injury
this thing coming out today was surprising bruins captain ray bourque said we don't need that right now and it is a distraction
the bruins fighting for the eastern conference's final playoff spot were expected to compete for the conference title this season their poor performance has caused the typically hands-off jacobs to speak out
i think our team has been managed well by harry sinden and mike o'connell jacobs told the boston globe referring to the general manager and his assistant but our coaching has not been what i think it should be
i think our coaches need to do a better job i don't feel our fans are getting what they deserve they should be getting better than what we've done
two people died early saturday morning in a house fire as firefighters desperately tried to reach them seven others inside the burning home were able to escape officials said
fire officials said the blaze appears to have started accidentally
the fire at 707 w 4th st began shortly before 5 am
deputy fire chief paul newborn said the victims appeared to have been living in the basement of the 2 1/2-story home
anthonius eugene 24 and irene cancel 23 died in the blaze
no other injuries were reported
the fire was under control around 10 am newborn said
newborn said there were smoke detectors upstairs which had alerted the residents
officials from the union county arson task force focused their attention primarily on the basement where the two had perished
we're calling the fire accidental from a heat source said newborn who would not say whether a space heater had caused the fire
we had some reports of space heaters downstairs said newborn but we're pretty sure at this point that the fire started in the basement however it remains under further investigation
timothy jack 32 has lived on w 4th st for 15 years and said keeping warm during the colder months has always been a problem for people living in these multiple-family homes
like everyone else around here you leave your oven on to keep warm he said i mean look at these old houses with these old windows that's the only way you can keep warm
newborn said there was no stove in the basement living area
the owner of the building was at the scene several hours after the fire had been declared under control but he refused to speak to reporters
departments from several neighboring departments were also called to help battle the blaze
the seven survivors had been placed temporarily in a nearby hotel off route 22 officials said their names had not been released
vitali yachmenev scored a short-handed goal and an empty-net tally and tomas vokoun made 34 saves saturday night leading the nashville predators to a 3-1 win over the calgary flames
it was nashville's third win in four games moving the second-year predators within four points of the final playoff spot in the western conference
the flames lost their third straight and second in 24 hours calgary lost 4-1 friday night at detroit
nashville defenseman mark millar scored the first goal on a long wrist shot that sailed past flames goalie jean-sebastien giguere's left skate
vokoun was at his best in the third period stopping 18 of 19 shots
yachmenev made it 2-0 on a short-handed breakaway 439 into the third when he slipped a back-hander by giguere before slamming face-first into the rear boards
valeri bure scored calgary's only goal with 445 seconds left a sixth-attacker goal in a scramble of players yachmenev scored into the empty net with one second left in the game
with 911 remaining in the second and nashville ahead 1-0 the crowd of 16729 came to its feet when the predators wished the tennessee titans well in sunday's super bowl against the st louis rams
gar heard was fired saturday night as coach of the washington wizards the team's first major move since michael jordan became head of basketball operations
heard was fired after the wizards' 103-98 victory over the cleveland cavaliers washington is 14-30 and in last place in the atlantic division
rod higgins an assistant with the golden state warriors and a former teammate of jordan's in chicago will be the new coach
jordan in atlanta for the super bowl was not with the team when the announcement was made
i mentioned that when i was became a member of the washington wizards that i would evaluate the team and the coaching staff jordan was quoted as saying in a statement released by the team i felt it was necessary to make a change at this time
jordan joined the team jan 19 and vowed to shake things up it was immediately clear that heard was on the hit list heard had very little one-on-one contact with jordan from the start and jordan put on a jersey and used his own motivational tactics to liven up one of heard's practices on monday
you never have a chance to show what you can do heard said unfortunately that's the nature of the business i think they had their mind made up when he got here i never got an opportunity to talk to him when you come in you want to bring your own people next time things will work better
the wizards job was a long-awaited break for heard who toiled for 12 years as an assistant with dallas indiana philadelphia and detroit his only previous head coaching experience in the nba was in 1993 as interim coach of the dallas mavericks who were 9-44 under him
i'm sure this won't be my last opportunity heard said when you get older you have to work a little harder
heard's old-school style didn't suit thirtysomething veterans particularly point guard rod strickland who is notoriously late for practices and admits to not giving his all on the practice court
it's been tough around here strickland said the atmosphere hasn't been good it's been a lot of negativity so put it on the players put it on the coaches put it on everybody - things weren't right and it wasn't fun
said heard you still need players to win in this league maybe now they will step up
also fired were assistants butch beard and mike bratz assistant tree rollins will be retained
the wizards haven't won a playoff game in 12 years and higgins will be the team's fifth coach since 1996 following jim lynam bernie bickerstaff jim brovelli and heard
higgins who turned 40 on monday will be a first-time head coach he has been an assistant with the warriors for six seasons following a 13-year playing career with chicago seattle san antonio new jersey sacramento cleveland and golden state he played with jordan in chicago in the 1984-85 season and again at the end of the 1985-86 season
general manager wes unseld would not confirm higgins' hiring but several players said they were told that higgins would be the coach
coach heard also mentioned that rod higgins would come in and be our coach for the rest of the year forward juwan howard said i watched him as a kid growing up when he was with the chicago bulls
heard and the players were caught off guard by the news which came after a sloppy but tense home victory
the timing was kind of funny forward aaron williams said everybody's spirits were up after a good win that we really needed
most players however figured something was in the air given the team's woes and jordan's vow to turn around the franchise
it can't get any worse i don't think strickland said at least i hope
bill bradley is getting an almost endorsement from the conservative new hampshire sunday news
the newspaper said saturday it will publish an editorial headlined almost an endorsement committed democrats should vote for bradley
the newspaper and its daily companion the union leader rarely endorse democrats in presidential elections in tuesday's primary the newspapers have endorsed republican steve forbes
an excerpt of the editorial says vice president al gore's dishonesty in this campaign makes him an unacceptable choice for democratic-leaning voters
the reference was to the latest fight between bradley and gore over the vice president's past statements regarding abortion
bradley has suggested gore has misrepresented his own record as well as others bradley insists gore once opposed abortion yet during this campaign he claims he always supported a woman's right to choose
bradley rhetorically asked supporters saturday in manchester how can women trust somebody who doesn't tell the truth in a campaign to tell the truth as president
gore retracted his 13-year-old statement equating abortion to the taking of a human life as he scrambled to keep the issue a traditional stumbling block for republicans from tripping him up against bradley
yes my position has changed gore said saturday i strongly support a woman's right to choose and if bradley disputes that then he is making a mistake
bradley began airing a new television ad in the state saturday in which the former new jersey senator calls himself the only presidential candidate who has been pro-choice for everyone all the time
a jury has found an essex county man guilty of a murder-for-hire plot in which his wife died of drowning after water was forced down her throat in the couple's lake placid home
saturday afternoon's verdict means jeffrey glanda 49 could face the death penalty or life in prison for first-degree murder the jury began deliberations friday afternoon after a 14-day trial filled with testimony of a marriage torn apart and grisly details of the beating that led to the death of jeannine glanda
the body of 39-year-old jeannine glanda was discovered in august 1997 in a ford explorer that was partially submerged in a nearby lake
according to testimony glanda offered his landscaper a long-time friend named nicholas pecararo $15000 a new pickup truck and a snowmobile to help commit the murder
in his closing argument friday lead defense counsel dennis schlenker attacked the testimony of pecararo and julius elmore - the prosecutions star witnesses - calling them the most despicable human beings he ever met according to the plattsburgh press-republican
pecararo said he was 15 years old when he met the defendant and did landscaping work around glanda's home pecararo testified that he and glanda attacked and killed mrs glanda but the defense tried to argue that pecararo committed the murder and lied to skirt the death penalty saying that someone else killed the woman
pecararo pleaded guilty in 1997 to second-degree murder in exchange for his testimony the plea lets the tupper lake man avoid the death penalty
district attorney ronald briggs in closing arguments friday described the breakdown of the glandas' relationship in 1994 their separation and how mr glanda offered a plattsburgh auto mechanic donald hilborn $10000 in 1996 to kill mrs glanda
briggs then fast-forwarded to 1997 citing pecararo's testimony
pecararo testified that after glanda attacked his wife in her home he shocked her with a stun gun while pecararo held her
glanda then beat her and poured large amounts of water down her throat until she died authorities said glanda ordered pecararo to have sex with her but he refused pecararo said
glanda is a court reporter who knows about dna evidence and was trying to frame pecararo briggs said dna evidence from sexual contact could identify the attacker
pecararo said he took the body to upper cascade lake in keene and dumped it and her ford explorer into the lake
kimberly musgrove testified she heard the splash when the explorer hit and kevin reynolds said he found mrs glanda's purse and some personal belongings on route 73 near where her body was found
the medical examiner couldn't estimate the moment of death but ruled that she died by being strangled and having water poured down her throat
briggs said pecararo testified because he felt guilty
the defendant could control nicholas pecararo's actions but could not control his soul briggs told the jury
briggs argued that glanda told hilborn and pecararo the same thing specifically that he wanted mrs glanda dead and it had to look like an accident to collect on the insurance money
glanda had taken out three insurance policies on his wife the last one 18 days before her death according to testimony the husband would have received $130000 through the policies
the prosecutor claimed glanda wanted to stop his wife from financially draining him in divorce which would hurt his affluent lifestyle the court stenographer was known for expensive tastes - a mercedes benz gold jewelry and an exclusive home in the olympic village
money is the oldest motive in the world briggs said
thursday state supreme court justice g thomas moynihan instructed the jury to ignore testimony from mrs glanda's divorce attorney william cantwell he had said he was working on custody papers for mrs glanda four weeks before his client's death
in court saturday glanda showed no facial reaction but swayed between his two defense attorneys as the jury foreman announced the verdict in the courtroom
mrs glanda's family held hands some quietly sobbing as the foreman responded guilty to five felony charges in addition to two counts of first-degree murder glanda was convicted of two counts of burglary and one count of conspiracy he was found not guilty of offering plattsburgh auto mechanic donald hilborn $10000 in 1996 to kill mrs glanda
outside the courtroom glanda maintained he was framed by briggs and state police
we'll all find out that briggs made deals lots of deals that's why the case went the way it did he said questioning why more investigators didn't testify what were they hiding
glanda said prosecutors wanted bigger fish to fry
from the get-go they were all jealous of me he said
the sentencing phase of mr glanda's trial will begin shortly jurors return feb 7 to decide whether mr glanda is sentenced to death or given life without parole
ohio state coach jim o'brien called it a classic big ten game others might have painted it in considerably less flattering terms
in a rough-and-tumble battle that saw players hitting the deck on a regular basis no 8 ohio state got six points from michael redd in a late 13-2 run to get by purdue 68-59 saturday night
every possession was like a war said scoonie penn who led ohio state 14-3 5-1 big ten with 19 points
with the buckeyes on top 48-46 with 841 left redd who finished with 14 points hit a shot from the lane after penn hit a foul shot redd scored inside and then hit a fastbreak layup off an alley-oop from penn
penn then added a layup of his own before george reese and ken johnson scored on rebound follows to put ohio state ahead 61-48 the lead never dropped below seven again
we were determined to buckle down in the second half and we finally made some shots said redd who had hit only 3-of-12 shots from the field before making three in a row
it's conceivable that he could go 0-for-15 and we'd still try to run something for him to win the game for us o'brien said when you have good players you ride your good players you can't get away from your good players michael and scoonie will continue to be the focus of our offense and we'll try to get them as many shots as we can
the win was the sixth in a row for ohio state which has won 10 of its last 11
play was stopped for 10 minutes in the second half while the officiating crew watched a video tape of the previous play
just after penn released a 3-pointer a whistle away from the ball sent brian brown to the line brown hit both free throws to give ohio state a 48-42 lead with 949 left
after purdue 13-7 4-3 inbounded and went through a sequence of its offense carson cunningham was fouled but before he could shoot the free throws the officials knelt around a courtside monitor for several minutes
a value city arena capacity crowd of 19100 booed and keady and o'brien paced the sidelines with exasperated expressions on their faces
the officials decided that reese not brown should have shot the foul shots at the other end brown's points were taken off the scoreboard and reese was sent to the line - 28 seconds having run off the clock since the earlier foul after reese made both cunningham then took his shots before play resumed
i'll have to see that on tape to really be sure purdue coach gene keady said a lot of times i think that was a really bad call probably about 80 percent of the time that i've thought that over the course of my 42 years in coaching the referee was right i'm not going to say he was wrong on that thing but it was weird
it was just a wash with a different shooter o'brien said
johnson the nation's leading shot blocker scored 10 points and had 10 rebounds to go with seven blocks reese added 10 points
cunningham matched his season high with 19 points with brian cardinal and greg mcquay each scoring 11 cardinal also had 11 rebounds
we just could not get over the hump keady said
jaraan cornell purdue's leading scorer with 151 points a game made his only field goal with 125 left and finished with two points
a year ago ohio state beat the boilermakers 72-43 - their most lopsided victory in the series in 38 years the latest meeting in columbus was considerably different
we beat a good team redd said i don't want anyone to listen to other people's expectations we just have to play the best that we can
purdue shot 382 percent from the field marking the fifth game in a row an ohio state opponent has failed to top 40 percent
gar heard's firing was determined well before tipoff but it turned out to be a somewhat fitting ending to a sloppy game between two bad teams
rod strickland had 26 points 11 assists and seven rebounds and rookie richmond hamilton scored a career-high 21 points saturday night as the washington wizards fumbled and bumbled their way to a 103-98 victory over the cleveland cavaliers
immediately after the game heard and two assistant coaches were fired the wizards' first major move since michael jordan became head of basketball operations golden state assistant rod higgins a former teammate of jordan's will be the new coach
it's a good win heard said i won my first game and my lost game tonight it was a good ride unfortunately i wasn't the guy they wanted here
washington is 14-30 and in last place in the atlantic division
things weren't going well around here so it's not a surprise to me wizards guard rod strickland said i hope this can make things better now we have another coach to get used to or whatever but things weren't going well i don't think it could get any worse
in a game between losing teams the wizards won primarily because they were slightly less bad than the cavaliers who have lost six straight on the road there were 29 turnovers a week's worth of missed layups and neither team played much defense
cleveland's shawn kemp had the most miserable game of all getting in foul trouble early and missing easy layups in the second half he had 14 points and 10 rebounds before fouling out with 338 to go
kemp drew two technicals protesting his sixth foul and had to be restrained as he left the court that gave the wizards four consecutive free throws they made three to build a 97-89 lead that helped make the difference
i'm not going to make it worse for myself and start talking about it kemp said everybody is disappointed with calls you just have to deal with it
the wizards still nearly blew it though as the cavaliers cut the lead to two twice in the final two minutes strickland saved the day with a prayer off the glass as the shot clock expired and a rebound off bob sura's missed jumper in the final minute
sura had 23 points to lead the cavaliers
for much of the game each team seemed determined to play as poorly as the other to keep the score close down 61-50 in the third quarter the wizards loped along on a 17-2 run that contained some sequences that threatened to set the game back a couple of decades
kemp couldn't finish a simple layup on a fast break jahidi white was called for his fourth foul for a trying to get rebounding position on a made free throw kemp got poked in the eye and couldn't see for a few seconds yet he took an outside jumper anyway and badly missed juwan howard couldn't finish a dunk with only token body contact from kemp there were also sloppy turnovers at midcourt
the difference in the game was the play at the start and at the beginning of the third coach randy wittman said i thought in both we were lackadaisical and ultimately it cost us the game
the wizards improved to 2-3 since jordan joined the team as part-owner head of basketball operations and occasional practice partner jordan missed the game because he is in atlanta for the super bowl
with kemp in early foul trouble sura carried the load in the first quarter for the cavaliers with nine points in a 13-2 run cleveland committed 10 first-half turnovers but made up for it by outrebounding washington 27-18 to take a 54-49 lead at the half
texas a&ampm's leading rusher sophomore fullback ja'mar toombs was arrested early saturday by college station police and charged with driving while intoxicated
the 6-foot 265-pound toombs was a star of the aggies' emotional 20-16 victory over texas in november he rushed 37 times for 126 yards and scored twice
toombs who was a high school all-american in kilgore texas was released from jail on $1500 bail police said
toombs had three passengers in his car when he was pulled over for a traffic violation shortly after midnight friday college station police sgt donny andreski said
after failing field sobriety tests toombs was taken into custody and a breathalyzer test indicated a blood alcohol level of 10 andreski said the legal alcohol limit in texas is 08
athletic director wally groff and football coach rc slocum who attended a&ampm's annual football banquet saturday night declined to speculate on how the arrest will affect toombs' status with the team
frankly i'm disappointed in the fact that he was picked up groff told the bryan-college station eagle we'll check into it and see what we'll do at the proper time
slocum said it always concerns you if there's any involvement in something like that i just found out about it i will withhold any comment until i find out more about it
toombs just completed his sophomore season and has two years of eligibility remaining he was a&ampm's leading rusher this season with 147 carries for 583 yards and nine touchdowns he also caught nine passes for 128 yards and one touchdown
toombs was arrested in may on a charge of possession of marijuana he was placed on deferred adjudication and was ordered to perform community service under deferred adjudication with good behavior a conviction can be eventually removed from a person's record
cedric ceballos scored 25 of his 31 points in the first half as dallas beat denver 107-96 on saturday night extending the mavericks' winning streak to four games
ceballos was 11-for-19 from the field hit all six free throws and added 10 rebounds as the mavericks put together their first four-game winning streak since 1994-95
erick strickland added 15 points and steve nash had 12 for the mavericks who have won seven of their last nine for their most successful stretch since taking nine of 10 in 1994-95
nuggets forward antonio mcdyess went scoreless for the first time in his career playing a career-low seven minutes due to tendinitis in his right knee mcdyess had gone 90 consecutive games scoring in double figures the second-longest streak in the league
dallas finished with an 8-5 record for january the mavericks' last winning january was 9-7 in 1990
bryant stith had a season-high 27 points for the nuggets who have lost seven of their last nine james posey added 15 points
the nuggets made a late run closing within 100-94 with 494 seconds to play on popeye jones' 3-pointer
but the mavericks made seven of eight free throws in the final minute to close out the nuggets
dallas charged to a 28-10 lead after the first quarter in denver's lowest scoring quarter of the season
the mavericks padded their advantage to as much as 47-21 with 430 left until the intermission at that point ceballos had outscored the entire denver team 23-21
dallas went on to a 58-37 halftime lead after denver missed 14 of its first 17 field goal attempts
the nuggets reduced the deficit to 69-56 with 536 left in the third period on consecutive jumpers by nick van exel
but the mavericks finished the quarter with a 18-5 spurt led by michael finley's seven points to take an 87-61 lead into the final quarter

the second ice storm in a week made highways treacherous saturday leaving the pavement so slippery in places people couldn't stand let alone drive
cars slid into police cars and trucks trying to clear the roads and ice-covered overpasses and interchanges were shut down across the state
it just happened so suddenly said state department of transportation spokeswoman kim law you look out your window and not see any ice on the trees and assume it's ok well it's anything but
another storm earlier in the week had knocked out electrical service to thousands of customers across the southeast in north carolina about 500 customers were still without power saturday as state emergency management officials prepared for another blast as the storm moved up the east coast
more than 20000 homes lost power as the latest storm moved through georgia icy roads were blamed for a 47-car pileup at the junction of two interstates in downtown atlanta and 12-car pileup on an interstate a few hours later two deaths in the state were also blamed on the ice
we've had vehicles slide into 10 of our officer's cars said dekalb county police spokeswoman mikki jones everyone needs to slow down we're seeing people try to drive 70 miles an hour on the interstate
three multi-car pileups were reported on interstates and highways in the charlotte nc area saturday evening charlotte-mecklenburg police began asking drivers to stay off the roads
unlike last week's storm which dropped 20 inches of snow in parts of north carolina with little warning state emergency operations were prepared for the worst
we've got everybody here bill figulski said from the state emergency operations center in raleigh nc everything's set in place we're just going to sit back now and see what happens
about 1100 national guard personnel were ready to respond to emergencies during and after the storm with four-wheel drive vehicles cargo trucks and emergency fuel trailers set up at five locations across the state
storm advisories were posted across south and north carolina where residents were still digging out after last week's record snowfall the national weather service was forecasting accumulations of as much as a half inch of ice in parts of south carolina by sunday
freezing rain and sleet had already glazed roads in southern west virginia by saturday evening in northeastern alabama and ice storm warning remained in effect and in arkansas ice and snow still covered many roads and highways and the freezing temperatures were expected to continue into sunday
a few days earlier the same storm dropped more than a foot of snow in areas across the plains and the south and was blamed for three deaths in arkansas one in louisiana and five in missouri a 14-year-old boy died in a sledding accident near memphis tenn
rick cantrell and john schifko hoped to see atlanta's sights after driving from st louis for the super bowl but watching drivers not used to ice trying to maneuver on the slick pavement made them think again
this is child's play compared to what we get in st louis but the worst hazard is everyone else cantrell said we saw people going too fast on the interstate and spin out left and right
the storm also iced roads in kentucky on saturday forcing police to close a 10-mile section of interstate it's utter chaos this morning brother said state police sgt russ harney in richmond
in lexington ky ken kurtz 70 and his wife were out shopping when the sleet began
we hit the parking lot with clear windows and by the time we came out 25 minutes later every window was coated with ice kurtz said
temperatures in the 40s were forecast for super bowl sunday in atlanta

aids has quietly caused the deaths of hundreds of roman catholic priests in the united states although other causes may be listed on some of their death certificates the kansas city star reported in its sunday editions
in the first of a three-part series the newspaper reported that its examination of death certificates and interviews with experts indicated several hundred priests had died of aids-related illnesses since the mid-1980s and hundreds more are living with hiv the virus that causes the disease the death rate of priests from aids is at least four times that of the general population the newspaper said
church leaders in the united states and at the vatican declined requests to discuss the findings the star said and the vatican referred questions to local bishops
bishop raymond j boland of the diocese of kansas city-st joseph said the aids deaths show that priests are human much as we would regret it it shows that human nature is human nature boland said
the star sent confidential questionnaires to 3000 of the 46000 priests in the united states last fall asking about aids and other issues and received responses from 801 priests a 27 percent return rate
six of 10 priests responding said they knew of at least one priest who had died of an aids-related illness and one-third knew a priest living with aids three-fourths said the church needed to provide more education to seminarians on sexual issues
asked about their sexual orientation 75 percent said they were heterosexual 15 percent said they were homosexual and 5 percent said they were bisexual
the star said exact numbers of priests who have died of aids or become infected with hiv is unknown partly because many suffer in solitude when priests tell their superiors the cases generally are handled quietly
the newspaper cited the case of bishop emerson j moore who left the archdiocese of new york in 1995 and went to minnesota where he died in a hospice of an aids-related illness his death certificate attributed the death to unknown natural causes and listed his occupation as laborer in the manufacturing industry
after an aids activist filed a complaint officials changed the cause of death to hiv-related illness the newspaper reported but the occupation was not corrected
farley cleghorn an epidemiologist with the institute of human virology in baltimore said he has treated about 20 priests and religious-order brothers with aids all of whom had kept it a secret
the church and religious orders need to acknowledge that there is a problem - that priests have sex and they are susceptible to all sexually transmitted diseases including aids he said

thomas tied it at 632 when he flipped mats sundin's pass over fiset
i've maintained a good work ethic and good things were bound to happen thomas said i've been in the right place at the right time lately and maybe this will lead to a good second half
i can't question the effort of our team los angeles coach andy murray said we played hard and worked hard and we got what we deserve eventually things will start to go our way
bryan smolinski and jere karalahti scored in the first period for the kings

turgeon third in the nhl with 58 points has 23 goals and 35 assists he was selected to the north american all-star squad earlier this month for the all-star game feb 6 at toronto

any more games like this and alex jensen may finally realize how good he is
the unselfish self-effacing jensen made a 3-point basket and a three-point play in the final 38 seconds rallying no 19 utah to a 64-63 victory over stubborn air force on saturday night
no one ever has to tell me how good alex can be and is utah coach rick majerus said basically i've spent my whole life telling the kid he's good and he looks at me as though i don't know what i'm talking about al has utah jazz guard john stockton's disease he's unselfish to a fault
he did a wonderful job tonight
at the finish instead of dishing to his teammates jensen took charge
al knew he had to look for a shot majerus said he knows hanno mottola is out of the game
mottola utah's top player fouled out with 49 seconds left
i knew i had to shoot it the 3-pointer without hesitating because we were down and there was not a lot of time left jensen said maybe even a year ago i wouldn't have tried to be as aggressive at the end this was a game we were fortunate to get away with a win
falcons coach reggie minton said his players played their hearts out we just slipped up at the end we didn't want to give up a 3 or a three-point play that's what we were preaching jensen is a wily veteran and a tremendous player
majerus said his team never gave up we never quit and neither did air force what a shame that only 2100 people saw this game because it was a hell of a game
the utes 16-3 5-0 mountain west built an 11-point lead midway through the second half and then saw air force erase it with a 15-4 run

air force nearly lost the ball twice on its last possession the falcons set up an inbounds play with 21 seconds left but freshman vernard jenkins missed a 16-footer as time expired
asked if he had control of the ball on his final shot jenkins said not really because when i caught it they came around me and hit the ball from the back i still had a good enough look to make it though it just didn't go in
jensen finished with 20 points and nine rebounds tony harvey added 12 points and mottola who played only 24 minutes because of foul trouble and a hyperextended left elbow had 10 points
wright scored 20 points for the falcons and croff had 19

wright had 10 of the falcons' 15 points during their furious comeback and croff hit two 3-pointers down the stretch
with mottola playing only nine minutes of the first half because of foul trouble air force fashioned an 8-0 run to take a 23-18 lead with 318 left

after a 23-footer by taylor put the clippers up by three marbury swung an errant pass toward kittles which he wrestled out of anderson's hands before hitting a 19-footer that trimmed the deficit to 94-93 with 22 seconds to go
but anderson coming off a career-high 35-point effort on thursday night at dallas sank both free throws after an intentional foul by johnny newman with 16 seconds left
new jersey had one more chance for a game-tying 3-pointer but odom forced a turnover by marbury from behind the arc and tyrone nesby clinched it with a slam dunk off odom's alley-oop pass in the final two seconds
the nets capped an 11-0 run with consecutive 3-pointers by kittles and scott burrell and two free throws by marbury turning an eight-point deficit into a 64-61 lead with 120 left in the third quarter

four cars of a chicago-bound amtrak train derailed in southwest pennsylvania on saturday night emergency officials said

the train was outbound from washington dc
skipper paul cayard was emphatic a bad call ruined a good race for americaone but don't count him out yet
the american boat lost race 4 of the america's cup challenger finals sunday when it was penalized as it held a small lead about a minute from the end for blocking prada of italy
americaone crossed the finish line a half boat length ahead of prada but had to make a 270-degree penalty turn that gave prada a 2-minute 32-second victory and a 3-1 lead in the best-of-9 series
prada raised a protest flag and umpires in a nearby boat agreed that americaone the windward boat prevented prada the leeward boat from sailing the proper course to the mark as americaone was required by the rules to do but cayard said prada already was off its proper course
they've done an awesome job cayard said of the umpires today we disagreed with the call it was a quick call for a big-money race and it shuffled the deck big time that's all right we don't mind 3-1
there is no appeal process for calls made on the water
he was trying to sail below and squeeze us to the mark and we just stayed on course prada tactician torben grael said
cayard must win four of a possible five races to advance to the best-of-9 america's cup final starting feb 19 against defending champion new zealand race 5 is scheduled for tuesday
each of us is going to win some races that we didn't expect to win and each of us is going to lose some races that we didn't expect to lose he said that probably happened a little bit on both boats today
americaone had come back from serious boat damage that forced it to withdraw from saturday's third race it led all the way sunday until the penalty turn
americaone led by 41 seconds going into the final 3 1/4-mile leg of the six-leg 18 1/2-mile race in varying conditions - strong winds approaching 25 knots sunny skies and a brief downpour that limited visibility
then prada skipper francesco de angelis started closing in as he positioned his boat behind cayard's to block the wind coming from behind from cayard's sails
with the finish line about 60 seconds away prada sailing on the left headed toward americaone which was coming at an angle from the right their spinnakers sails at the front of the boat used on downwind legs seemed to touch and the italians immediately raised a protest flag
cayard made a poor gybe and the boats separated as both sailed straight ahead toward the finish line americaone's bow crossed first but the umpires in a nearby boat upheld prada's protest
the american boat plagued by equipment problems saturday was done in by human error sunday
we did a much better job today and were looking good for a while cayard said
for most of the race it appeared cayard's sailing skill would overcome the latest mishap - its eighth lost spinnaker in 44 races throughout the trials and second in two days
a cool cayard sailed an aggressive and masterful second leg after the lime-green sail broke loose from its pole
cayard won race 2 despite having a spinnaker rip across the bottom the spinnaker damage in race 3 on saturday was more costly as the sail snapped in two horizontally on the fourth leg
the boat's rigging also suffered substantial damage in the strong winds and high waves and cayard fearing his mast would break withdrew on the fifth leg for sunday's race he had substituted the mast from his backup boat
yesterday saturday we just had a lot of things go against us cayard said we hadn't raced in 30 knots before the italians had because they had been in new zealand longer than americaone
the winds were strong again although not reaching the 30 knots of saturday cayard led by four seconds at the start and eight seconds after the first leg going into the wind
then the hauraki gulf turned into the scene of furious combat as both boats had sail problems and raised protest flags that were disallowed by the umpires
about halfway up the three-mile downwind run americaone's spinnaker came loose and remained attached only at the top
a luffing duel ensued in which the leading boat maneuvers in attempt to keep its opponent's sail from filling properly it worked for cayard as he tacked several times and stretched his lead even though he had no spinnaker
they were very lucky that their spinnaker broke again grael said because then it was easier for them to luff
americaone gained 31 seconds on the leg and as the crisis passed cayard took a deep breath and a drink from a water bottle the heavy rain returned on the third leg and americaone increased its lead to 54 seconds at the midpoint prada started chipping away trailing by 47 seconds and 41 seconds after the next two legs

now having come through an ordeal of self-denial that most people cannot even imagine they face an even tougher challenge keeping the weight off
it's one of the hardest things i do in this program is the day-in and day-out maintenance said lynne cassidy who lost 85 pounds in the hmr-uk program in 1988 and now serves as the program's coordinator
however a new study by dr james anderson the program's director and a professor of clinical nutrition at the university of kentucky suggests that patients who particpate in very low-calorie diets and in follow-up classes like tighe's fare significantly better than other dieters in the battle to maintain weight loss
in an article published in december in the journal of the american college of nutrition anderson reported on a follow-up study of 112 people who entered the uk-hmr program in 1989 and 1990 and stayed with it through at least 12 weeks of rapid weight loss after more than five years of follow-up he wrote patients maintained an average of nearly 23 percent of their initial weight loss
that may not sound like much but consider that national health authorities at the federal food and drug administration and the national institutes of health judge a weight-loss treatment to be successful if participants maintain a loss of 5 percent of their initial body weight by this standard 40 percent of the individuals studied by anderson achieved success after five years
at seven years 25 percent of the people studied had successfully maintained a weight loss of at least 10 percent of their initial body weight
i think our data points out that many people are keeping the weight off long-term anderson said not everyone's being successful but people are being successful
anderson said his results at least point toward a solution to what he terms an epidemic of american obesity that is fueling increased rates of diabetes hypertension and coronary heart disease according to anderson more than half of american adults are overweight and obesity is responsible for more than 300000 early deaths in the united states each year
hmr currently contracts with the university of kentucky and more than 400 other medical institutions around the country to provide medically-supervised weight management programs the programs can cost up to $400 a month for shakes and low-calorie meals blood tests and medical supervision they frequently are not covered by health insurance plans
however programs like anderson's are often the only choice for severely overweight patients
if someone needs to lose 80 pounds and they lose a pound a week they'll have to diet for 80 weeks that's more than a year and a half anderson said that's very hard to do so we think it's better to bite the bullet and go on if you will starvation rations under medical supervision
that's what 43-year-old janet whitaker a producer at the kentucky public television network ket did in october 1998 breaking an unhealthy cycle of stress-fueled junk food consumption by enrolling in the uk-hmr program
i never really got the concept of healthy eating whitaker recalled
she lost 35 pounds in the program and now is in maintenance last fall she ran a 5-kilometer road race something she never would have dreamed of 15 months ago
weekly attendance at follow-up classes like the one taught by tracy tighe is crucial to keep the weight off whitaker said
i like it she said i like the people i went through it with
the classes are more than a support group however the petite energetic tighe is more coach than cheerleader holding her students accountable in their efforts to comply with the program's triple imperative for maintaining weight loss at least 2000 calories of physical activity a week at least five servings of fruits and vegetables a day and consumption of at least 14 meal-replacement shakes a week
careful planning is essential to preventing weight gain tighe tells the class they must plan days when they will undereat make sure they empty their homes of unhealthy foods and keep enough meal-replacement shakes and fruits and vegetables at hand
for these dieters eliminating choices about what to eat is key after the class tighe discusses what she and her students call the gap - the chasm between the lifestyle that uk-hmr are patients are trying to lead and the daily temptations offered by america's drive-thru super-sized deep-fried culture
cassidy mentions that the big offer at burger king this week is two whoppers for $2 you don't see them offering two bunches of broccoli for $2 she jokes
female athletes face a far higher risk than do men of ripping their knee tendons and a study indicates female hormones may be a reason why
the test-tube experiment found that tissue from the knee's anterior cruciate ligament grew less well when estrogen was added the study was intended to help explain why women have four to six times the risk that men face but the report is creating arguments among scientists
that study doesn't mean anything said dr elizabeth a arendt of the university of minnesota who said the lab work was too limited she also rejected the idea that estrogen can weaken the knee
certainly the hormone we believe is influential said dr stephen liu of ucla medical center who was one of the researchers
other factors also doubtless play a role but this study and others argue that estrogen does weaken the ligament that helps to bind the upper and lower leg bones together liu said
the findings are in the journal clinical orthopedics and related research the abstract appeared on the national library of medicine's medline web site
in the study 17 beta-estradiol a form of estrogen was added to fibroblasts the cells that produce collagen which makes up the tough tissue of the ligament researchers found fibroblasts grew at a lower rate in the first three days of the experiment and that growth was even slower in the presence of more estrogen the effect eased as the 14-day experiment continued
the cells have estrogen receptors and estrogen apparently binded to the receptors liu said when you find receptors on a tissue they have to have some effect or they would not be present he said our study shows it decreased collagen buildup
the trouble comes in taking this test-tube finding to the next step - increased acl damage in women at the time in their menstrual cycle when they have more estrogen
we have a fair amount of interesting information but nothing that really explains in a convincing way why women are more at risk than men said dr gerald a finerman chairman of ucla's orthopedic surgery department and senior author of the paper
this may be because it would take a lot of work to get enough blood samples over enough time from enough women liu said
arendt doubts the data ever will come estrogen might well affect the ligament but the hormone might well the ligament she said estrogen is necessary for the good function of every other tissue she said why would the ligament be the poor sucker it is not good for
the joint-loosening effect of estrogen has a purpose although not in the knee liu said especially in the pelvis the looser joints in pregnant women make delivery easier an effect of estrogen on the knee would be sort of a side effect he said
but other researchers have come up with other possible reasons for women's higher risk these include women's weaker muscles as well as male-female skeletal differences women can reduce their risk by developing greater muscle control and better balance arendt said and researchers should spend more time looking into those strategies she said

da pennebaker still remembers the look on young bob dylan's face the 26-year-old singer was watching himself in pennebaker's soon-to-be released documentary don't look back
dylan appeared well stunned is a good word
i think the first time he saw it he went into shock pennebaker recalls laughing slightly he had no idea that one camera sitting on one guy's shoulder could make him feel so naked
the chastened dylan returned a night later watched it again then gave his ok to pennebaker's film now three decades later the director's chronicle of dylan's three-week 1965 british tour returns this month in an enhanced dvd version released by new video
i've always admired dylan for letting the film go the way it was pennebaker says that was something a lot of lesser talents - and a lot of greater talents - would have had trouble doing
pennebaker's critically-acclaimed documentary released in 1967 stands the test of time - although its creator once felt the 96-minute film would never see a theatrical release
it was the kindness of several west coast pornographic theaters that changed that he says - in particular the presidio in san francisco
this group of western theaters was showing porno and they wanted to upgrade their act the self-deprecating pennebaker recalls it was perfect for me because my movie looked like porno but it's not
pennebaker who earned an academy award nomination for his look at the clinton presidential campaign in the war room is quick to poke fun at himself talking about his acclaimed black and white dylan piece he describes it as a very ratty-looking film
critics disagreed
a portrait of the young dylan tearing the pop world apart a san francisco examiner reviewer enthused in a typical rave
pennebaker an illinois native earned a degree in mechanical engineering at yale before going into filmmaking using his college skills pennebaker developed a portable camera that allowed filmmakers full access - one of the keys to the cinema verite style that he helped define
according to pennebaker the movie wasn't his idea and it wasn't dylan's either the credit belongs to dylan's late manager albert grossman
i probably couldn't have convinced dylan myself pennebaker says he was mercurial it would be hard to convince him of anything for three hours in a row but albert grossman asked me if i wanted to do a film with one of his clients
pennebaker knew little about his subject who wore his hair long his sunglasses dark and his attitude on his sleeve i didn't have much of a take on him i knew who he was probably heard a couple of his songs to hear him sing the first time he wasn't rudy vallee i was less than swept away
that soon changed
pennebaker watching through his lens saw an amazing prodigy very smart in an untutored way he created his own persona right before your eyes he was a compendium of things it takes professors years to figure out - startlingly naive but smart
the 74-year-old pennebaker acknowledges that he had 40 to 50 extra hours of footage from the dylan sessions and that the idea of recutting his movie flashed through his brain
i thought about it he says i thought  this is a chance to make a new film' then i thought why a new film what would that get us' it would be interesting to people who'll take any dylan you can give them but not to a major audience
the extra footage along with outtakes and originals of all pennebaker's work such as monterey pop and the war room now sits in the archives of the museum of modern art
the film's title appears in a line from dylan's song she belongs to me she's an artist she don't look back
yet pennebaker says the credit for his title actually goes to negro leagues star and hall of famer satchel paige who once advised don't look back it might be gaining on you
pennebaker offers his own tip on staying a step or two ahead of the audience the one barometer i believe in is boredom the minute people start to lose interest that's it
that explains the tight running time of don't look back barely an hour and half
the dvd comes with a bonus - five never before released dylan audio performances and a previously unreleased version of the landmark cue-card flipping bit for subterranean homesick blues
pennebaker's grainy video for the dylan tune turned out to be about 20 years ahead of its time presaging mtv and vh1 so when he flips past the video music channels today
i think without me they'd be bankrupt' he says laughing loudly i'm sure the check is in the mail
andrew cuomo has been in the crosshairs before
with his new york liberal roots his combative style and his penchant for publicity the federal housing secretary has long been a lightning rod for the gop he's even managed to rub some of his fellow democrats the wrong way
now cuomo's in the fray again this time in the middle of a fierce partisan battle that almost everyone agrees has as much to do with new york's high-stakes us senate race between hillary rodham clinton and rudolph giuliani as it does with housing policy
senate republicans will grill cuomo's department of housing and urban development at a hearing next month house hearings could follow
the republican onslaught also comes as cuomo the eldest son of former gov mario cuomo makes his loudest rumblings yet that he's interested in running for his father's old job
it's a partisan witch hunt rep jerrold nadler d-manhattan said the republicans are after cuomo because of hillary they're after him because he's a democrat they're after him because his last name is cuomo
at the heart of the flap is the decision of cuomo an ally of the first lady to yank some $60 million in us homeless funds from giuliani cuomo said he had to take control of the money because of a court decision saying the new york city mayor withheld it improperly from housing works a nonprofit group that has tussled with giuliani over his policies on the homeless and aids
republicans cried politics and rallied around giuliani sen christopher bond r-mo announced he would hold a hearing on the matter in february bond denies politics is involved and says he simply wants a detailed explanation of why cuomo took control of the money
he says his repeated written requests for information from hud have been met with reams of paper outlining every law congress has written dealing with hud a response he described as woefully inadequate
there is even talk in some republican circles of calling mrs clinton's campaign manager bill de blasio to testify at the senate hearing de blasio had been cuomo's head of hud operations in new york before leaving to head mrs clinton's campaign
the new york senate race has moved to washington lamented rep charles rangel the harlem democrat who is dean of new york's 31-member congressional delegation
bond's spokesman dan hubbard would say only that no decision had been made yet on who would be asked to participate in the hearing
on a recent trip to upstate new york where cuomo shed his urban image and donned camouflage gear to hunt pheasants with a 12-gauge shotgun the housing secretary brushed aside the storm brewing miles away in washington
this is all hillary clinton politics it's about democrats and republicans about clinton and cuomo he said it's the political silly season
on that trip upstate cuomo made it clear that he is interested in running for governor cuomo is most often mentioned as front-runner for white house chief of staff if his friend al gore wins the presidency and conventional wisdom has held that he would only seek the governor's post if gore lost but cuomo said on that trip that he might run for governor in 2002 no matter what the outcome of the presidential contest
that could pit him against state comptroller h carl mccall in a democratic primary mccall the first black elected to statewide office in new york is already lining up support prompting some cuomo supporters to urge democrats to hold off making commitments in the race still some two years away
polls show cuomo making a respectable showing against republican gov george pataki one recent poll had him trailing pataki 53 percent to 38 percent
some grumble that cuomo's tenure as hud secretary has all been in preparation for a run for governor even cuomo supporters say he has used the everyday distribution of hud money as a way to get himself in the news in new york he has made frequent appearances doling out federal funds along the economically depressed erie canal corridor
in fact republicans became so upset by cuomo's using hud events for public relations that last year they led a successful push in congress to hand control over $60 million in federal small cities money from cuomo to pataki
democrats will almost certainly rally around cuomo in bond's hearings many view hud as the only federal agency devoted to serving the needs of the poor and say that is the reason it has been subjected to gop attacks
it doesn't fit into the republican agenda rangel said
but numerous congressional staffers said privately that cuomo's relations with new york's democratic delegation can be frosty
one example of the seeming ambivalence about cuomo comes from sen charles schumer d-ny while schumer has said he is opposed to partisan hearings he also says that a closer look should be taken at federal decisions to seize control from local governments
but for cuomo having the gop klieg lights trained on him may not be all bad nadler predicted the tactic would backfire against the republicans and giuliani
it just gives him a platform to say why he doesn't trust giuliani nadler said i don't understand what the republicans think they'll accomplish i think they end up looking foolish
french conglomerate vivendi sa and anglo-american telecommunications giant vodafone airtouch plc said sunday that they will set up a 50-50 multi-access european internet portal and cooperate in mobile and fixed line telecommunications
the vivendi-vodafone alliance is conditional on the success of vodafone's $170 billion hostile bid for germany's mannesmann vodafone chief executive officer chris gent said at a joint news conference with vivendi chairman jean-marie messier
messier said the venture provisionally named map for multi-access portal will allow vivendi's and vodafone's 70 million pay-television mobile and fixed-line telecommunications customers access to content on the world wide web
this is the most compelling alliance of the internet age in europe and beyond messier said adding that the map venture is potentially worth tens of billions of dollars
gent and messier said they will also consider a stock exchange listing for map
this is another important step in achieving our objective to become the world's leading mobile multimedia operator gent said
if vodafone wins more than 50 percent control of mannesmann gent said it will sell a 75 percent interest in french telecommunications company cegetel to vivendi at a fair price
we will thus put our equity holding in cegetel in accordance with our management rights messier said
vivendi has an indirect 44 percent stake in cegetel france's no 2 mobile phone operator mannesmann has a 15 percent share
in germany a mannesmann spokesman declined to comment on the vodafone-vivendi link
vivendi and vodafone will consider potential cooperation in fixed line telecommunications through their existing operations in france germany and italy gent said
sunday's pact is a blow for mannesmann which as late as saturday was still pushing for its own alliance with vivendi on media and telecommunications projects in europe vivendi's board met saturday to discuss a potential link with mannesmann and messier confirmed that vivendi had considered a full merger with the german company
but messier said he chose vodafone instead because the british company offers the best solutions for helping vivendi save as much as three years in bringing new internet services to market
gent said later in a conference call with journalists that the deal underpins the logic of vodafone's bid for mannesmann the bid closes feb 7
what it says is they vivendi think we're going to win  gent said everyone was focusing on mannesmann doing a deal with vivendi but i think they liked our approach in terms of partnership
gent said he has not yet discussed the vivendi deal with mannesmann chief executive klaus esser he confirmed that vodafone is prepared to make a modest increase in the bid if esser agrees to back vodafone
messier said at the news conference that he is convinced vodafone will succeed in taking over mannesmann
the alliance with vodafone he added would not prevent vivendi from bidding for british mobile phone operator orange which mannesmann took over last year helping spark vodafone's hostile bid
if it wins control of mannesmann vodafone will spin off orange to meet competition concerns
despite the euro hitting record lows against the dollar european central bank chief wim duisenberg said sunday he is satisfied with the performance of europe's single currency because it has delivered stable prices
our main purpose is to deliver a climate of stable prices and that is what we have done and what we have achieved duisenberg said in a british broadcasting corp television interview
that the exchange rate has fallen somewhat is of course of much less significance now for the euro area in total than it was in the past for the individual countries because foreign trade imports or exports only represents about 16 to 17 percent of the euro area gdp he added
the euro has fallen 14 percent against the dollar since it was adopted by 11 of the 15 member-nations of the european union including france and germany in january last year
on friday the euro hit 9762 cents slumping to a record low for the second straight day after stronger than expected economic growth was reported in the united states
duisenberg said that compared with 1997-98 the euro had only fallen 5 or 6 percent against the dollar and that was because europe was emerging from recession while us growth continued at a surprisingly fast pace
the divergence in economic development is already disappearing and it will disappear totally in our expectation and then the euro will show its strength said duisenberg we do believe we honestly believe that the euro has a potential to increase its value
french finance minister christian sautter said saturday he hopes currency markets will soon take notice of economic recovery in the 11 countries that have switched to the euro that performance isn't perceived sufficiently he told executives and politicians gathered here
sooner or later it should return to a level that is compatible with the strength of the euro zone sautter said
duisenberg said british membership of the euro was years away because of differences between the british and continental european economies
i mean if ever the united kingdom were to decide to join you are talking about a moment in time which is years from today said duisenberg
he said he believed it would be in britain's interests to adopt the euro but it is up to the people of britain to come to the same conclusion
british prime minister tony blair's labor party government says it will decide in principle whether to adopt the euro soon after national elections which must be held by 2002
demand for one brand of the pill is soaring but not for the reason you think
sales of johnson &amp johnson's ortho tri-cyclen have tripled in the last three years - making it by far the no 1 brand - because it is the only oral contraceptive that can also be sold as an acne fighter
while medical ethicists doubt the double-duty pill is encouraging more young girls to have sex one says it may help them provide a smokescreen to their parents - allowing them to claim they want the drug for their acne when their real aim is protection from pregnancy
sex and lying have a long history of association said arthur caplan director of the center for bioethics at the university of pennsylvania
the trend thrills family planning advocates who welcome anything that drives more women to use birth control to prevent unwanted pregnancies
anything that promotes the pill in a positive light is good for all of us said katie kralovetz a nurse practitioner with planned parenthood of wisconsin
family planning advocates for years have tried to promote the lesser-known health benefits of the pill such as reducing the risk of ovarian cancer and lessening menstrual cramps but none has drawn as much attention as the pill's effect on acne
it's like getting two drugs in one said darla brown 28 of houston whose been on the pill for two years and it has worked wonders on my skin
about 15 million us women currently use oral contraceptives the most popular form of reversible birth control
the food and drug administration gave j&ampj the right to sell ortho tri-cyclen for acne in 1997 after studies found it helped clear the skin of more than 80 percent of women who took it the studies showed the pill decreased hormone levels that trigger acne
although health experts say all oral contraceptives probably help fight acne only ortho tri-cyclen has fda clearance to advertise the added benefit
that labeling difference has helped johnson &amp johnson to control about 40 percent of the oral contraceptive market up from 30 percent in 1997
sales of ortho tri-cyclen have risen from 330000 prescriptions per month in january 1997 to 12 million last november according to ims health a market data firm
the brand has leapfrogged from fourth place to first while sales of rival pills including other j&ampj brands have largely been flat since 1997
j&ampj has exploited the pill's pimple-fighting ability with ads in leading women's magazines showing close ups of gorgeous models promoting ortho tri-cyclen as beauty aid for women 15 and over
ortho tri-cyclen now outsells its closest competitor - american home products' triphasil - by a more than 2-to-1 margin
j&ampj said the pill is still primarily for contraception though executives acknowledge some doctors may prescribe it mainly for acne on women who don't respond to ointments
just 1 percent of prescriptions for ortho tri-cyclen come from dermatologists said j&ampj spokesman mark monseau
ashley wesson 21 a college student in central texas said she asked her doctor last month if she could try the pill to help fight her acne she was not looking for birth control
already i've noticed small differences in how quickly my face heals she said
nick acocella's passion is hardball whether practiced by willie mays or christie whitman
an author of 13 baseball books acocella now reports on the new jersey governor and other politicians for readers of his weekly newsletter politifax he says baseball and new jersey politics have much in common
they're the two best spectator sports in america he says they are both incomprehensible to the outsider did you ever try to explain baseball to a european they look at you like you're crazy try and explain new jersey politics to somebody
acocella 56 knocks out his four-page newsletter each week in his home office in hoboken it is transmitted to a mainframe computer in california which blast-faxes it to political connoisseurs in new jersey and washington
the newsletter is a weekly mix of news and analysis humor and rumor
acocella chronicled the early 1999 trips to texas by delegations of republican leaders to pledge their support for george w bush for president
he wrote that whitman's decision to abandon her senate candidacy gives credence to the persistent rumors that it was her husband who thought a senate run was a great idea and that she was uncomfortable with it from the start
he began by focusing on statewide politics but increasingly plucks nuggets from towns and counties
he recently wrote about westfield councilman neil sullivan missing an opportunity to appear on the television show who wants to be a millionaire because his political opponent would not waive his right to equal time on the network
acocella was in a way born into politics he entered the world at margaret hague maternity hospital the jersey city health care center built by legendary democratic boss frank hague and named for his mother
as a baseball fan growing up in west new york nj acocella rooted for the new york yankees but also admired willie mays who played for his father's favorite team the new york giants
beginning in 1970 he wrote or co-wrote 13 books on baseball including the ball clubs a history of every major league team active and defunct he wrote travel pieces for fodor's and restaurant reviews for airline magazines
from 1982 to 1992 he worked as national director of operations for the news election service now the voter news service a consortium of news outlets that counts votes and declares winners on election nights
he talked and talked about his desire to write about new jersey politics finally a friend of mine said to me i'm tired of listening to this either do it or shut up'
the inaugural politifax appeared on fax machines throughout the garden state two weeks before the 1997 primary
it started very slowly acocella says people were wondering who is this lunatic and very very slowly as the number of sources grew the stories got better and more varied and the subscriptions grew
he won't say how many people pay the $219 annual subscription but says the newsletter is meeting the goals he set for it
every wednesday acocella's latest work emerges on fax machines in new jersey and washington subscribers include new jersey's two senators nine of 13 house members as well as lobbyists political analysts and reporters
copies also go to two other writers in the family acocella's ex-wife joan a staff writer at the new yorker and son bart chief speech writer for us agriculture secretary dan glickman
politics is his current stock in trade but his interest in that other brand of hardball brought acocella some celebrity over the holidays he appeared as an analyst and baseball historian in 12 episodes of espn's series on the greatest athletes of the century
he can't help but boast about the episode on joe dimaggio it included commentary by acocella and snippets from dimaggio's ex-wife marilyn monroe
i was in the same tv show as marilyn monroe he raves i consider that the greatest thing i have ever achieved
betsy reed knows firsthand how difficult it is to find jobs for disabled new jerseyans who want and can perform them
she also knows how important it is to help them retain those long-sought jobs once they get them
that's why reed an employment counselor for an atlantic county-based agency for the disabled appreciates gov christie whitman's new budget proposal appropriating $13 million for programs such as hers
i think it's great any help they can get is so worthwhile said reed who helped one blind client land a restaurant job peeling carrots and potatoes seeing people get and keep a job they feel much more independent
reed acts as a job coach steering her disabled clients toward receptive employers once a job is secured she makes sure the match remains successful
for example the restaurant owner who hired her blind client wanted him to punch a clock but he was unable a fellow employee volunteered to fill out the man's time sheet solving the problem she said
sometimes employers have problems relating to people with disabilities reed said with me being there they realize they're just like ordinary people
employment programs help foster independence among disabled persons and contribute to the larger public good said renee west reed's boss at the disability resource center
they become citizens like everyone else and pay taxes like everyone else she said
in her first term whitman frustrated advocates for the disabled with her initial reluctance to cut independent living waiting lists for the developmentally disabled
but some of those early critics were cheered by her announcement last week that there is $72 million in combined state and federal funds for the disabled including the funds for the employment program tucked into her proposed $213 billion budget 	 the governor's new initiative to help new jersey citizens who have disabilities is a step in the right direction said lois mattson director of the new jersey psychiatric rehabilitation association people who have mental illness want what everyone wants a good job and a nice affordable place to call home
other groups praising the governor included the arc of new jersey which represents developmentally disabled people and the association for choices in community supports and employment services
among the governor's proposals
the budget's overarching theme is fostering independence for people with disabilities these are more steps in an overall policy direction to enable people to live productive lives said human services commissioner michele guhl
portugal found the sure-score formula after the half and used it for four straight goals forwards stripped the ball from the harassed lichtenstein defense while midfielders hung by the net for the cross
joao pinto did it alone in the 54th minute robbing an upfield pass and blasting it back from 40 meters out to score
lichtenstein was unable to move the ball past the swarming portuguese forwards withing three minutes fernando couto antonio folha and paulo alves had scored identical goals outmuscling the defense to head in crosses and running the score to 7-0 by the 63rd minute
we've seen too much overuse and abuse of the legal justice system said rep jim ramstad the bill's lead sponsor
the act aims to discourage frivolous lawsuits and limit outlandish outrageously excessive awards that are based on emotion and not reason he said
but washington personal injury lawyer barry nace calls the proposed law the corporate irresponsibility protection bill
punitive damages are given for serious corporate misconduct not ordinary negligence said michael rustad a professor at suffolk university law school in boston
the modern concept of damages dates back to a british court's award of 1000 pounds sterling in 1763 to a publisher after he was arrested and his business searched because his newspaper sharply criticized king george iii the court called the search a most daring public attack on personal liberty
these days punitive damages are awarded in less than 1 percent of all product liability cases a teaspoon in the ocean of litigation rustad said although such awards can reach into the millions of dollars most are reduced or eliminated on appeal or in post-trial settlements
in the 1978 pinto case a judge reduced the punitive-damage award against ford to dlrs 3 million the woman who sued mcdonald's over its scalding coffee saw her punitive damage award reduced to dlrs 480000 she later settled for an undisclosed amount presumably even smaller rather than face further appeals
ramstad's bill would allow punitive damages in product liability cases only when someone can prove by clear and convincing evidence that the harm they suffered was caused by actual malice

with no-confidence votes looming this week for premier silvio berlusconi's tottering coalition a former italian leader on sunday urged quick formation of a new government to avoid further damage to italy in international markets

berlusconi was scheduled to speak to parliament about his government on wednesday that was to be followed by a total of 22 hours of debate chamber president irene pivetti said sunday pushing off any vote on the no-confidence motions to late thursday at the earliest in the chamber
i hope that the political forces and constitutional organs that have the responsibility for dealing with the crisis resolve in a wisely rapid timeframe the problem of forming a new government francesco cossiga a former christian democratic premier and later head of state told reporters
that which damages italy on the international arena is uncertainty cossiga added
if berlusconi's coalition does lose the confidence vote much depends whether the northern league will follow bossi's call to side with the former communists political leaders will begin a round of consultations with president oscar luigi scalfaro
scalfaro could ask berlusconi to try again say with new partners to replace bossi such as the center-left popular party of rocco buttiglione or the opposition parties led by massimo dalema of the former communists and bolstered by bossi loyalists could be asked to form what would be postwar republic's 54th government
